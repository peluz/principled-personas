"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first determine how many eggs she has left after eating and baking. 

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and bakes 4 for muffins, so she uses a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. 

Now, let's subtract the number of eggs she uses from the total number of eggs she lays: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 each. To find out how much she makes, we multiply the number of eggs she sells by the price per egg: 9 * 2 = 18.

So, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

"To find the total number of bolts needed for the robe, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, we can calculate the white fiber as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts (blue fiber) / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we add the blue fiber and white fiber to get the total number of bolts:

Total bolts = 2 bolts (blue fiber) + 1 bolt (white fiber) = 3 bolts

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit Josh made, we first need to determine the total value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

To find the new value of the house, we can set up an equation: 

New Value = Original Value + (Original Value * 150% of the original value)

New Value = $80,000 + ($80,000 * 1.5)

New Value = $80,000 + $120,000

New Value = $200,000

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost (purchase price + repairs) from the new value of the house.

Total Cost = $80,000 (purchase price) + $50,000 (repairs) = $130,000

Profit = New Value - Total Cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

The final answer is: $70,000"
"To find the total number of meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he has in a week.

Since James runs 3 sprints in one session, and each sprint is 60 meters, the total meters he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James runs 3 sessions a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

Therefore, James runs a total of 540 meters a week. 

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to determine the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals. 

In the morning, Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. Since she feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed, we can calculate the number of chickens as follows: 15 cups / 3 cups per chicken = 5 chickens. However, this is not the size of the flock, so we can ignore this calculation.

The total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals is 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups.

Since Wendi feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed, and she has a flock of 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed for the entire day is 20 chickens * 3 cups per chicken = 60 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals from the total amount of feed needed for the entire day: 60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 
The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * $3 = $1.8. 
We can see that the cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of the previous glass. 

The sequence of the cost of the glasses is: $5, $3, $1.8, $1.08, $0.64, $0.384, $0.2304, $0.13824, $0.082944, $0.0497664, $0.02986584, $0.017949504, $0.010794903, $0.00646784128, $0.003863960576, $0.0023281813456, $0.0014005088032.

To find the total cost, we need to sum up the cost of all the glasses. 
Total cost = $5 + $3 + $1.8 + $1.08 + $0.64 + $0.384 + $0.2304 + $0.13824 + $0.082944 + $0.0497664 + $0.02986584 + $0.017949504 + $0.010794903 + $0.00646784128 + $0.003863960576 + $0.0023281813456 + $0.0014005088032

"Let's break down the information given. 

Seattle has 20 sheep. 
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep. 
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in each city: 20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260.

"To find the total time it takes Carla to download the file, we need to calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file.

First, let's find the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 x 200 = 80 GB. Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Next, we need to add the time it takes to install the updates, which is 20 minutes.

Now, we need to find the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file. 60% of 200 GB is 0.6 x 200 = 120 GB. The time it takes to download 120 GB is 120 / 2 = 60 minutes.

The total time it takes to download the file is the sum of the time it takes to download the first 40%, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the remaining 60%. 

Total time = 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the distance covered in each segment.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. The distance covered in this segment is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

Since he turns around, he is now 180 miles away from home.

Next, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance in this segment.

Then, he drives for half an hour (0.5 hours) at 30 mph. The distance covered in this segment is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

Now, he is 180 - 15 = 165 miles away from home.

Finally, he drives for the remaining 2.5 hours (4 - 1.5 hours) at 80 mph. The distance covered in this segment is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 2.5 = 200 miles

Now, he is 165 - 200 = -35 miles away from home. However, since distance cannot be negative, this means he is actually 35 miles away from home.

The final answer is: 35"
"To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so her overtime rate is:
$10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour

Her earnings for the overtime hours are:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total earnings for the week = $400 + $60 = $460

"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and then add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it's 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. Then, we subtract 54 from 180 to get 126 downloads in the third month.

Now, let's add the downloads for each month together: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the donuts: 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen is 3 x $68 = $204.

Next, let's find the cost of the mini cupcakes: 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen is 2 x $80 = $160.

Now, let's find the cost of the mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen is 6 x $55 = $330.

Finally, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of planting the tree and the annual expenses, and then find the point at which the total earnings from selling lemons exceed these costs.

The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. The annual expenses for watering and feeding the tree are $3. 

Each year, the tree will grow 7 lemons, which can be sold for $1.5 each, resulting in a total annual income of 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.

To find the break-even point, we need to calculate the total cost of the tree and the total annual expenses, and then find the point at which the total earnings from selling lemons exceed these costs.

Let's denote the number of years it takes to break even as 'x'. The total cost of the tree is $90, and the total annual expenses are $3. The total earnings from selling lemons in 'x' years will be $10.5x.

The equation to find the break-even point is:

Total cost = Total earnings - Total expenses
$90 = $10.5x - $3x

Combine like terms:
$90 = $7.5x

Now, divide both sides by $7.5:
x = $90 / $7.5
x = 12

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the information given. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. If we let x be the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with, then she sold x/3 at the green house.

After selling at the green house, Melanie has (x - x/3) = (2x/3) vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, she has (2x/3 - 2) vacuum cleaners left.

Next, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. Half of (2x/3 - 2) is (1/2)(2x/3 - 2) = (x/3 - 1).

Now, Melanie has (2x/3 - 2 - (x/3 - 1)) = (x/3 - 1) vacuum cleaners left. We are given that she has 5 vacuum cleaners left.

So, we can set up the equation: x/3 - 1 = 5. 

To solve for x, we add 1 to both sides: x/3 = 6.

Then, we multiply both sides by 3: x = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find out how many students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, and then subtract that from the total number of students.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20 * 0.2 = 4 students

The remaining students after contemporary dance is: 20 - 4 = 16 students

25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance:
16 * 0.25 = 4 students

The remaining students after jazz dance is: 16 - 4 = 12 students

These 12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

"To determine the maximum profit, we need to calculate the potential increase in value for both options and then compare them.

For the jewelry option, the potential increase in value is 2.5% of $5,000, which is 0.025 * $5,000 = $125.

For the electronic gadgets option, the potential increase in value is 1.2% of $8,000, which is 0.012 * $8,000 = $96.

Since the jewelry option has a higher potential increase in value, the merchant should choose the jewelry option to maximize profit.

The potential profit from the jewelry option is the increase in value, which is $125.

The final answer is: $125"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered on the first day and the distance covered on the second day.

On the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance. 

On the second day, they travel 150 miles northward. Again, since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance.

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles.

"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:

She works 35 hours a week as a teacher and gets paid $20 per hour. Since she works 50 weeks a year, her total hours worked as a teacher in a year is:
35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year

Her earnings from teaching in a year is:
1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:

She works 15 hours a week as a coach and gets paid $30 per hour. Since she works 50 weeks a year, her total hours worked as a coach in a year is:
15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year

Her earnings from coaching in a year is:
750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
$35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To find out how many eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week and then multiply it by 4.

Since Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. 

There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she eats 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week.

In 4 weeks, she will eat 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she will eat in 4 weeks.

84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens.

So, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much time Marissa has left to walk the remaining distance. 

She has walked 4 miles in 1 hour and 2 miles in another hour, so she has walked a total of 6 miles in 2 hours. 

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles, and she has already walked 6 miles, so she has 12 - 6 = 6 miles left to walk.

Since she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, and the total distance is 12 miles, she needs to cover the total distance in 12 / 4 = 3 hours.

She has already walked for 2 hours, so she has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left to walk the remaining 6 miles.

To find her required speed, we divide the remaining distance by the remaining time: 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total amount of water in the orange drink, we first need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, this means 6.67 liters of the orange drink is water.

Next, we calculate the total amount of water in the pineapple drink, which is three-fifths of 15 liters. Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 9 liters. 

Now, we have 6.67 liters of water from the orange drink and 9 liters of water from the pineapple drink. However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, which means we have 6.67 - 1 = 5.67 liters of water from the orange drink left.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is the sum of the water from the orange drink and the pineapple drink: 5.67 + 9 = 14.67 liters.

The final answer is: 14.67"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha.
2. Samantha is now 31 years old.
3. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old.
4. Raymond had a son at the age of 23, so the son is 25 - 23 = 2 years younger than Raymond.
5. Since the son is 2 years younger than Raymond, and Raymond is 25 years old, the son is 25 - 2 = 23 years old.
6. To find out how many years ago the son was born, we need to subtract his age from the current year. However, the current year is not given, but we can find the difference in age between Samantha and the son, which is 31 - 23 = 8 years.

Since we don't have the current year, we can't find the exact year the son was born, but we can find the difference in age between Samantha and the son, which is 8 years.

However, if we assume the current year is 2024, and Samantha is 31, then Samantha was born in 1993. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, Raymond was born in 1987. Raymond had a son at the age of 23, so the son was born in 1987 + 23 = 2010.

"To find out how many DVDs Billy sold, we need to calculate the total number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought a total of 3 DVDs. 

The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought a total of 2 * 2 = 4 DVDs.

Now, let's add the total number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers: 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

So, Billy sold 7 DVDs to the first 5 customers. The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so we don't need to add any DVDs to the total.

Therefore, Billy sold a total of 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to determine the amount of the discount and add it to the discounted price. 

First, let's find the amount of the discount: 
Discount = 25% of the original price
Let's call the original price 'x'. 
Discount = 0.25x

Since the discounted price is $19.50, we can set up the equation:
x - 0.25x = 19.50
Combine like terms:
0.75x = 19.50
Now, divide both sides by 0.75 to solve for x:
x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6. 

The total cost of the items excluding pizza is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33. 

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17. 

Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is $17 / $8.50 = 2.

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she buys and then multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will go through 60 servings in 60 days. Each carton has 15 servings, so we need to divide 60 by 15 to find out how many cartons she buys:

60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Now, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton:

4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

So, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

First, let's find the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip. Since Henry's second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip is 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

Now, we know that Henry traveled 20 miles before his first stop. To find the distance between the first and second stops, we need to subtract the distance traveled before the first stop from the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip. 

Distance between the first and second stops = Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip - Distance traveled before the first stop
= 45 miles - 20 miles
= 25 miles

"Let's break down the information given. We know that one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, which means the second pair costs 2 * $33 = $66. 

The total cost of the two pairs of heels is $33 + $66 = $99. We are also told that the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. 

Let's represent the cost of the boots as 'x'. Since the two pairs of heels cost $99 and they are five dollars less than the boots, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 99.

To find the cost of the boots, we need to solve for 'x'. We can do this by adding 5 to both sides of the equation: x = 99 + 5.

x = 104

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let Darrell's age be 7x and Allen's age be 11x, where x is a constant. 

Since their total age is 162, we can write the equation: 
7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 
18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: 
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Darrell's and Allen's current ages: 
Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the total number of guesses and divide by the number of people.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.
The second person guesses 20 more than half of the first one, which is (80 / 2) + 20 = 60.
The third person guesses 25% more than the first one, which is 80 + (80 * 0.25) = 100.

Now, let's add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

There are 3 people, so we divide the total by 3 to find the average: 240 / 3 = 80.

"To find the total hours John spends taking care of the dogs in a week, we need to first calculate the total hours he spends per day. 

Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day, and John has 10 dogs. So, the total hours per day is 0.5 * 10 = 5 hours.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the total hours per day by 7 to get the total hours per week. 

5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'. 

We know that the total number of coins is 110, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 30) = 110.

Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 110.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

Since x represents the number of silver coins, and there are 30 more gold coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which is 1. Then, we add this to the original 4 points to get the total points scored in the second 20 minutes: 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The total points Mike scored is 9."

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. In 30 days, he will eat 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The sale is 4 yogurts for $5.00. To find the cost of 1 yogurt, we divide $5.00 by 4. So, the cost of 1 yogurt is $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.

Now, we multiply the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days (60) by the cost of 1 yogurt ($1.25) to find the total cost. 60 * $1.25 = $75.00.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To find out how many LEGO sets John still has, we need to first calculate how much money he made from selling the LEGO sets and then subtract the money he spent on video games and the remaining amount he has.

John sells 13 LEGO sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is:
13 LEGO sets * $15 per set = $195

He then buys 8 video games for $20 each, so the total amount of money he spent on video games is:
8 video games * $20 per game = $160

After buying the video games, he has $5 left. To find out how much money he spent in total, we subtract the remaining amount from the total amount he made:
$195 - $5 = $190

Now, we subtract the money he spent on video games from the total amount he spent:
$190 - $160 = $30

This means he spent $30 on something else, but we don't know what. However, we are asked to find out how many LEGO sets he still has. Since we know he made $195 and spent $30, we can find out how many LEGO sets he sold for $30:
$30 / $15 per set = 2 LEGO sets

So, John sold 2 LEGO sets for $30. To find out how many LEGO sets he still has, we subtract the number of sets he sold from the total number of sets he had:
13 LEGO sets - 2 LEGO sets = 11 LEGO sets

The final answer is: 11"
"To find John's running speed, we first need to calculate the total hours he runs per week. 

He runs 3 hours on the first day. The other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours per day. 

So, the total hours he runs per week is 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours.

Since John runs 60 miles a week and runs for 6 hours a week, we can find his speed by dividing the total miles by the total hours: 

Speed = Total miles / Total hours = 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running and walking speeds. 

Given that Dana can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, and she can skip at 3 miles per hour, we can find her running speed by multiplying her skipping speed by 2. 

Dana's running speed = 2 * 3 miles per hour = 6 miles per hour.

Since Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, we can find her walking speed by dividing her running speed by 4.

Dana's walking speed = 6 miles per hour / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, we know that Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, in 6 hours, she spends 2 hours running and 4 hours walking.

Distance traveled while running = speed * time = 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.

Distance traveled while walking = speed * time = 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours = 6 miles.

Total distance traveled = distance traveled while running + distance traveled while walking = 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.
2. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, so Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.
3. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, so Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone. Since she can throw it three times farther than when not holding the gemstone, we multiply the original distance by 3.

Original distance = 400 feet
Distance with gemstone = 3 * 400 = 1200 feet

Now, we need to find the distance outside the dragon's reach where Polly can still hit the dragon. The dragon's reach is 1000 feet, so Polly needs to be at least 1000 feet away from the dragon to be outside its reach.

Distance outside reach = Distance with gemstone - Dragon's reach
= 1200 - 1000
= 200 feet

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit it with the gold javelin.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to first find out the total number of pieces of pie that were available. Since Grandma Jones cut each pie into 8 pieces and she baked 5 pies, the total number of pieces is 5 * 8 = 40.

Now, we know that at the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces: 40 - 14 = 26.

So, the guests took 26 pieces of pie.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how many calories you can still consume, we need to subtract the calories you've already consumed from your daily target. 

Daily calorie target: 2000 calories
Calories already consumed: 1800 calories
Remaining calories: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, we need to find out how many servings you can have with 200 calories.

Remaining calories: 200
Calories per serving: 250
Number of servings: 200 / 250 = 0.8

Since there are 5 servings in a 300g bag, we need to find out how many grams are in 0.8 servings.

Number of servings in a bag: 5
Number of servings you can have: 0.8
Fraction of the bag: 0.8 / 5 = 0.16

To find the grams, we multiply the fraction of the bag by the total weight of the bag.

Total weight of the bag: 300g
Fraction of the bag: 0.16
Weight of chips you can eat: 300 * 0.16 = 48g

The final answer is: 48"
"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

First, let's find the total cost. Since one pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00, and Charlie makes 10 candles per pound, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles. The total cost of the beeswax and wicks for 20 candles is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.

Next, let's find the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles, so the total revenue is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

Now, let's find the net profit. The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. So, the net profit is $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we first need to determine the number of articles she wrote each day.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. To find this, we multiply the number of articles she wrote on Monday by 2/5 and add it to the original number of articles. 
2/5 * 5 = 2
5 + 2 = 7

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. 
2 * 7 = 14

Now, we have the number of articles she wrote each day: 5, 7, and 14. To find the total number of hours she spent writing, we multiply the number of articles by the time it takes to write each article (4 hours) and add them together.
5 * 4 = 20
7 * 4 = 28
14 * 4 = 56
20 + 28 + 56 = 104

The total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is 104."
"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to first determine how many Post-it notes she used in total. 

Candice started with 80 Post-it notes. She used 220 Post-it notes at work. To find the total number of Post-it notes she used, we add these two numbers together: 80 + 220 = 300. 

Since she had 23 Post-it notes remaining, we need to subtract this from the total number of Post-it notes she used to find out how many she purchased: 300 - 23 = 277.

The final answer is: 277"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. To find the number of blue ties, we can divide the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost per tie:

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

Now, we know that the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. This means the cost of a red tie is 1.5 times the cost of a blue tie:

Cost of a red tie = 1.5 * Cost of a blue tie
= 1.5 * $40
= $60

To find the total amount spent on red ties, we multiply the number of red ties by the cost per red tie:

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

The total amount spent on ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches, since the pieces are 6 inches long. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the total length of the wire in inches is 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.

Now, we can divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces Tracy obtained: 48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of units in the building, we need to multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor. 

Number of floors: 15
Number of units per floor: 8

Total units = Number of floors * Number of units per floor
Total units = 15 * 8
Total units = 120

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total units to determine the number of unoccupied units.

1/4 of the total units = (1/4) * Total units
1/4 of the total units = (1/4) * 120
1/4 of the total units = 30

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we first need to calculate how many eggs he produces in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of eggs produced per day by 7.

Eggs produced per day: 252
Eggs produced per week: 252 * 7 = 1764

Next, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs Lloyd produces in a week. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs produced per week by 12.

Eggs produced per week: 1764
Dozens of eggs produced per week: 1764 / 12 = 147

Now, we know that Lloyd sells each dozen of eggs for $2. To find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply the number of dozens of eggs produced per week by the price per dozen.

Price per dozen: $2
Dozens of eggs produced per week: 147
Weekly earnings: 147 * $2 = $294

The final answer is: $294"
"To find the total time it takes for Tom to travel back, we first need to determine the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since we don't know the exact distance, let's assume it's 'd' miles. 

The time taken to travel from 1 to 4 PM is d / 10 hours. 

Now, the time taken to travel back is d / 6 hours. 

The total time taken is the sum of these two times: d / 10 + d / 6.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 30. 

So, the total time is (3d + 5d) / 30 = 8d / 30 = 4d / 15 hours.

However, we still need to find the value of 'd'. To do this, we need to know the distance. Since we don't have the distance, let's assume it's a round trip, and the total time is 4 hours. 

The time taken from 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours. 

So, the time taken to travel back is 4 - 3 = 1 hour.

Now, we can find the distance 'd'. The time taken to travel back is d / 6 = 1 hour. 

d = 6 miles.

Now that we have the distance, we can find the total time taken to travel back. 

The time taken to travel back is d / 6 = 6 / 6 = 1 hour.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much weight the comic books are removing from the bag. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and Uriah removes 30 comic books, the total weight removed by the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, the remaining weight that needs to be removed by the toys is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so to find out how many toys need to be removed, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total revenue for each day, we need to calculate the revenue from truck tires and car tires separately and then add them together.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires at $60 each and 4 car tires at $40 each. 
Revenue from truck tires on Thursday = 6 * $60 = $360
Revenue from car tires on Thursday = 4 * $40 = $160
Total revenue on Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires at $40 each and no truck tires.
Revenue from car tires on Friday = 12 * $40 = $480
Total revenue on Friday = $480

To find the day with higher revenue, we compare the total revenue on Thursday and Friday. 
Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue.

Now, to find how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we subtract the revenue of the day with lower revenue from the day with higher revenue.
Difference in revenue = $520 - $480 = $40

"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate how many times he can afford the total cost of a movie outing, which includes both the ticket and the popcorn.

The total cost of a movie outing is $7 (ticket) + $7 (popcorn) = $14.

We know Peter has $42 for the week. To find out how many times he can go to the movies, we'll divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of a single movie outing.

$42 Ã· $14 = 3

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week.

"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to first calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after the truck and driver are on it. 

The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. The weight limit of the bridge is 5000 pounds. 

Remaining weight capacity = Weight limit - Combined weight of driver and empty truck
Remaining weight capacity = 5000 - 3755
Remaining weight capacity = 1245 pounds

Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we can find the maximum number of boxes by dividing the remaining weight capacity by the weight of each box.

Maximum number of boxes = Remaining weight capacity / Weight of each box
Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15
Maximum number of boxes = 83

"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to first calculate the total cost after the delivery vendor's fee. 

The delivery vendor's fee is 25% of the final bill, which is $40.00. To find 25% of $40.00, we multiply $40.00 by 0.25. 

$40.00 * 0.25 = $10.00

Now, we add the delivery fee of $3.00 to the vendor's fee of $10.00. 

$10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00

The total cost after the vendor's fee and delivery fee is $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00.

Stephen also added a $4.00 tip to the total cost.

"To find Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we first need to calculate the value of the pension after 30 years. Since she gets 5% of the value of the pension per year after 20 years, we can calculate the value of the pension after 30 years as follows:

The pension after 20 years is 50,000 * 1 (since she gets the full pension for the first 20 years). 
The pension after 21 years is 50,000 * 1 + (50,000 * 0.05) = 50,000 + 2,500 = 52,500
The pension after 22 years is 52,500 + (52,500 * 0.05) = 52,500 + 2,625 = 55,125
The pension after 23 years is 55,125 + (55,125 * 0.05) = 55,125 + 2,756.25 = 57,881.25
The pension after 24 years is 57,881.25 + (57,881.25 * 0.05) = 57,881.25 + 2,894.06 = 60,775.31
The pension after 25 years is 60,775.31 + (60,775.31 * 0.05) = 60,775.31 + 3,038.77 = 63,814.08
The pension after 26 years is 63,814.08 + (63,814.08 * 0.05) = 63,814.08 + 3,190.7 = 67,004.78
The pension after 27 years is 67,004.78 + (67,004.78 * 0.05) = 67,004.78 + 3,350.24 = 70,355.02
The pension after 28 years is 70,355.02 + (70,355.02 * 0.05) = 70,355.02 + 3,517.75 = 73,872.77
The pension after 29 years is 73,872.77 + (73,872.77 * 0.05) = 73,872.77 + 3,693.36 = 77,566.13
The pension after 30 years is 77,566.13 + (77,566.13 * 0.05) = 77,566.13 + 3,878.31 = 81,444.44

So, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be $81,444.44."
"To find the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to calculate the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately and then add them together.

The streaming service charges $140 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the first half of the year consists of 6 months. 

The amount Aleena paid for the first half of the year is 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charged her 10% less money. To find the amount she paid for the second half of the year, we need to calculate 10% of $140 and subtract it from $140.

10% of $140 = 0.1 * $140 = $14

The amount Aleena paid for the second half of the year is $140 - $14 = $126.

Now, we add the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year to find the total amount she paid for the streaming service by the end of the year.

Total amount = $840 + $126 = $966

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to determine the car's miles per gallon (mpg) rating. We can do this by dividing the distance traveled since the last fill-up (100 miles) by the amount of gas used (4 gallons).

mpg = distance / gas used
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know the car's mpg rating, we can calculate the total distance Sophia can drive on a full tank by multiplying the tank capacity (12 gallons) by the mpg rating.

total distance = tank capacity * mpg
total distance = 12 gallons * 25 miles/gallon
total distance = 300 miles

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

"To find the total number of people sent by the schools, we need to calculate the number of students and coaches for both the girls' and boys' teams.

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players. So, the total number of students from each school is 2 teams * 5 players/team = 10 students.

Each school also has a coach for each team, so there are 2 coaches per school.

Now, we multiply the number of students and coaches per school by the total number of schools to find the total number of people sent by all schools.

Total students = 10 students/school * 4 schools = 40 students
Total coaches = 2 coaches/school * 4 schools = 8 coaches

Total people = Total students + Total coaches = 40 + 8 = 48

43 brownies * $3 per brownie = 43 * 3 = $129

Next, let's calculate the total amount from the cheesecakes: 
23 cheesecakes * $4 per cheesecake = 23 * 4 = $92

Now, let's add the total amount from the brownies and the cheesecakes together: 
$129 + $92 = $221

"To find out how much Shiela will pay each month, we need to calculate the total cost of the cell phones first, then divide it by the number of months.

The total cost of the cell phones is 5 units * $150/unit = $750.

Since a 2% interest will be charged for each unit, the total interest for 5 units is 5 * 2% = 10% of the total cost.

The interest is 10% of $750 = 0.1 * $750 = $75.

So, the total amount Shiela needs to pay is the cost of the cell phones plus the interest, which is $750 + $75 = $825.

Since Shiela will pay this amount over 3 months, we need to divide the total amount by 3 to find out how much she will pay each month.

$825 / 3 = $275.

The final answer is: $275"

- Petunias: 9 pots * $2/pot = $18
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2/pot = $34

Now, let's add the total revenue from each type of flower:
$36 + $18 + $34 = $88

The final answer is: $88"
"To find the average square footage of a level, we need to first find the total square footage of the sandcastle and then divide it by the number of levels.

Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can start with the top level and work our way down. 

The top level has a square footage of 16. 
The second level will have half of 16, which is 8. 
The third level will have half of 8, which is 4. 
The fourth level will have half of 4, which is 2.

Now, we add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30.

There are 4 levels in total. To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels: 30 / 4 = 7.5.

The final answer is: 7.5"
"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of food the puppy will eat in the first year. 

First, let's find out how many days are in a year. There are 365 days in a year.

The puppy eats 1 cup of food for the first 180 days. So, the amount of food eaten in the first 180 days is 1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups.

The puppy eats 2 cups of food for the rest of its life, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days. So, the amount of food eaten in the rest of the year is 2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups.

The total amount of food eaten in the first year is 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags needed is 550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
- Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.
- Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so Raymond does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry.

To find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we subtract the amount David does from the amount Raymond does: 200 - 100 = 100.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 and packages of 2.

For packages of 3: 
- Each package costs $2.50
- To buy 18 flowers, Vincent needs 18 / 3 = 6 packages
- Total cost = 6 * $2.50 = $15

For packages of 2:
- Each package costs $1
- To buy 18 flowers, Vincent needs 18 / 2 = 9 packages
- Total cost = 9 * $1 = $9

The better price is $9 for 18 flowers. 

To find the savings, we subtract the better price from the higher price: 
$15 - $9 = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To find the cost of the grooming after the discount, we need to calculate 30% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

The original price is $100. 
30% of $100 is 0.3 x $100 = $30.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price: $100 - $30 = $70.

The final cost of the grooming is $70.

"To find out how much water the girls got, we need to calculate 1/6 of 24 liters. 

1/6 of 24 liters = (1/6) * 24 = 4 liters

Since there are two girls, they each got 4 liters of water. So, together they got 2 * 4 = 8 liters.

Now, let's subtract the water the girls got and the water the boy got from the total amount of water. 

Total water initially = 24 liters
Water the girls got = 8 liters
Water the boy got = 6 liters

Water left = Total water initially - (Water the girls got + Water the boy got)
= 24 - (8 + 6)
= 24 - 14
= 10 liters

First, we multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush: 3 * 25 = 75

Then, we multiply the result by the number of thorns per rose: 75 * 8 = 600

So, there are 600 thorns in total."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of games they lost is x. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is x + 8.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, which is the sum of the games won and lost. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

So, the number of games they lost is 7. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is:

x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of times it rang each time it went off and add them up.

The first time it went off, it rang 4 times.

The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.

The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of times the alarm rang: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we first need to calculate her salary after five years of service, and then calculate the increase for the next three years.

Initially, Sylvie's salary is $600. 

After one year, her salary will be 600 + (10% of 600) = 600 + 60 = $660.

After two years, her salary will be 660 + (10% of 660) = 660 + 66 = $726.

After three years, her salary will be 726 + (10% of 726) = 726 + 72.6 = $798.60.

After four years, her salary will be 798.60 + (10% of 798.60) = 798.60 + 79.86 = $878.46.

After five years, her salary will be 878.46 + (10% of 878.46) = 878.46 + 87.85 = $966.31.

Now, for the next three years, her salary will increase by 10% each year. 

After six years, her salary will be 966.31 + (10% of 966.31) = 966.31 + 96.63 = $1062.94.

After seven years, her salary will be 1062.94 + (10% of 1062.94) = 1062.94 + 106.29 = $1169.23.

After eight years, her salary will be 1169.23 + (10% of 1169.23) = 1169.23 + 116.92 = $1286.15.

So, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service will be $1286.15."
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. If we let the number of copies Harald sold be 'x', then the number of copies Marilyn sold would be 10x.

We also know that the total number of copies sold by both of them is 88,000. So, we can set up the equation: x + 10x = 88,000.

Combining like terms, we get 11x = 88,000.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 11: x = 88,000 / 11.

x = 8,000.

The final answer is: 8000"
"To find out how many gift bags Christina needs, we first need to calculate the number of guests she expects to attend. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, we can find the number of guests who will attend by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of invited guests.

16 (invited guests) - (1/4 * 16) = 16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply the number of guests attending by 0.75.

12 (guests) * 0.75 (gift bags per guest) = 9

So, Christina needs 9 gift bags. 

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag.

9 (gift bags) * $2 (cost per gift bag) = $18

"To find Gerald's new time, we first need to find out how long it took him to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can set up an equation: 

Lee's time = Gerald's time + 2 seconds
38 = Gerald's time + 2

Now, we can solve for Gerald's original time:
Gerald's time = 38 - 2
Gerald's time = 36 seconds

Gerald's speed improved by 10%, so we need to find 10% of his original time and add it to his original time to find his new time:
10% of 36 = 0.1 * 36 = 3.6 seconds
New time = Original time + 10% of original time
New time = 36 + 3.6
New time = 39.6 seconds

The final answer is: 39.6"

"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls and then subtract the number of girls in the girl scout.

First, let's find the number of boys and girls. We know that 2/5 of the students are boys. 

Number of boys = (2/5) * 200 = 80

Since there are 200 students in total, the number of girls can be found by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students.

Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

Now, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = (2/3) * 120 = 80

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 2 episodes of a 1-hour show, which is 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's call the number of episodes 'x'. Since each episode is 30 minutes, the total time he watched on Wednesday is 30x minutes.

On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes of TV. Converting 1 hour to minutes, we get 60 minutes. So, the total time he watched on Thursday is 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.

On Friday, he watched 2 episodes of a 1-hour show, which is 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

The total time Frankie watched TV is 7 hours. Converting this to minutes, we get 7 * 60 = 420 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time he watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday: 2 + 2 + 90 + 2 * 60 = 2 + 2 + 90 + 120 = 214 minutes.

The time he watched on Wednesday is the difference between the total time and the time he watched on other days: 420 - 214 = 206 minutes.

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we can find the number of episodes by dividing the total time by 30: 206 / 30 = 6.8666. Since we can't have a fraction of an episode, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of episodes, and the question asks for the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday. 

206 minutes is 6 full episodes and 26 minutes. Since 26 minutes is more than half of a 30-minute episode, we can round up to the nearest whole number. However, the question asks for the number of 30-minute episodes, so we should count the full episodes and the partial episode as a full episode. Therefore, the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is 7."
"Let's break down the information given. 

Let x be the number of cookies Henry baked last year. Since Henry wants to make twice as many as he did last year, he plans to bake 2x cookies this year.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. This means that the number of cookies he baked is 110 + 5 = 115.

We can set up an equation to represent this situation: 2x + 15 = 115.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 115 - 15, which simplifies to 2x = 100.

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x: x = 100 / 2, which simplifies to x = 50.

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To find the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of gas without the rewards, and then subtract the cashback amount.

The cost of gas per gallon is $3.00, and the person is buying 10 gallons. 

Total cost of gas = cost per gallon * number of gallons
Total cost of gas = $3.00 * 10
Total cost of gas = $30.00

The cashback reward is $0.20 per gallon, and the person is buying 10 gallons.

Total cashback = cashback per gallon * number of gallons
Total cashback = $0.20 * 10
Total cashback = $2.00

Now, we subtract the total cashback from the total cost of gas to find the final cost.

Final cost = Total cost of gas - Total cashback
Final cost = $30.00 - $2.00
Final cost = $28.00

"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by each person, we need to multiply the width and length of each roll-up. 

Beatrice's roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 rolls long, so the total number of roll-ups is 2 * 24 = 48.

Marcell's roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 rolls long, so the total number of roll-ups is 3 * 14 = 42.

To find the average number of roll-ups eaten, we need to add the total number of roll-ups eaten by each person and divide by 2. 

Total roll-ups eaten = 48 + 42 = 90

Average roll-ups eaten = 90 / 2 = 45

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to calculate the rate at which the boat is taking on water and then multiply it by the total time it took to reach the shore.

First, let's find the rate at which the boat is taking on water. It takes 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, and it takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet. 

Since 20 feet is twice 10 feet, the boat will take on twice the amount of water in the same time. So, for 20 feet, the boat takes on 2 * 2 = 4 liters of water in 16 seconds.

Now, we need to find out how many 20-foot intervals are there in 64 seconds. To do this, we divide 64 seconds by 16 seconds (the time it takes to row 20 feet). 

64 / 16 = 4

This means there are 4 intervals of 20 feet in 64 seconds. Since the boat takes on 4 liters of water in each 20-foot interval, it will take on 4 * 4 = 16 liters of water in 64 seconds.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to calculate the total number of lessons and then multiply it by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

Each teacher has 2 lessons per day, and there are 4 teachers. So, the total number of lessons per day is 2 * 4 = 8 lessons.

The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson. Therefore, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is 8 lessons * 3 cleanings per lesson = 24 cleanings.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total number of flowers Ryan has, we need to calculate the total number of flowers he planted and subtract the ones that did not grow.

Ryan plants 2 flowers a day. After 15 days, he would have planted 2 * 15 = 30 flowers.

However, 5 of these flowers did not grow. So, we need to subtract 5 from the total number of flowers planted.

Total flowers = 30 - 5 = 25

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. This means if Jamal's phone can hold x photographs, then Brittany's phone can hold x/6 photographs.

We are given that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. So, Brittany's phone can hold 1800/6 = 300 photographs.

The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This means if the number of birds in Jamal's photograph is y, then 300 = 50y.

To find the number of birds in Jamal's photograph, we need to solve for y. 

300 = 50y
y = 300 / 50
y = 6

So, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total cost of the lumber, we need to calculate the cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards and the 4 x 4 x 10 boards separately and then add them together.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $10 per board = $100.

The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $16 per board = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the lumber is 1.5 times the original price. 

The new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 per board.

The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 per board.

The total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $15 per board = $150.

The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $24 per board = $120.

The total revenue is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we need to determine the total parts in the ratio and then find the fraction of the total that represents the sugar. 

The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, so the total parts in the ratio is 7 + 13 = 20.

Since Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and water, we can set up a proportion to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar:

(7/20) = x/120

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

7 * 120 = 20x
840 = 20x
x = 840 / 20
x = 42

The final answer is: 42"
"To find the total amount John paid, we need to calculate the cost of the shoes for all his children. 

First, we find the cost of shoes for one child: 2 pairs * $60 per pair = $120.

Then, we multiply this by the number of children: $120 * 3 = $360.

So, John paid a total of $360."
"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we first need to determine the total number of vehicles that were already at the port. We know that there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles initially is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30. To find the number of vehicles brought in on the second day, we subtract the initial number of vehicles from the total number of vehicles: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers brought in on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles brought in by the number of vehicles per container: 20 / 5 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find Lylah's original salary. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship.

Let L be Lylah's original salary. Then, Adrien's original salary is 1.3L (since 30% more is the same as multiplying by 1.3).

We are given that Adrien's original salary was $40000. So, we can set up the equation:

1.3L = 40000

To solve for L, we can divide both sides by 1.3:

L = 40000 / 1.3
L = 30769.23

Now that we know Lylah's original salary, we can find Adrien's salary four years later. We are told that Adrien's salary increased by 40% over this period. This means his new salary is 1.4 times his original salary.

Adrien's new salary = 1.4 * 40000
Adrien's new salary = 56000

We also need to find Lylah's new salary. Since their salaries increased simultaneously, we can assume that Lylah's salary also increased by 40%. 

Lylah's new salary = 1.4 * 30769.23
Lylah's new salary = 43156.5222

Now, we can find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later:

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = 56000 + 43156.5222
Total salary = 99156.5222

The final answer is: $99157"
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to first calculate how many sheets he uses in a week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a month.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So, the total number of sheets he uses in a week is 2 pads * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the number of sheets Miguel uses in a week by 4 to find the total number of sheets he uses in a month: 60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of fruits, we first need to determine the number of fruits each person brought. 

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. 

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, so Kael brought 2 * 5 = 10 apples. 
Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, so Kael brought 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

Now, we need to find the total number of fruits each person brought. 
Morisette brought 5 + 8 = 13 fruits. 
Kael brought 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of fruits each person brought. 
13 (Morisette's fruits) + 14 (Kael's fruits) = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate the hours she slept each day and add them up.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than the previous two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours she slept for each period:

- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday and Wednesday: 2 days * 6 hours = 12 hours
- Thursday to Sunday: 5 days * 7 hours = 35 hours

Now, let's add up the total hours: 8 + 12 + 35 = 55

"To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour.

First, let's calculate the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. 

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's calculate the remaining time after 3 hours, which is 7 - 3 = 4 hours. 

In the remaining 4 hours, she runs at 5 miles per hour. 

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distances from both parts to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours.

Total Distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total Distance = 50 miles

"Let's break down the information given. Jennie has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps. She puts stamps on one-third of these letters. This means she stamps 60 / 3 = 20 letters.

Now, we know that after stamping these 20 letters, the total number of letters in the already-stamped pile is 30. This means that before stamping the 20 letters, there were 30 - 20 = 10 letters in the already-stamped pile.

So, when Jennie began, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Julia initially bought a package of spoons, but we don't know the quantity yet. Her husband bought 5 more spoons and gave them to her. Julia used 3 spoons while making the stew. 

After her husband gave her the 5 spoons, Julia had the initial package of spoons plus 5 spoons. Let's call the initial number of spoons in the package 'x'. So, after her husband gave her the spoons, she had x + 5 spoons.

After Julia used 3 spoons, she had (x + 5) - 3 spoons left. 

We are told that when she went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons. So, we can set up the equation (x + 5) - 3 = 12.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. First, we add 3 to both sides of the equation: x + 5 - 3 + 3 = 12 + 3. This simplifies to x + 2 = 15.

Next, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: x + 2 - 2 = 15 - 2. This simplifies to x = 13.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages. 

First, let's find the number of fish sausages. Since Dylan bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, we can add 6 to the number of chicken sausages: 38 + 6 = 44.

Now, we can add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages to find the total: 38 + 44 = 82.

The final answer is: 82"
"To find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we first need to determine the number of friends Amy has. Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily has 50 friends, we can calculate Amy's friends by adding 20 to Lily's friends.

Amy's friends = Lily's friends + 20
Amy's friends = 50 + 20
Amy's friends = 70

Now, to find the total number of friends they have together, we add the number of friends Lily and Amy have.

Total friends = Lily's friends + Amy's friends
Total friends = 50 + 70
Total friends = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to determine the cost of each item and then multiply it by the quantity.

First, let's find the cost of a watermelon. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs $15, a watermelon costs 3 * $15 = $45.

Next, we find the cost of an orange. An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so an orange costs $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each item:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is the sum of the costs of all items: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

The final answer is: $880"
"To find the total profit, we first need to calculate the total time spent by doctors and the total amount charged to patients.

The hospital sees 500 people a day, and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. 

First, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours.

The total time spent by doctors is 500 patients * 0.4 hours per patient = 200 hours.

The doctors charge $150 an hour, so the total amount charged by doctors is 200 hours * $150 per hour = $30,000.

The hospital charges the patients $200 an hour, and the total time spent by patients is also 200 hours. So, the total amount charged to patients is 200 hours * $200 per hour = $40,000.

The profit made by the hospital is the difference between the total amount charged to patients and the total amount charged by doctors, which is $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

The hospital makes $10,000 profit from these visits."
"To find the number of elves left, we first need to determine how many elves quit after the children vomit on them. Since a third of the elves quit, we can calculate this as follows:

60 (initial elves) * 1/3 = 20 elves quit after being vomited on

Now, we subtract the elves who quit from the initial number to find the remaining elves:

60 - 20 = 40 elves remaining

Then, 10 more elves quit after being kicked by the kids. We subtract these from the remaining elves:

40 - 10 = 30 elves left

"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the total number of rides each person took and then multiply it by the cost per ride.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she rode a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides. 
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he rode a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used by Pam is 4 * 6 = 24 tickets.
The total number of tickets used by Fred is 6 * 6 = 36 tickets.

The total number of tickets used by both Pam and Fred is 24 + 36 = 60 tickets.

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. 
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, which is 4 * 6 = 24 miles.

Now, we know that his total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. We already know that he walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday. 

So, the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles. 

To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage for the three days: 41 - 28 = 13 miles.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 

First, let's find out how many questions Mark completed in 8 hours: 
8 hours * 5 questions per hour = 40 questions

Since Mark completed 40 questions in 8 hours, he left 75 - 40 = 35 questions incomplete in the first test.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at the same rate of 5 questions per hour.

Now, let's find out how many questions Mark completed in 6 hours: 
6 hours * 5 questions per hour = 30 questions

Since Mark completed 30 questions in 6 hours, he left 100 - 30 = 70 questions incomplete in the second test.

To find the total number of questions Mark left incomplete, we add the incomplete questions from both tests: 
35 (incomplete questions from the first test) + 70 (incomplete questions from the second test) = 105

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine the total number of semi-automatic cars. We know that there are 20 cars in total, with 12 being automatic and 4 being manual. 

Total number of cars = 20
Number of automatic cars = 12
Number of manual cars = 4

To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars:
Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Number of automatic cars + Number of manual cars)
= 20 - (12 + 4)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars by dividing the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiplying by 100:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
= (4 / 20) * 100

"Let's break down the information given. 

Let's denote the number of baby bees as B, the number of worker bees as W, and the number of queens as Q. 

We know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B. 

We also know that there are twice as many babies as queens, so B = 2Q.

We can express the total number of bees in terms of Q: W + B + Q = 700. 

Substituting W = 2B and B = 2Q into the equation, we get 2B + 2(2Q) + Q = 700. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 2B + 4Q + Q = 700, which is 2B + 5Q = 700.

Since B = 2Q, we can substitute this into the equation to get 2(2Q) + 5Q = 700. 

This simplifies to 4Q + 5Q = 700, which is 9Q = 700.

Dividing both sides by 9, we get Q = 700 / 9, which is approximately 77.78. 

However, since the number of bees must be a whole number, we can round down to the nearest whole number. 

Since Q = 77.78, we can round down to Q = 77.

Now that we know Q = 77, we can find B = 2Q = 2 * 77 = 154.

Finally, we can find W = 2B = 2 * 154 = 308.

The final answer is: 308"

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of food items and non-food items separately and then add the tax to the non-food items.

Food items: milk and eggs
Cost of milk = 2 dollars
Cost of eggs = 3 dollars
Total cost of food items = 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Non-food items: light bulbs, cups, and roach traps
Cost of light bulbs = 3 dollars
Cost of cups = 3 dollars
Cost of roach traps = 4 dollars
Total cost of non-food items = 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount.
Tax amount = 10% of 10 dollars = 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of non-food items.
Total cost of non-food items with tax = 10 + 1 = 11 dollars

Now, we add the cost of food items and non-food items with tax to get the total cost.
Total cost = 5 + 11 = 16 dollars

"I think there's been a mistake in the question. It says ""Kim"" has started the business, but then refers to ""Lucas"" in the last sentence. I'll assume it's meant to be ""Kim"" throughout.

To calculate the profit, we first need to determine the total expenses. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. Since Kim has 8 clients (3 current and 5 potential), the total number of bottles of bleach needed is 8 * 2 = 16, and the total number of packs of cloths needed is 8 * 1 = 8.

The cost of bleach is $2 per bottle, so the total cost of bleach is 16 * $2 = $32. The cost of cloths is $5 per pack, so the total cost of cloths is 8 * $5 = $40.

The total expenses are the sum of the cost of bleach and the cost of cloths, which is $32 + $40 = $72.

Since Kim's total income is $92, the profit is the difference between the total income and the total expenses, which is $92 - $72 = $20.

"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we first need to calculate the total number of pineapples in his field. 

Since John has 10 hectares of a pineapple field and there are 100 pineapples per hectare, we multiply the number of hectares by the number of pineapples per hectare:

10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples

Now, we need to find out how many times John can harvest his pineapples within a year. Since he can harvest every 3 months, there are 4 harvests in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests).

To find the total number of pineapples harvested in a year, we multiply the total number of pineapples by the number of harvests:

1. 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.
3. In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as the initial 30 leave the hive, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
4. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left before that but hadn't returned come back. This includes the initial 30 bees that left and the 60 bees that left in the next 6 hours, for a total of 30 + 60 = 90 bees.

However, we are asked to find out how many bees return in the last 6 hours. Since all the bees that left before that hadn't already returned return in the last 6 hours, we need to find out how many bees left before the last 6 hours but hadn't returned yet. 

In the first 6 hours, 30 bees left, and 15 returned in the next 6 hours. So, 30 - 15 = 15 bees left in the first 6 hours but hadn't returned yet. 

In the next 6 hours, 60 bees left, and we don't know how many returned yet. Since we are asked to find out how many bees return in the last 6 hours, we need to find out how many bees left in the next 6 hours but hadn't returned yet. Since all the bees that left before the last 6 hours but hadn't returned return in the last 6 hours, we can assume that all the bees that left in the next 6 hours but hadn't returned yet will also return in the last 6 hours.

So, the total number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is the sum of the bees that left in the first 6 hours but hadn't returned yet and the bees that left in the next 6 hours but hadn't returned yet. 

15 (bees left in the first 6 hours but hadn't returned yet) + 60 (bees left in the next 6 hours but hadn't returned yet) = 75 bees.

"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to first calculate the total cost of the tickets. 

The cost of 1 adult ticket is $12 and the cost of 1 child ticket is $10. 

Total cost = cost of adult ticket + cost of child ticket
Total cost = $12 + $10
Total cost = $22

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, the amount she gave the cashier is the total cost plus the change.

Amount given to the cashier = Total cost + Change
Amount given to the cashier = $22 + $8
Amount given to the cashier = $30

The final answer is: $30"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. 

Let's represent the number of friends Dorothy has as 'x'. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can represent Charlie's friends as 3x. We know that Charlie has 12 friends, so we can set up the equation 3x = 12.

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3. This gives us x = 12 / 3, which simplifies to x = 4. 

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find the number of friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, so we can represent James' friends as 4x. Since we know x = 4, we can substitute this value into the equation to get 4 * 4 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out who will win the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distance from miles to feet for both Steve and Tim. Since 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet, we can convert their distances as follows:

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school:

Steve's time: distance / speed = 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: distance / speed = 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes to get home and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will win the race. To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to subtract the winner's time from the loser's time:

Waiting time = Tim's time - Steve's time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating all the tires. 

First, let's calculate the cost of inflating the bicycle tires. Each bicycle has 2 tires, and there were 5 bicycles. So, the total number of bicycle tires is 5 * 2 = 10. The cost of inflating these tires is 10 * 25 cents = $2.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of inflating the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and there were 3 tricycles. So, the total number of tricycle tires is 3 * 3 = 9. The cost of inflating these tires is 9 * 25 cents = $2.25.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of inflating the unicycle tire. A unicycle has 1 tire, and there was 1 unicycle. So, the total number of unicycle tires is 1 * 1 = 1. The cost of inflating this tire is 1 * 25 cents = $0.25.

Now, let's add up the total cost of inflating all the tires: $2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.00.

The final answer is: $5.00"
"To find out how much change Carl receives, we first need to calculate the total cost of the cookies. 

There are 10 packs of cookies, and each pack has 6 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is 10 * 6 = 60 cookies.

Each cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost of the cookies is 60 * $0.10 = $6.

Carl pays with a $10 bill, so the change he receives is $10 - $6 = $4.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Dave ate 14 french fries initially.
2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   Now, the total amount eaten by Dave and the seagull is 14 + 7 = 21 french fries.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 french fries.
   Now, the total amount eaten is 21 + 9 = 30 french fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries. Let's denote the initial amount of fries as 'x'. 
   After the seagull and pigeons ate, the remaining amount is x - 30.
   The raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is (2/3) * (x - 30).
   The remaining amount after the raccoon is (x - 30) - (2/3) * (x - 30).
   Simplifying this, we get (1/3) * (x - 30).
5. After the raccoon, ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 behind. 
   This means the remaining amount after the raccoon is 5 + 1 = 6 french fries.
   Setting (1/3) * (x - 30) = 6, we can solve for x.
   Multiplying both sides by 3, we get x - 30 = 18.
   Adding 30 to both sides, we get x = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester, we need to calculate the total hours he spends in a week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour. So, the total hours he spends on these days in a week is 3 * 1 = 3 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours. So, the total hours he spends on these days in a week is 2 * 2 = 4 hours.

The total hours Kimo spends in a week is 3 + 4 = 7 hours.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester is 7 * 16 = 112 hours.

The final answer is: 112"
"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of the baguettes from feet to inches, since the lengths of the rolls and croissants are given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so each baguette is 2 * 12 = 24 inches long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches

Now, let's add the lengths together: 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12: 3360 / 12 = 280 feet

"To determine the total number of bananas needed for 2 months, we need to calculate the monthly consumption of all the apes and then multiply it by 2.

The monkeys need 200 bananas per month, the gorillas need 400 bananas per month, and the baboons need 100 bananas per month. 

Total monthly consumption = 200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas per month.

Since the zookeeper needs to order bananas for 2 months, we multiply the total monthly consumption by 2.

Total bananas needed for 2 months = 700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he's running back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. 

To find the total distance Kelly ran, we add the initial 200 yards to the distance she ran to the 40-yard line and back: 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Now, we compare the distances: Blake ran 3000 yards, and Kelly ran 2920 yards. Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

"To find the number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond now, we need to subtract the number of tadpoles that hid under the rock from the number of tadpoles that came out from under the lily pad.

Initially, Finn saw 11 tadpoles. 

6 tadpoles came out from under the lily pad, so now there are 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles.

Then, 2 tadpoles hid under the rock, so we need to subtract 2 from 17. 

17 - 2 = 15

So, Finn can see 15 tadpoles in the pond now.

"To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin, we need to add the number of starfish, sea horses, and clownfish he caught. 

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 

Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Now, let's find the number of fish caught by Locsin. 

Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.

Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.

Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Now, let's find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin.

Total fish caught = Total fish caught by Anakin + Total fish caught by Locsin
= 19 + 13

"To determine how many times Sandra has to babysit, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she needs for the Spanish flans and divide it by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs needed for 15 Spanish flans. Since each flan requires 3 eggs, we multiply 15 by 3:

15 * 3 = 45 eggs

Now, we know Sandra gets 9 eggs per babysitting job. To find out how many times she needs to babysit, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job:

45 eggs / 9 eggs per babysitting job = 5 babysitting jobs

So, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to get enough eggs for 15 Spanish flans.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write an equation:

S = 2B

In 2 years, their ages will be B + 2 and S + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write another equation:

(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28

Substituting S = 2B into the second equation, we get:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

1. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red.
2. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four.
3. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, and Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.

From point 3, we know Sally Four is 8 years old. 

From point 2, we can calculate Granny Red's age: 
Granny Red's age = 2 * Sally Four's age
Granny Red's age = 2 * 8
Granny Red's age = 16

From point 1, we can calculate Sally Two's age: 
Sally Two's age = Granny Red's age + 3
Sally Two's age = 16 + 3
Sally Two's age = 19

Now, we know the ages of Sally Four, Sally Two, and Granny Red. We still need to find the age of the fourth bird, but there's no information about the fourth bird's age. However, the question asks for the total age of the four birds. Since we have three of the four birds' ages, we can calculate the total age of the three birds we know and assume the fourth bird's age is unknown for now.

Total age of the three birds = Sally Four's age + Sally Two's age + Granny Red's age
Total age of the three birds = 8 + 19 + 16
Total age of the three birds = 43

Since we don't have information about the fourth bird's age, we can't calculate the total age of all four birds. However, the question might be asking for the total age of the three birds we know, or it might be asking for the total age of all four birds, which we can't determine with the given information.

To provide a response, I'll assume the question is asking for the total age of the three birds we know.

"To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we first need to calculate the increased minimum payments for each debt. 

The minimum payment for the student loans is $300, so 50% more than that would be 300 + (300 * 0.5) = 300 + 150 = $450.

The minimum payment for the credit card is $200, so 50% more than that would be 200 + (200 * 0.5) = 200 + 100 = $300.

The minimum payment for the mortgage is $500, so 50% more than that would be 500 + (500 * 0.5) = 500 + 250 = $750.

Now, we need to add up the increased minimum payments for each debt to find the total monthly payment. 

Total monthly payment = $450 (student loans) + $300 (credit card) + $750 (mortgage) = $1500.

To find the total payment in a year, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12.

Total yearly payment = $1500 * 12 = $18,000.

Total time to cut all potatoes: 60 potatoes * (5/60) minutes/potato = 5 minutes

Adding both times together: 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's find out how much they make per gallon. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so they make 20 * $0.50 = $10 per gallon.

Their profit is $25, and they make $10 per gallon. To find out how many gallons they made, we divide the profit by the profit per gallon: $25 / $10 = 2.5 gallons.

Now, let's find out how much they spent on lemons and sugar per gallon. They spend $3 on lemons and $2 on sugar, so they spend $3 + $2 = $5 per gallon.

Since they made 2.5 gallons, they spent 2.5 * $5 = $12.50 on lemons and sugar.

However, we are only asked about the lemons. To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to know the ratio of lemons to lemons and sugar. Since they spend $3 on lemons and $2 on sugar, the ratio of lemons to lemons and sugar is 3:5.

The total amount they spent on lemons and sugar is $12.50, and the ratio of lemons is 3/8 (3 out of 3+5 = 8). So, the amount they spent on lemons is (3/8) * $12.50 = $4.69.

The final answer is: $4.69"
"To find the number of Chinese participants, we first need to subtract the number of Japanese participants from the total number of participants. 

Total participants = 240
Japanese participants = 80
Chinese participants = Total participants - Japanese participants
Chinese participants = 240 - 80
Chinese participants = 160

Now, we know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of girls on the Chinese team = Chinese participants - Number of boys
Number of girls on the Chinese team = 160 - 60
Number of girls on the Chinese team = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how much money Zaid has left after all these expenses and donations, we need to follow the order of operations.

First, let's calculate the amount Zaid spends on rent: 1/4 of 6000 is 600.

Next, let's calculate the amount Zaid spends on car fuel: 1/3 of 6000 is 2000.

Now, let's subtract the rent and car fuel expenses from Zaid's monthly income: 6000 - 600 - 2000 = 4400.

Since Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity, we need to find half of 4400: 4400 / 2 = 2200.

Now, let's subtract the donation from the remaining amount: 4400 - 2200 = 2200.

Zaid gives his daughter 200 and his wife 700, so let's subtract these amounts from the remaining amount: 2200 - 200 - 700 = 1300.

Therefore, Zaid will have 1300 dollars left after all these expenses and donations.

The final answer is: $1300"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Bo has 40 crabs.
- Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.
- Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

To find the total number of crabs the three have together, we add the number of crabs each one has: 40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122.

The final answer is: 122"
"To find out how much Lloyd earned in the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd tutored 5 hours at $10 per hour, so his earnings for the first week are:
5 hours * $10/hour = $50

For the second week, Lloyd tutored 8 hours at $10 per hour, so his earnings for the second week are:
8 hours * $10/hour = $80

Now, let's add his earnings for both weeks:
$50 (first week) + $80 (second week) = $130

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the number of votes the loser got, we first need to find the total number of votes the winner got. Since the winner got 3/4 of the votes, we can calculate this by multiplying 3/4 by the total number of students who voted, which is 80.

3/4 * 80 = 60

This means the winner got 60 votes. To find the number of votes the loser got, we subtract the number of votes the winner got from the total number of students who voted.

80 - 60 = 20

The loser got 20 votes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses is 4x.

We are also given that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations. So, the number of pink calla lilies is 5x.

We know that the total number of flowers ordered is the sum of red roses, white carnations, and pink calla lilies. However, we are not given the total number of flowers. But we are given that Sandra has threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm, which implies that the missing red roses are the only ones that need to be delivered.

Since we don't have any information about the total number of flowers, we can assume that the missing red roses are the only ones that are missing. This means that the number of missing red roses is equal to the number of red roses that were not delivered.

Let's denote the number of missing red roses as 'm'. We know that the number of red roses is 4x, so the number of missing red roses is m = 4x - (number of red roses delivered).

However, we are not given the number of red roses delivered. But we can express the number of red roses delivered as 4x - m.

Since we don't have any information about the number of red roses delivered, we can assume that the number of red roses delivered is equal to the number of red roses that were ordered. This is a reasonable assumption because if the number of red roses delivered is less than the number of red roses ordered, Sandra would have already switched suppliers.

So, the number of red roses delivered is 4x.

Now, we can set up an equation to find the value of x. We know that the number of missing red roses is equal to the number of red roses that were not delivered, which is 4x - 4x = m.

However, this equation is not useful because it doesn't give us any information about the value of x. We need to use the information that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is 5x, and we also know that the number of white carnations is x.

Since the number of pink calla lilies is 5x, we can set up an equation: 5x = 200 (the number of pink calla lilies).

Now we can solve for x: x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the value of x, we can find the number of red roses: 4x = 4 * 40
4x = 160

The final answer is: 160"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

Let's denote Mark's current age as M and Jean's current age as J. We know that Jean is two years older than Mark, so we can write an equation:

J = M + 2

We are also given that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Two years ago, Mark's age would be M - 2, and Jan's age would be 30 - 2 = 28. We can write an equation based on this information:

M - 2 = (1/2) * 28 + 5

Simplifying the equation:

M - 2 = 14 + 5
M - 2 = 19
M = 21

Now that we know Mark's age, we can find Jean's age using the first equation:

J = M + 2
J = 21 + 2
J = 23

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time for each team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them up.

The well-rounded team's total time is 4 x 55 seconds = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner runs 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's total time is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, and then find the difference between these two probabilities.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is the probability of rolling a 4, 5, or 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5, since there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25 or 25%.

Now, we need to find the difference between these two probabilities. The difference is 50% - 25% = 25%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To find out how many apples Jenna picked, we need to determine half of the number of apples her mom picked. Since her mom picked 20 apples, we can calculate Jenna's share by dividing 20 by 2.

20 / 2 = 10

Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom picked 20, Jenna picked 10 apples. To find the total number of apples they both picked, we need to add Jenna's share to her mom's share.

20 (mom's apples) + 10 (Jenna's apples) = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of small rodents (rats and hamsters) and the total number of straw pieces given to them. 

Let's start by finding the total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters. Since there are 10 cages of hamsters and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw, the total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

Now, we know that the total number of straw pieces distributed among the small rodents is 160. Since 50 pieces are given to the hamsters, the remaining straw pieces given to the rats are 160 - 50 = 110.

We also know that the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Let's assume the number of rats in each cage is 'r'. Then, the total number of rats in all cages is 3r.

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, the total number of straw pieces given to the rats is 6 * 3r = 18r.

We know that the total number of straw pieces given to the rats is 110. So, we can set up the equation 18r = 110.

To find the value of 'r', we can divide both sides of the equation by 18: r = 110 / 18.

r = 6.11 (approximately)

However, since the number of rats cannot be a fraction, we need to find the smallest whole number that satisfies the equation. 

We can try different values of 'r' to find the smallest whole number that satisfies the equation. 

Let's try r = 6: 18 * 6 = 108 (less than 110)

Let's try r = 7: 18 * 7 = 126 (greater than 110)

"To calculate the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months and add it to the initial amount.

The monthly interest rate is 2%, which as a decimal is 0.02. 

The interest for the first month is $100 * 0.02 = $2.
The interest for the second month is $102 * 0.02 = $2.04.
The interest for the third month is $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808.

Now, let's add the interest for all three months to the initial amount:
$100 + $2 + $2.04 + $2.0808 = $106.1208.

So, Mandy should pay $106.12 to Benedict.

"To find the number of bags the trader sold, we need to first calculate the total cost and total revenue. 

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The total cost of buying the bags is $20x (since each bag costs $20).
The total cost of transporting the bags is $2x (since each bag costs $2 to transport).
The total cost is the sum of the buying cost and the transportation cost: $20x + $2x = $22x.

The total revenue from selling the bags is $30x (since each bag is sold at $30).

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: $30x - $22x = $8x.

We are given that the profit is $400, so we can set up the equation: $8x = $400.

To find the number of bags, we can divide both sides of the equation by $8: x = $400 / $8.

x = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide it by 3.

First, let's find the cost of the food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. Since they spent $20.25 on tickets, the cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

The cost of the rides is 2 rides * $33 per ride = $66.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3: $102 / 3 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"To find out how many peaches John collects, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he collects peaches and then multiply it by the number of peaches he collects per minute.

Since John collects peaches for 3 hours, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, we know John collects 2 peaches per minute. To find the total number of peaches, we multiply the total minutes by the peaches collected per minute:

180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

So, John collects 360 peaches.

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ducks needs per day, we first need to calculate the total pounds of insects they need per week. Since there are ten ducks and each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, we multiply the number of ducks by the pounds of insects each duck needs per week.

10 ducks * 3.5 pounds/duck/week = 35 pounds/week

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of insects they need per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total pounds of insects needed per week by 7.

35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

So, the flock of ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day. 

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of trees Tom has left, we need to calculate the net change in the number of trees over 10 years.

Initially, Tom has 50 trees.

Each year, he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, resulting in a net gain of 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year.

Over 10 years, the net gain would be 8 * 10 = 80 trees.

So, the total number of trees after 10 years would be 50 (initial trees) + 80 (net gain) = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we multiply 130 by 0.3: 130 * 0.3 = 39 trees.

Now, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees: 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

The final answer is: 91"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos on Sue's front yard.

On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out on Sue's front yard. So, now there are 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. Now, there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos.

The total number of flamingos on Sue's front yard is 30 pink + 6 white = 36 flamingos.

To find out how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how much change Violetta will get, we first need to determine how many crayons she can buy with $20. Since one crayon costs $2, we can divide the total amount she has by the cost of one crayon.

$20 Ã· $2 = 10 crayons

Since Violetta needs 5 different colors, we can assume she will buy 2 crayons of each color (although the problem doesn't specify this, it's a reasonable assumption). 

The total number of crayons she will buy is 5 colors * 2 crayons per color = 10 crayons

Since she can buy 10 crayons with $20 and she actually buys 10 crayons, the total cost will be 10 crayons * $2 per crayon = $20

The change she will get is $0, as the total cost of the crayons is equal to the amount she has."
"To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser, since a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. 

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens. 

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total pounds of carrots that will be used by the restaurants. 

Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. 

Total pounds of carrots used = Number of restaurants * Pounds per restaurant
Total pounds of carrots used = 40 * 2
Total pounds of carrots used = 80 pounds

Now, we subtract the total pounds of carrots used from the total pounds of carrots available to find out how many pounds will not be used.

Pounds of carrots not used = Total pounds of carrots - Total pounds of carrots used
Pounds of carrots not used = 200 - 80
Pounds of carrots not used = 120

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Elaine had 20 PokÃ©mon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times the number of cards she initially had: 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month: 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of PokÃ©mon cards she collected in the first and second months: (60 + 40) * 2 = 200 cards.

To find the total number of cards Elaine has now, we need to add the cards she had initially to the cards she collected in each month: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320.

"Let's break down the information given. Mark edits 1000 sentences each week, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, he also edits 1000 sentences for Publisher B.

We know that Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 2 * 5 cents = 10 cents per sentence.

Mark's total earnings from Publisher A would be 1000 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 5000 cents.

Since Mark earns twice as much from Publisher B, his total earnings from Publisher B would be 2 * 5000 cents = 10000 cents.

Mark's total weekly earnings would be the sum of his earnings from both publishers: 5000 cents + 10000 cents = 15000 cents.

The final answer is: 15000"
"To find the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the total number of pails he gets in a day and then multiply it by the amount of water in each pail.

Baldur gets 5 pails of water every morning and 6 pails of water every afternoon. So, the total number of pails he gets in a day is 5 + 6 = 11 pails.

Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, the total amount of water he gets every day is 11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters.

The final answer is: 55"
"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider both the one-time monetary reward and the 5% raise in salary.

First, let's calculate the total amount John earns from his weekly salary for the year. Since he makes $2000 a week and works every week of the year, we multiply his weekly salary by the number of weeks in a year (52).

Weekly salary: $2000
Number of weeks in a year: 52
Total salary for the year: $2000 * 52 = $104,000

Now, let's calculate the 5% raise in salary. A 5% raise means John's new salary will be 105% of his original salary (100% + 5% increase).

Original salary: $2000
New salary: $2000 * 1.05 = $2100

Since John got the award on the first day of the year, he will earn the new salary for all 52 weeks of the year. 

New weekly salary: $2100
Total salary for the year: $2100 * 52 = $109,200

Now, let's add the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to his total salary for the year.

Total earnings for the year: $109,200 + $5000 = $114,200

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for the sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish separately and then add them together.

For the sandwiches, Carl ate 7 days' worth of sandwiches (since he ate one every day for a week) with 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. So, the total slices used for sandwiches = 7 * 2 = 14.

For the omelets, Carl ate 3 days' worth of omelets with one more slice per omelet than per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. So, the total slices used for omelets = 3 * 3 = 9.

For the macaroni and cheese dish, Carl used 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish together: 14 (sandwiches) + 9 (omelets) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31.

"To find out how many pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the total number of pens she initially had and then add the number of pens she bought.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so the total number of pens she had initially is 22 + 10 = 32.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag, so the total number of blue pens she bought is 6 * 9 = 54.

She also bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag, so the total number of red pens she bought is 2 * 6 = 12.

Now, let's add the number of pens she bought to the number of pens she initially had: 32 (initial pens) + 54 (blue pens) + 12 (red pens) = 98.

However, we also need to consider the green and yellow pens she initially had. We already added the pens she bought, but we didn't add the initial green and yellow pens to the total number of pens she bought. Since she bought no green or yellow pens, we don't need to add anything to the total.

So, the total number of pens Janet has now is 98.

The final answer is: 98"
"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to find the total score she needs for the semester. Since there are six tests and she wants an average of 93, we multiply the desired average by the number of tests: 93 * 6 = 558.

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score among the five she has so far. The scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The lowest score is 71.

Now, we add up the remaining four scores: 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367. 

To find the total score she needs, we add the lowest score to the sum of the remaining scores: 367 + 71 = 438.

Now, we subtract the total score she has so far from the total score she needs: 558 - 438 = 120.

So, Brinley needs a score of 120 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

"To find the total number of kilometers Michael rode his bike, we need to calculate the total kilometers for the two different periods.

First, let's calculate the total kilometers for the first four weeks when he rode 25 kilometers each time, 5 times a week. 

Total kilometers in the first four weeks = 25 km * 5 times/week * 4 weeks = 25 * 5 * 4 = 500 km

Next, let's calculate the total kilometers for the next three weeks when he rode 60 kilometers each time, 2 times a week.

Total kilometers in the next three weeks = 60 km * 2 times/week * 3 weeks = 60 * 2 * 3 = 360 km

Now, let's add the total kilometers from both periods to find the overall total.

Total kilometers = 500 km + 360 km = 860 km

"To find the total weight of the bag of candy, we first need to find the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately, and then add them together.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Each candied apple weighs half as much as each chocolate bar, so each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

The total weight of the bag of candy is the sum of the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, half a dozen plates will cost 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

We are also given that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since twenty dozen cups is equal to 240 cups, we can find the cost of each cup by dividing the total cost by the number of cups. 

Cost per cup = Total cost of cups / Number of cups
Cost per cup = $34,800 / 240
Cost per cup = $144

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy and the total amount of money she has earned so far. 

The total cost of the items is the cost of the jacket plus the cost of 2 pairs of shoes: 
$30 (jacket) + 2 * $20 (shoes) = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved before she started babysitting. She earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, so the total amount she has earned from babysitting is 4 * $5 = $20. 

The total amount of money Sara has is the sum of the money she already had and the money she earned from babysitting: 
$10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting earnings) = $30.

To find out how much more money Sara needs, we subtract the total amount she has from the total cost of the items: 
$70 (total cost) - $30 (total amount she has) = $40.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she must mow the lawn to earn the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by the amount she earns from mowing the lawn: 
$40 (remaining amount) / $4 (mowing earnings) = 10.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that w = r + 2.

The total number of eggs collected is the sum of the eggs produced by red and white chickens. Since each red chicken produces 3 eggs and each white chicken produces 5 eggs, we can write the equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

The number of red chickens is 4.

"To find the time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park since he walks around the edge. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the dimensions of the park, l = 6 miles and w = 1.5 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the perimeter by his speed:

Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"Let's break down the information given. 

On the first day, Sloane counts 100 customers. 
On the second day, she counts 50 more customers than the first day, so she counts 100 + 50 = 150 customers. 
The total number of customers by the third day is 500. 

To find the number of customers on the third day, we need to subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day. 

Total customers on the first two days = 100 + 150 = 250 
Customers on the third day = 500 - 250 = 250

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, the rate of water loss for both pools is the same. 

The difference in the amount of water between the big and small pool is 2x - x = x gallons. 

Since the rate of water loss is the same for both pools, the difference in the amount of water between the big and small pool remains constant over time. 

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as 'y' gallons. Then, the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y gallons.

The difference in the amount of water between the big and small pool is still x gallons. Since the rate of water loss is the same for both pools, the time it took for the big pool to have four times as much water as the small pool is the same as the time it took for the big pool to lose x gallons of water.

Since the rate of water loss is 4 gallons/minute, the time it took for the big pool to lose x gallons of water is x/4 minutes.

The time it took for the big pool to have four times as much water as the small pool is 4 minutes (as given in the problem). 

Since the time it took for the big pool to lose x gallons of water is x/4 minutes, we can set up the equation x/4 = 4.

Solving for x, we get x = 16.

Now, we know that the initial amount of water in the small pool is 16 gallons. Since the rate of water loss is 4 gallons/minute, the amount of water lost by the small pool in 4 minutes is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

The current amount of water in the small pool is the initial amount minus the amount lost, which is 16 - 16 = 0 gallons.

Total cost = $352.00

Since Lori earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total cost by her hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work.

Hours worked = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours worked = $352.00 / $8.00
Hours worked = 44 hours

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. The additional amount is 10% of $2000, which is:
$2000 * 0.10 = $200

So, the total amount Janeth needs to pay is $2000 (initial amount) + $200 (additional amount) = $2200

Since Janeth pays $1980 in 12 months, the remaining balance will be:
$2200 (total amount) - $1980 (paid amount) = $220

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age is 3 * 21 = 63 years old.

Now, we have the current ages of the three: Harriet (21), Zack (42), and Adrian (63). 

In three years, their ages will be: Harriet (21 + 3 = 24), Zack (42 + 3 = 45), and Adrian (63 + 3 = 66).

Naomi scored 68 points. 
Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. 
Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 
Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. 
Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi (68), Yuri (44), and Brianna (85). 
We can find the points scored by Jojo by subtracting the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points scored by the four students. 
Total points scored by the four students = 251 points. 
Points scored by Jojo = Total points - (points scored by Naomi + points scored by Yuri + points scored by Brianna)

After losing 8 water type, he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards.

After buying 14 grass type, he has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.

The total number of cards James has now is 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 cards.

The probability of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, which is 32/96.

To find the percentage, we multiply by 100: (32/96) * 100 = 33.333...

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is 33."
"To find out how much Chad still owes, we need to calculate the total cost of his meal and then subtract the gift card amount.

The base burrito costs $6.50. 
He adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each, which is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50. 
So, the total cost of the add-ons is $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50.
The total cost of the meal before the upgrade is $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00.
He upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, so the new total is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.
He has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract this from the total: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To find the total number of pieces Kalinda and her mom can place per minute, we need to determine how many pieces her mom can place per minute. Since her mom can place half as many pieces as Kalinda, and Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute, her mom can place 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

The total number of pieces they can place per minute is 4 (Kalinda) + 2 (her mom) = 6 pieces per minute.

To find the total time it will take to complete the puzzle, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place per minute. 

360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time from minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Therefore, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find out how many melons were ready for harvest after two months, we need to calculate 30% of 120. 

30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36

So, 36 melons were ready for harvest after two months. This leaves 120 - 36 = 84 melons remaining.

After two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining 84 melons were ready for harvest. 

3/4 of 84 = (3/4) * 84 = 63

So, 63 melons were ready for harvest after two weeks. This leaves 84 - 63 = 21 melons not ready to be harvested.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the total cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees.

The total cost of the cars is 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.

The tax on the cars is 10% of $240,000, which is 0.1 * $240,000 = $24,000.

The registration fees for the cars are 12 * $1000 = $12,000.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

The final answer is: $276,000."
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. To find out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we need to multiply the number of shells she collected on Monday by 2.

So, 25 * 2 = 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total number of insects in the garden, we first need to determine the number of bugs. Since Dax found half as many bugs as ants, and there were 50 ants, we can calculate the number of bugs as follows:

Number of bugs = Number of ants / 2
Number of bugs = 50 / 2
Number of bugs = 25

Now, to find the total number of insects in the garden, we add the number of ants and bugs together:

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
Total number of insects = 50 + 25
Total number of insects = 75

The final answer is: 75"
"To find out how many penguins are left sunbathing, we need to calculate the number of penguins that jumped in the ocean and the number that went inside the cave, and then subtract that from the total number of penguins.

One-third of the penguins jumped in the ocean, which is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins.

Another one-third of the penguins went inside the cave, which is also 36 / 3 = 12 penguins.

So, in total, 12 + 12 = 24 penguins left the sunbathing area.

To find out how many penguins are left sunbathing, we subtract the number of penguins that left from the total number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many vines Steve needs, we first need to determine how many tomatoes he eats per week. Since Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, we multiply this by 7 to get the total tomatoes he eats per week.

6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we can assume his girlfriend eats half the amount he does. So, his girlfriend eats 6 / 2 = 3 tomatoes per day. 

3 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 21 tomatoes/week

The total number of tomatoes they both eat per week is 42 (Steve) + 21 (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes/week.

Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines they need, we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by the number of tomatoes per vine.

63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines

So, Steve and his girlfriend need 21 vines to produce enough tomatoes for their weekly consumption. 

The final answer is: 21"

First, let's find the total number of slices needed: 
20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices

Since pizzas are sold in 8 slices, we need to divide the total number of slices by 8 to find the number of pizzas:
80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas

So, John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Ram starts with 25 pens. He uses 5 pens to make 1 new pen, so he gets 1 new pen. Now, he has 25 - 5 = 20 pens left. 

He uses 5 of the remaining 20 pens to make 1 new pen, so he gets 1 new pen. Now, he has 20 - 5 = 15 pens left.

He continues this process until he has used up all the pens. 

After the first round, he has 20 pens left.
After the second round, he has 15 pens left.
After the third round, he has 10 pens left.
After the fourth round, he has 5 pens left.
After the fifth round, he has 0 pens left.

Now, let's count the total number of pens he gets: 
1 (from the first round) + 1 (from the second round) + 1 (from the third round) + 1 (from the fourth round) + 1 (from the fifth round) = 5

So, Ram gets 5 new pens in total.

"To find out how much money Johnny had after a year, we need to follow the steps he took.

First, Johnny started with his allowance of $20 and added an extra $10 to it. So, his total amount of money is $20 + $10 = $30.

Next, he invested this sum of money, which tripled in a year. This means that his $30 was multiplied by 3. 

So, the amount of money he had after a year is $30 * 3 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we need to determine the ages of Mary and Joan first.

Since Jessa is 20 years old, and Joan is five years older than Jessa, we can calculate Joan's age by adding 5 to Jessa's age: 20 + 5 = 25.

Now, we know that Mary is two years younger than Joan, so we can calculate Mary's age by subtracting 2 from Joan's age: 25 - 2 = 23.

Now that we have the ages of all three girls, we can find the sum of their ages by adding their individual ages together: 20 (Jessa) + 23 (Mary) + 25 (Joan) = 68.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we first need to find the number of students who went out through exit A and exit B.

Initially, there were 1000 students. 30% of them went out through exit A. 

30% of 1000 = 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students went out through exit A.

Now, the remaining students are 1000 - 300 = 700.

3/5 of the remaining 700 students went out through exit B.

3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students went out through exit B.

Now, the remaining students are 700 - 420 = 280.

The rest of the students went out through exit C, which is 280.

"Let's break down the information given. We know that John has 54 candies and he has twice as many candies as Robert. So, we can find the number of candies Robert has by dividing John's candies by 2.

Robert's candies = John's candies / 2
Robert's candies = 54 / 2
Robert's candies = 27

We also know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, we can find the number of candies James has by adding 6 to Robert's candies.

James' candies = Robert's candies + 6
James' candies = 27 + 6
James' candies = 33

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. We can do this by subtracting James' candies from John's candies.

Difference = John's candies - James' candies
Difference = 54 - 33
Difference = 21

The final answer is: 21"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Dolly has 2 books and Pandora has 1 book. 

Dolly will read her own 2 books and Pandora's 1 book, so Dolly will read a total of 3 books.

Pandora will read her own 1 book and Dolly's 2 books, so Pandora will read a total of 3 books.

In total, they will read 3 (Dolly's total) + 3 (Pandora's total) = 6 books.

However, we need to consider that they also read each other's books. So, Dolly will read Pandora's book and Pandora will read Dolly's book. This means they will read 2 more books.

Therefore, the total number of books they will read is 6 (initial books) + 2 (each other's books) = 8 books.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we first need to determine how many letters he writes and responds to each week.

Initially, Mike had 5 pen pals. He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, so he has 5 - 2 = 3 pen pals left.

Each of his pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and he responds to each letter. So, the total number of letters he receives and responds to is 3 * 2 * 2 = 12 letters.

Since each letter is 5 pages long, and he responds in kind, the total number of pages he writes is 12 * 5 = 60 pages.

Given that he can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 60 pages * 6 minutes/page = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 360 minutes / 60 = 6 hours.

Therefore, Mike spends 6 hours writing a week. 

6"
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to calculate the total minutes he used for his daily calls and the extra minutes, then subtract that from his total plan minutes.

First, let's calculate the total minutes Jason used for his daily calls. He has a 15-minute call with his boss every day for 30 days, so:

15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

He also had 300 extra minutes of calls this month. 

Now, let's add the minutes used for daily calls and the extra minutes:

450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Now, let's subtract the total minutes used from his total plan minutes:

1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

So, Jason has 250 minutes left.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Griffin had 24 fries. 

Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. So, Griffin was left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Ginger gave Griffin some fries, and then Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. 

After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin was left with 9 - 2 = 7 fries.

However, we know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. This means that Ginger gave Griffin 27 - 7 = 20 fries.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2(2x)

Now, let's solve for x:

28 = 4x

Divide both sides by 4:

7 = x

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total amount Jean paid, we first need to calculate the total hours worked and the total cost before the discount.

The makeup artist works 6 hours a day, 4 times a week, for 5 weeks. So, the total hours worked is 6 * 4 * 5 = 120 hours.

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total cost before the discount is 120 * $250 = $30,000.

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 0.10: $30,000 * 0.10 = $3,000.

The amount Jean paid is the total cost minus the discount: $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

The final answer is: $27,000."
"To find out how much each person paid, we first need to calculate the total cost of the party supplies. 

Total cost = cost of ingredients + cost of presents + cost of decorations + cost of invitations + cost of goodie bags
Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are 3 people in total.

$96 / 3 = $32

Each person paid $32."
"To find out how much the chef spent, we need to calculate the total weight of the onions and then multiply it by the cost per pound.

The chef bought 4 bags of onions, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. So, the total weight of the onions is:
4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

Since a pound of onions costs $1.50, the total cost is:
200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

The chef spent $300."
"Let's break down the information given. 

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 5 cookies, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 13 cookies, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

To find the total number of cookies Sue ate, we add the cookies she ate on Monday and Tuesday: 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.

Her sister ate a total of 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories, and her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

The difference in calories consumed is 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories.

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the school. 

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60.

The total number of girls in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

We already know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

To find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the total number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls in the school: 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the total number of boys in the school is also 30. 

The total number of boys in the first two classes is 60 - 27 = 33 (since there are 60 students in total and 27 are girls). 

To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the total number of boys in the first two classes from the total number of boys in the school: 30 - 33 is incorrect, we need to find the number of boys in the first two classes. The total number of students in the first two classes is 20 + 20 = 40. The number of girls in the first two classes is 27. So the number of boys in the first two classes is 40 - 27 = 13. 

Now we can find the number of boys in the third class: 30 - 13 = 17.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. 

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's represent the number of cougars killed today as 'x'. Then, the number of wolves killed today is 3x.

We also know that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, the number of cougars killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since we know the number of cougars killed today is 12, we can set up the equation 3x = 12 to find the number of wolves killed today. Solving for x, we get x = 4.

Now that we know x, we can find the number of wolves killed today by multiplying 3 and x, which is 3 * 4 = 12.

To find the total number of animals killed, we add the number of animals killed last night and today. The total number of wolves killed is 10 + 12 = 22. The total number of cougars killed is 15 + 12 = 27.

The total number of animals killed is 22 + 27 = 49.

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we first need to determine how many times Anne went down the slide. 

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we need to calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30. 

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 

So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. 

To find out how many times Robert went down the slide, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4. 

21 * 4 = 84.

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

"To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we first need to determine how many cows Mr. Sylas added to each stall. 

Initially, each stall had 20 cows. Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and divided them equally among the 10 stalls. 

To find out how many cows he added to each stall, we divide the total number of cows bought (40) by the number of stalls (10). 

40 / 10 = 4

So, Mr. Sylas added 4 cows to each stall. 

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. We know that each stall has 20 (initial cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows.

To find out how many cows are in 8 stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8.

"To find the total weight of the redwood tree, we first need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections. 

The redwood is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get the total number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Since each section weighs 400 pounds, we multiply the number of sections by the weight per section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

Now, we need to find 30% of the total weight that the termites ate. To do this, we multiply the total weight by 0.3 (which is 30%): 8000 * 0.3 = 2400 pounds.

"To determine the total amount of flour needed, we need to calculate the amount needed for each day and then add them together.

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many cups are needed for 36 cookies. 

First, let's find out how many dozens are in 36 cookies: 36 / 12 = 3. So, Carla needs 3 dozen cookies. 

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 1 dozen cookies, Carla will need 3 * 2 = 6 cups of flour for today.

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. Again, we need to find out how many dozens are in 30 cookies: 30 / 12 = 2.5. Since we can't have half a dozen, we need to calculate the flour needed for 2 dozen and half a dozen separately.

For 2 dozen cookies, Carla will need 2 * 2 = 4 cups of flour. For half a dozen cookies, Carla will need 1 cup of flour (since 1 cup is needed for 6 cookies and half a dozen is 6 cookies). 

So, for tomorrow, Carla will need 4 + 1 = 5 cups of flour.

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

The total price of the house is the sum of the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

To find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price: $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

The final answer is: $9,500"
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid in fees and subtract that from the selling price, then subtract the remaining loan amount.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 is 0.03 x $400,000 = $12,000.

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 is 0.05 x $400,000 = $20,000.

The total amount paid in fees is $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

Now, let's subtract the total fees from the selling price: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000.

Finally, let's subtract the remaining loan amount: $368,000 - $250,000 = $118,000.

Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000."
"To find the total time, we first need to determine the time it takes to heat the oil to 400 degrees. 

It takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees. Since it takes 40% longer to heat it up to 400 degrees, we need to find 40% of 20 minutes and add it to 20 minutes. 

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. 

So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat the oil to 400 degrees.

After warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. Since it took 28 minutes to warm up the oil, it will take 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 28 minutes (to warm the oil) + 23 minutes (to cook) = 51 minutes.

The final answer is: 51"
"To find the total amount spent on newspaper ads, we multiply the cost of each newspaper ad by the number of newspaper ads: $5 * 50 = $250.

To find the total amount spent on television ads, we multiply the cost of each television ad by the number of television ads: $75 * 15 = $1125.

Now, we add the total amount spent on newspaper ads and television ads to find the total amount spent on all ads: $250 + $1125 = $1375.

The final answer is: $1375"
"To find the number of blue golf balls, we first need to determine the total number of golf balls. Since half of the balls are golf balls, and the juggler can juggle 16 balls, the number of golf balls is 16 / 2 = 8.

Now, we know that half of the golf balls are blue. So, the number of blue golf balls is 8 / 2 = 4.

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and add them up.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add up the number of M&Ms in each bag: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

The total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762.

762"
"To find the total number of windows, we need to calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows in each house.

Each house has 3 bedrooms with 2 windows each, so the total number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is 3 * 2 = 6. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 6 * 2 = 12.

Each house has 4 additional windows not connected to bedrooms. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is 4 * 2 = 8.

The total number of windows in one house is 12 (from bedrooms) + 8 (additional) = 20. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows is 20 * 2 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"

Change = Amount paid - Total cost
Change = $20 - $14.00
Change = $6.00

The final answer is: $6.00"
"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we first need to determine the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette. 

The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is a 1800-stitch project, the total number of stitches used for the body and the sleeves is 1800 - 270 = 1530 stitches.

The body takes 900 stitches, so the sleeves take 1530 - 900 = 630 stitches in total.

Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

The final answer is: 315"
"To find the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan spent on seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately and then add them together.

The cost of the tomato seeds is 20 packets * $40 per packet = $800.

The total cost of the seeds is $800 + $2400 = $3200.

The final numerical answer is: $3200"
"To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the total number of lines for each scene and the song, and then add them up.

The solo song has 54 lines. 

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines to memorize from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has (4/5) * 60 = 48 lines to memorize from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

The final answer is: 138"
"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to first find the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C, and then subtract that from the total number of cards.

First, we find the number of cards with the letter A: 2/5 of 80 is (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards.

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B. The remaining cards after A are 80 - 32 = 48. 1/2 of 48 is (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards.

Now, we find the number of cards with the letter C. The remaining cards after B are 48 - 24 = 24. 5/8 of 24 is (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards.

Now, we add the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C: 32 + 24 + 15 = 71 cards.

Finally, we subtract the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C from the total number of cards to find the number of cards with the letter D: 80 - 71 = 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

Time to dig 30 small holes: 30 holes * 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes
Time to dig 15 large holes: 15 holes * 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes

Total time in minutes: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

So, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we first need to determine their current ages. Since the sum of their ages is 20, we can represent their ages as x and 20 - x.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be x + 10 and Marco's age will be (20 - x) + 10.

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (x + 10) + ((20 - x) + 10). 

Simplifying the expression, we get (x + 10) + (20 - x + 10) = 20 + 20 = 40.

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S.

From the first statement, we know that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so we can write an equation:

R = 6S

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9, and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the second statement, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write another equation:

R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now, let's simplify the second equation:

R + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:

R = 3S + 18

Now we have two equations:

R = 6S
R = 3S + 18

Since both equations are equal to R, we can set them equal to each other:

6S = 3S + 18

Subtract 3S from both sides:

3S = 18

Divide both sides by 3:

S = 6

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total amount Peter paid, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars separately and then add them together.

The cost of the popsicles is 20 * $0.25 = $5.
The cost of the ice cream bars is 4 * $0.50 = $2.

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars together: $5 + $2 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To find the total number of spots on the cobras, we need to multiply the number of cobras by the number of spots each cobra has. 

Number of cobras: 40
Number of spots per cobra: 70
Total spots on cobras: 40 * 70 = 2800

Since the cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can find the number of spots on a mamba by dividing the number of spots on a cobra by 2.

Number of spots per mamba: 70 / 2 = 35

Now, we can find the total number of spots on the mambas by multiplying the number of mambas by the number of spots each mamba has.

Number of mambas: 60
Number of spots per mamba: 35
Total spots on mambas: 60 * 35 = 2100

To find the total number of spots on all the snakes, we add the total spots on the cobras and the mambas.

Total spots on all snakes: 2800 + 2100 = 4900

Finally, to find half the number of spots they all have combined, we divide the total number of spots by 2.

Half the total spots: 4900 / 2 = 2450"
"To find out how many pizzas Maddy needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of people she needs to serve. 

There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of team members and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. 

Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. 

The total number of people Maddy needs to serve is 15 (team members and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, the total number of pizzas needed is 39 / 3 = 13.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total amount Maddy will spend is 13 * 15 = $195.

The final answer is: $195"
"To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we first need to calculate the total space occupied by the topaz gemstones and the remaining space that will be filled by the sterling silver beads.

Each topaz gemstone is one inch long, and there are 8 of them in a necklace. So, the total space occupied by the topaz gemstones is 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. To find the remaining space for the sterling silver beads, we subtract the space occupied by the topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace: 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long. To find the number of sterling silver beads used, we divide the remaining space by the length of each bead: 17 / 0.25 = 68.

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"To find the total number of stories written in the first week, we need to add the number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot. 

Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week.
Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week.
Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week.

Total stories in the first week = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week. 

Alani doubled her 20 stories, so she wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories in the second week.
Braylen doubled his 40 stories, so he wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories in the second week.
Margot doubled her 60 stories, so she wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories in the second week.

Total stories in the second week = 40 + 80 + 120 = 240

To find the total number of stories written altogether, we need to add the total number of stories written in the first week and the second week.

Total stories = Total stories in the first week + Total stories in the second week
Total stories = 120 + 240
Total stories = 360

Kelly has 5 quarters, which is equivalent to 5 x 25 cents = 125 cents. She also has 2 dimes, which is equivalent to 2 x 10 cents = 20 cents. 

So, the total amount of money Kelly has is 125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents.

Now, let's subtract the cost of the can of pop, which is 55 cents. 

145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents.

"To find the number of rows of 5-star stars, we first need to find the total number of stars in the flag. 

The flag has three rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 3 * 8 = 24. 

It also has two rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 * 6 = 12. 

The total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36. 

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40. 

Since each 5-star row has 5 stars, the number of rows of 5-star stars is 40 / 5 = 8.

"Let's break down the information given. 

Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals. 

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals. 

It's given that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have. 

Let's represent the total number of medals given out as 'x'. Then, we have the equation: 39 = x / 10. 

To find 'x', we multiply both sides of the equation by 10: x = 39 * 10.

x = 390

"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many chocolate bars are available in total. Since each packet contains 5 chocolate bars and there are 8 packets, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

We know that each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults. So, the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

Now, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars: 40 - 24 = 16.

Since there are 8 children, we need to divide the remaining chocolate bars equally among them. To do this, we divide 16 by 8, which gives us 2.

Therefore, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

First, let's find out how many hours she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert her working hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals she works in 150 minutes:

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval:

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

So, Susan earns $75 for the online task. 

The final answer is: $75"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Initially, Mike has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, which is not over 20, so he gets no extra point.
Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he gets no extra point.
Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point.

So, after the extra points are distributed, the points are:
Mike: 21
Jim: 18
Tony: 43

Now, let's calculate the total points of all three players:
Total points = Mike's points + Jim's points + Tony's points
Total points = 21 + 18 + 43
Total points = 82

"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we first need to determine how many oranges the sons washed. 

The oldest son is 8 years old, and he washes as many oranges as he is years old, so he washes 8 oranges. 

The youngest son is half as old as the oldest son, which means he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. He also washes as many oranges as he is years old, so he washes 4 oranges.

In total, the sons wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Since Will buys 15 oranges, and the sons wash 12, the number of oranges left unwashed is 15 - 12 = 3.

"To find the total count of activities, we need to calculate the number of each activity done on both days and then add them up.

On the first day, Darren does:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

On the second day, he does:
- 20 more pushups than the first day, so 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 10 fewer squats than the first day, so 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- Doubles the number of dumbbell presses, so 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Now, let's add up the total number of each activity done in the two days:
- Total pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Total squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Total dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

The total count of activities is the sum of the total number of each activity: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370.

"To find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then divide the total amount of rice available by that amount.

First, let's calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day. Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 3 meals per day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). Since 5 members of the household eat rice every lunch and dinner, we'll assume they also eat it for breakfast. So, the total number of people eating rice per day is 5.

Total rice consumed per person per day = 0.2 kg/meal * 3 meals = 0.6 kg/day
Total rice consumed by 5 people per day = 0.6 kg/day * 5 people = 3 kg/day

Now, let's calculate how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last:

Total rice available = 42 kg
Total rice consumed per day = 3 kg

Number of days a 42 kg bag of rice will last = Total rice available / Total rice consumed per day
= 42 kg / 3 kg/day
= 14 days

Since we want to find out how many weeks it will last, we'll divide the number of days by 7 (number of days in a week):

Number of weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last = 14 days / 7 days/week
= 2 weeks

"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first need to calculate the total number of crates he sold in the week. 

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he sold bread for 5 days. 

He sold 20 crates over the weekend, which is 2 days. 
He sold 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday.

Total crates sold = 20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) 
Total crates sold = 65

Since he was closed on Monday and Friday, he had 5 working days. 
Total working days = 7 (days in a week) - 2 (days closed) 
Total working days = 5

Target for 5 working days = 120 (target for a week) / 7 (days in a week) * 5 (working days) 
Target for 5 working days = 85.71 (approximately)

Since we can't sell a fraction of a crate, we'll consider the target as 85 crates for 5 working days.

Crates off target = Target for 5 working days - Total crates sold 
Crates off target = 85 - 65 
Crates off target = 20

"To calculate the total cost, we need to find the total miles driven per year, the total bonus paid per year, and then add them together.

First, let's find the total miles driven per year. Since John goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, he goes to work 5 * 50 = 250 times a year. Since his work is 30 miles away and he has to go there and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 30 * 2 = 60 miles. Therefore, the total miles driven per year is 60 * 250 = 15,000 miles.

Next, let's find the total cost of driving per year. John is charged $2 per mile driven, so the total cost of driving per year is 15,000 * $2 = $30,000.

John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus paid per year is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

Now, let's add the total cost of driving per year and the total bonus paid per year to find the total amount John pays a year for driving: $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The final answer is: $31,800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to add the minutes he exercised on both days. 

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined minutes by 2.

Combined minutes: 39
Twice the combined minutes: 39 * 2 = 78 minutes

So, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process. 

When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two layers: the front and the back. 

For a 32-page tabloid, we need to have 32 pages in total. Since each piece of paper can be folded to create two layers, we can use one piece of paper to create two pages. 

However, we need to account for the fact that the first and last pages are on the outside, and the remaining pages are on the inside. 

Since we have 32 pages, we can divide them into two groups: the first 16 pages (pages 1-16) and the last 16 pages (pages 17-32). 

For the first 16 pages, we need 8 pieces of paper (since each piece of paper can create 2 pages). 

For the last 16 pages, we need 8 pieces of paper as well (since each piece of paper can create 2 pages).

However, we need to account for the fact that the first and last pages are on the outside, and they are already counted in the 8 pieces of paper for the first 16 pages and the last 16 pages. 

So, we need to add 1 more piece of paper to account for the first page (page 1) and 1 more piece of paper to account for the last page (page 32).

Therefore, the total number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid is 8 + 8 + 1 + 1 = 18.

She also spent an additional $10 on rides. So, the total amount she spent is:

$25 (food and snacks) + $10 (rides) = $35

Now, to find out how much she has left, we subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount she brought:

$50 (initial amount) - $35 (total spent) = $15

So, Annika has $15 left.

The final answer is: $15"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Total books = 250
- Unsold books = 50
- Books sold this year = 45
- Books sold in the first year = 2 * Books sold this year = 2 * 45 = 90
- Books sold in the second year = Total books - Unsold books - Books sold this year - Books sold in the first year
= 250 - 50 - 45 - 90
= 65

Since each book sells at $20, the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
Total money earned in the second year = Books sold in the second year * Price per book
= 65 * 20
= 1300

The final answer is: $1300"
"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week: 
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Since Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

In April, there are 4 weeks. So, his total earnings from his hourly wage in April are:
$500/week * 4 weeks = $2000

Now, let's add the weekly bonus for the whole month:
$2000 (hourly wage) + $300 (bonus) * 4 weeks = $2000 + $1200 = $3200

So, Watson made a total of $3200 in April. 

The final answer is: $3200"
"To find out how many people John lost to, we need to calculate 20% of 20, since he beat 80% of the people he arm wrestled.

20% of 20 is calculated as 0.20 * 20 = 4.

So, John lost to 4 people.

"To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we first need to determine how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 

Two-thirds of 60 is calculated as (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves sold in the morning.

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. The total number of loaves left is 60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. Half of 20 is calculated as (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are divided equally between the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses per week and then multiply that by the number of weeks it takes Sandy to lose the same amount of weight.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight Joey loses per week, we divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks:

Weight lost per week = Total weight lost / Number of weeks
Weight lost per week = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weight lost per week = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we multiply the weight lost per week by the number of weeks it takes Sandy:

Total weight lost = Weight lost per week * Number of weeks
Total weight lost = 2 pounds/week * 4 weeks
Total weight lost = 8 pounds

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

The original price of one tub of ice cream is $13, and it's now sold at $11. The discount on one tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $2.

Since you're buying 2 tubs of ice cream, the total discount on the ice cream will be 2 * $2 = $4.

The original price of one packet of milk is not given, but we know that it was sold at a discount of $0.5. Let's assume the original price of one packet of milk is x. The selling price of one packet of milk will be x - $0.5.

Since you're buying 4 packets of milk, the total discount on the milk will be 4 * ($x - $0.5). However, we don't know the value of x. We can express the total discount on the milk as 4x - 2.

The total savings will be the sum of the savings on the ice cream and the milk: $4 + (4x - 2).

However, we still need to find the value of x. We can use the information that the original price of the milk packet is not given, but we can assume it is the same as the original price of the ice cream tub, which is $13. 

If the original price of the milk packet is $13, then the selling price of the milk packet will be $13 - $0.5 = $12.5. 

Now we can find the value of x: x = $13.

Now we can find the total savings: $4 + (4 * $13 - 2) = $4 + $50 - 2 = $52.

The final answer is: $52"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after 15 days.

The serum causes a person to grow an extra arm every 3 days. To find out how many extra arms a person will grow in 15 days, we divide 15 by 3. 

15 / 3 = 5

So, a person will grow 5 extra arms.

The serum causes a person to grow an extra leg every 5 days. To find out how many extra legs a person will grow in 15 days, we divide 15 by 5.

15 / 5 = 3

So, a person will grow 3 extra legs.

To find the total number of new limbs, we add the number of extra arms and legs.

5 (extra arms) + 3 (extra legs) = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Theo has $6000 to spend on his business trip.
2. He buys 6 business suits at $100 each, so the total cost of suits is 6 * $100 = $600.
3. He buys 3 suitcases at $50 each, so the total cost of suitcases is 3 * $50 = $150.
4. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. The cost of a business suit is $100, so 5 times that is 5 * $100 = $500. The flight ticket costs $500 + $700 = $1200.
5. He wishes to save $2000 for the trip.

Now, let's calculate the total amount spent so far:
- Cost of suits: $600
- Cost of suitcases: $150
- Cost of flight ticket: $1200
Total spent so far: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Since Theo wants to save $2000, he can spend a maximum of $6000 - $2000 = $4000.

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent so far from the maximum amount he can spend:
$4000 - $1950 = $2050

This is the amount he has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

The final answer is: $2050"
"To find out how many eggs the family consumes in a week, we first need to determine how many eggs they eat in a day. 

There are 5 people in the family. Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so the total number of eggs they eat is 3 * 3 = 9 eggs. The rest of the family, which is 5 - 3 = 2 people, eat 2 eggs each day. So, the total number of eggs they eat is 2 * 2 = 4 eggs. 

In total, the family eats 9 + 4 = 13 eggs per day. 

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of eggs the family consumes in a week is 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

"Let's break down the information given. We know that Quinn is 30 years old. Since Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, we can calculate Jane's age by subtracting 3 from Quinn's age.

Jane's age = Quinn's age - 3
Jane's age = 30 - 3
Jane's age = 27

Now, we know that Trent is 5 years older than Jane. To find Trent's age, we can add 5 to Jane's age.

Trent's age = Jane's age + 5
Trent's age = 27 + 5
Trent's age = 32

1. Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
2. At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.
3. The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, so it was 3000 * 20 = 60000.
4. Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, the current population is 2 * 60000 = 120000.

"Let's break down the information given. 

Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is D/2.

We know that the total number of players on the team is 105. The sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams is equal to 105. 

So, we can write the equation: 2D + D + D/2 = 105.

To solve for D, we need to get rid of the fraction. Multiplying the entire equation by 2 will eliminate the fraction: 4D + 2D + D = 210.

Combining like terms, we get 7D = 210.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get D = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of people invited, we first need to calculate the number of people from the 2 families with 6 people and the 3 families with 4 people.

For the 2 families with 6 people, the total number of people is 2 * 6 = 12.
For the 3 families with 4 people, the total number of people is 3 * 4 = 12.
So, the total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. This means 8 people are subtracted from the total number of people invited, leaving 24 - 8 = 16 people.

Now, 1/4 of the people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments. 1/4 of 8 is 2. So, 2 people had previous commitments and couldn't come to the party.

To find the number of people who show up for Martha's party, we subtract the number of people who had previous commitments from the number of people who were not ill. 16 - 2 = 14.

"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, his father gave him 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 (initial marbles) + 20 (bought from Johanna) + 8 (given by his father) = 98 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 98 * 2 = 196 kgs.

The final answer is: 196"
"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool first. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as a pool) is length x width x height.

Given dimensions: 
- Length (L) = 6 feet
- Width (W) = 4 feet
- Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume = L x W x H = 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet

Now, we know the cost to fill the pool is $0.1 per cubic foot. To find the total cost, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot.

Total cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot = 120 x 0.1 = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we first need to determine the number of girls and nongendered children.

Since there are 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.

The number of nongendered children is 1/10 as many as the number of boys, so it is 30 / 10 = 3.

To find the total number of children, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

The final answer is: 123"
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles:

1 (electric pole) : 3 (electric wires) = x (electric poles) : 45 (electric wires)

We can cross-multiply to solve for x:

1 * 45 = 3x
45 = 3x
x = 45 / 3
x = 15

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of people who left the party. We know that 1/4 of the total number of people left, and 22 men stayed. 

Let's denote the total number of people as 'x'. Since 1/4 of the people left, 3/4 of the people stayed. We can set up the equation:

3/4 * x = 22 + (number of women who stayed)

We know that the total number of people at the beginning was 25 men + 15 women = 40 people. So, x = 40.

Now, we can substitute x = 40 into the equation:

3/4 * 40 = 22 + (number of women who stayed)

30 = 22 + (number of women who stayed)

To find the number of women who stayed, we subtract 22 from both sides:

number of women who stayed = 30 - 22
number of women who stayed = 8

Since there were 15 women at the beginning, the number of women who left is 15 - 8 = 7.

The total number of people who left is 1/4 of the total number of people, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10. Since 7 women left, the number of men who left is 10 - 7 = 3.

We know that 22 men stayed, and 3 men left, so the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3.

Now, we can verify that the total number of people who left is indeed 10, which is 1/4 of the total number of people.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To find the cost of the pen, we first need to determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. To find out how many pencils are in each box, we need to divide the total number of pencils by the number of boxes. 

26 (total pencils) / 3 (number of boxes) = 8.67 pencils per box. 

Since we can't have a fraction of a pencil, we'll round down to 8 pencils per box. 

Now, let's calculate the total number of pencils Jam has: 3 boxes * 8 pencils per box = 24 pencils. 

We already know Jam has 2 loose pencils, so the total number of pencils Jam has is 24 + 2 = 26 pencils.

Meg has 46 pencils. 

To find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have, we add their pencils together: 26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72 pencils.

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we need to divide the total number of pencils by 8 to find the number of boxes needed: 72 (total pencils) / 8 (pencils per box) = 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weakening effect of the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's calculate the weakening effect of the ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and makes it 12 milliliters weaker. Since Shannon cools her coffee by 65 degrees, we need to find out how many ice cubes are required to achieve this. 

Let's assume the initial temperature of the coffee is 100 degrees (for simplicity). To cool it down to 35 degrees (100 - 65 = 35), we need to use ice cubes that cool the coffee by 13 degrees each. 

Number of ice cubes = (100 - 35) / 13 = 65 / 13 = 5

Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, 5 ice cubes will make it 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Next, we need to consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. Since any added liquid weakens the coffee, we add this to the total weakening effect of the ice cubes.

Total weakening effect = 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters

The final answer is: 75"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Since 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can assume that the ratio of new records to old records is 1:2. This means that for every 1 new record, 2 old records are traded.

Since 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of new records as 7. 

Now, we can use the ratio to find the total number of old records traded. If 1 new record is traded for 2 old records, then 7 new records would be traded for 7 * 2 = 14 old records.

However, this is the total number of old records traded by all 5 people. To find the number of old records each person brought in, we need to divide the total number of old records by the number of people.

So, the total number of old records is 14, and the number of people is 5. 

14 / 5 = 2.8

However, since you can't trade a fraction of a record, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we can also consider that the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records, and the 5 people left with 7 new records. This means that the 5 people brought in 14 old records and got 7 new records in return. This is a 2:1 ratio, so the 5 people brought in 2 * 7 = 14 old records."
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we first need to find the number of junior and senior programmers, and then their respective salaries.

The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 100. 
2/5 * 100 = 40 junior programmers.

Since the number of senior programmers is the remaining 3/5 of the total number of employees, we can find it by subtracting the number of junior programmers from the total number of employees.
100 - 40 = 60 senior programmers.

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, who are paid $2000 per month. So, senior programmers are paid $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

Now, we can find the total amount of money the company pays to all the junior programmers per month by multiplying the number of junior programmers by their salary.
40 * $2000 = $80000

Similarly, we can find the total amount of money the company pays to all the senior programmers per month by multiplying the number of senior programmers by their salary.
60 * $2400 = $144000

Finally, we can find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month by adding the total amount paid to junior and senior programmers.
$80000 + $144000 = $224000

"Let's break down the information given. 

Initially, there were 'x' people on the bus at the terminal. 

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total became x + 5.

At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, and 8 more got in. So, the total became (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6.

We are given that the total number of people at the third stop is 20. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + 6 = 20.

To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate it. Subtract 6 from both sides of the equation: x = 20 - 6.

x = 14.

"To find out how long it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to first determine how many percentage points are left to charge. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it still needs 100% - 60% = 40% to be fully charged.

Given that the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it takes to charge 40% as follows:

40 percentage points / 1 percentage point per 3 minutes = 40 * 3 minutes

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

These rewards are then applied to the current shopping trip. The customer spent $43 and used their rewards, so we subtract the rewards from the price: $43 - $4 = $39.

However, the customer also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since the rewards are $4, twice that amount is $8. We subtract this from the price: $39 - $8 = $31.

"To determine which job pays more, we need to calculate the net pay for each job.

For Job A, the total income is $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year. The total tax is 20% of $30,000, which is 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000. The net pay for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

For Job B, the total income is $42,000. The property tax is $6,000, so the net income before taxes is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. The tax on this is 10% of $36,000, which is 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600. The net pay for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

Since $32,400 is greater than $24,000, Job B pays more. To find the difference in net pay, we subtract the net pay of Job A from the net pay of Job B: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the price of the shares after the first year and then after the second year.

Initially, Maria buys 8 shares for $8 each, so the total cost is 8 * 8 = $64.

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price, we multiply the original price by 1.5 (100% + 50% = 150%, or 1.5 as a decimal). 

New price after the first year = $8 * 1.5 = $12.

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. To find the new price, we multiply the price after the first year by 0.75 (100% - 25% = 75%, or 0.75 as a decimal).

New price after the second year = $12 * 0.75 = $9.

Now, we multiply the new price after the second year by the number of shares to find the final value of Maria's shares.

Final value = 8 * $9 = $72.

Let's assume the number of students in the two equal groups is x. Since the last group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the last group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 200. Since the two equal groups have the same number of students, we can write the equation:

2x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

Now that we know the number of students in each of the two equal groups, we can find the number of students in the smallest group:

Number of students in the smallest group = x - 10
= 70 - 10
= 60

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's break down the information given. Farmer Brown has a total of 60 animals, and he has twice as many chickens as cows. 

Let's denote the number of cows as 'c' and the number of chickens as '2c'. Since the total number of animals is 60, we can set up the equation:

c + 2c = 60

Combine like terms:

3c = 60

Divide both sides by 3:

c = 20

So, there are 20 cows and 2c = 40 chickens.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. 

Total legs from cows: 20 * 4 = 80
Total legs from chickens: 40 * 2 = 80

Total legs from all animals: 80 + 80 = 160

The final answer is: 160"
"To find out how many balls Josh is juggling at the talent show, we need to determine how many balls he was juggling before the incident and then subtract the balls that were lost.

Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. So, the total number of balls he was juggling before the incident is 3 + (1 * 4) = 7.

However, 3 balls were lost during the incident. 2 were caught by the crowd, but 1 was lost completely. So, we subtract 1 from the total number of balls lost, since 2 were recovered.

The number of balls Josh is juggling at the talent show is 7 - 1 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, so they also weigh 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal:

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Laurel initially received 24 baby outfits from her friend. 
Then, she received twice the amount of new baby outfits at her baby shower, which is 2 * 24 = 48 outfits. 
So, the total number of outfits she received at the baby shower is 24 + 48 = 72 outfits. 
Now, her mom gifted her with another 15 baby outfits. 
To find the total number of outfits, we add the outfits she received from her friend, the baby shower, and her mom: 24 + 72 + 15 = 111 outfits.

The final answer is: 111"
"To find the total distance Tyson covered in June, we first need to calculate the new daily distance he needs to run based on his coach's advice. 

The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day. This means we need to find 1/5 of 5000 meters and add it to the original distance.

1/5 of 5000 meters is (1/5) * 5000 = 1000 meters.

So, the new daily distance is 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters.

Since there are 30 days in June, we multiply the new daily distance by 30 to find the total distance covered in June.

Total distance = 6000 meters/day * 30 days = 180,000 meters.

The final answer is: 180000"
"To find the price difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B, we first need to determine the price of each juice box.

Juice Box A is 4 dollars.
Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it's 4 + 5 = 9 dollars.
Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it's 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

Now, to find the price difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B, we subtract the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C: 11 - 9 = 2.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the total number of legs from the tables with 4 legs and the tables with 3 legs separately and then add them together.

The tables with 4 legs have a total of 40 * 4 = 160 legs.

The tables with 3 legs have a total of 50 * 3 = 150 legs.

Now, we add the total number of legs from both types of tables: 160 + 150 = 310.

The total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310."
"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we first need to determine how many cookies are used by her son and her husband. 

Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so he eats 4 * 5 = 20 cookies per week. 

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats 1 * 7 = 7 cookies per week.

The total number of cookies used by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies per week.

Since each bag has 36 cookies, and 27 cookies are used by her son and husband, Jenny eats the remaining cookies. 

36 (total cookies in a bag) - 27 (cookies used by son and husband) = 9 cookies.

Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To find the total cost of the shirts, we first need to calculate the discount amount. 

The original price of each shirt is $30. 
The discount percentage is 40%. 
To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (as a decimal): 
$30 * 0.4 = $12 

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the discounted price of one shirt: 
$30 - $12 = $18 

Since Davos bought 2 shirts, we multiply the discounted price by 2 to get the total cost: 
$18 * 2 = $36 

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the percentage increase in the amount of money the factory is making per day, we need to first find the difference in the amount of money they are making per day now and the amount they used to make per day.

The factory used to make $100 per tractor and sold 10 tractors a day, so they made $100 * 10 = $1000 per day.

Now, they make $220 per silo and sell 5 silos a day, so they make $220 * 5 = $1100 per day.

The difference in the amount of money they are making per day now and the amount they used to make per day is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original amount and multiply by 100:

($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now. 

10%"
"To find out how much Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the total monthly expenses and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's find the monthly expenses. 

Food costs $25 per week, and there are 4 weeks in a month, so the monthly food cost is:
$25/week * 4 weeks/month = $100/month

Treats cost $20 per month.

Medicine costs $100 per month.

Now, let's add up the monthly expenses:
$100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total yearly expenses are:
$220/month * 12 months/year = $2640/year

The final answer is: $2640"
"To find the total time spent on after-work activities, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and add them up.

- Monday's yoga class is 1 hour.
- Tuesday's cooking class is 3 times as long as Monday's yoga, so it's 1 * 3 = 3 hours.
- Wednesday's cheese-tasting event is 0.5 hours (half an hour).
- Thursday's museum tour is half as long as the cooking class, so it's 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours.
- Friday's errands are 2 hours.

Now, let's add up the time spent on each activity:
1 (Monday) + 3 (Tuesday) + 0.5 (Wednesday) + 1.5 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 7.5 hours.

The final answer is: 7.5"
"To find out how many plant pots April has left over, we first need to determine the total number of plant pots she needs for the school garden. 

The school needs 30 plant pots for the daisies. Since they need twice as many for the roses, we multiply 30 by 2 to get the number of plant pots needed for the roses. 

30 * 2 = 60

So, the total number of plant pots needed for both daisies and roses is 30 + 60 = 90.

Since April had already bought 100 plant pots, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number she bought to find out how many she has left over.

100 - 90 = 10

Therefore, April has 10 plant pots left over. 

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent from the initial amount she had. 

First, let's calculate the total amount she spent. She spent $11 on a sweater and gave her brother $4, so the total amount spent is $11 + $4 = $15.

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount she had: $36 - $15 = $21.

Andrea saved $21."
"To find the total time John spent, we need to calculate the time he spent boating, swimming, and watching shows. 

He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. 

He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

We are given that this is 70% of the total time (since 30% was spent sightseeing). Let's represent the total time as 'x'. We can set up the equation: 0.7x = 15.

To find 'x', we divide both sides by 0.7: x = 15 / 0.7 = 21.43 hours.

Now, we need to find the time spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time. We can calculate this by multiplying the total time by 0.4: 0.4 * 21.43 = 8.57 hours.

The final answer is: 8.57"
"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we first need to calculate how much money she has earned from both jobs. 

From her first job, she earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so she earns 10 * 20 = $200. 

From her second job, she earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so she earns 5 * 15 = $75.

In total, Annabelle earns $200 + $75 = $275 from both jobs.

Since she already has $80 in her savings, we add this to the money she earned: $275 + $80 = $355.

The phone costs $400, so to find out how much more money Annabelle needs to save, we subtract the amount she has from the cost of the phone: $400 - $355 = $45.

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save $45.

The final answer is: $45"
"To find the height of the tallest tree, we first need to find the combined height of the two shorter trees. The shortest tree is 6 feet tall, and the second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so it's 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall. 

The combined height of the two shorter trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet. 

Since the height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined, we multiply the combined height by 2: 17 * 2 = 34 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is 34 feet.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he spent at the toy store. 

The cost of 6 toy cars is 6 * $2 = $12. 
The cost of 5 teddy bears is 5 * $1 = $5. 
The total cost of the toys is $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially had $28. After spending $17, he had $28 - $17 = $11 left. 

His mother then gave him an extra $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

The final answer is: $21"
"Let's break down the expenses for Morgan's birthday party. 

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the go-karts. Since she wants to ride the go-karts twice, the cost will be 2 * $10 = $20. 

Next, we need to add the cost of the mini-golf and the arcade tokens. The cost of the mini-golf is $5, and the cost of the arcade tokens is $5. So, the total cost for these activities is $5 + $5 = $10.

Now, we need to add the cost of the go-karts and the other activities to find the total cost. The total cost is $20 + $10 = $30.

Since Morgan has a budget of $90, we can subtract the total cost from her budget to find out how much money is left for inviting friends. $90 - $30 = $60.

Since each friend will cost $0 (assuming the cost of inviting friends is $0), we can invite as many friends as we want with the remaining budget. However, we need to consider the cost of food, drinks, and other expenses that are not mentioned in the problem. 

To find the number of friends she can invite, we need to assume that the remaining budget is only for the friends. However, this is not the case. We can only assume that the remaining budget is for the friends if we consider the other expenses as $0. 

Let's assume that the remaining budget is for the friends. The number of friends she can invite is $60 / $0 = undefined. However, this is not the correct answer because we cannot divide by zero.

Marisa buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, so the total amount she spends on lollipops each day is:
4 lollipops * 25 cents/lollipop = 100 cents or $1

Since Marisa gets $5 as pocket money each day, the amount she saves each day is:
$5 - $1 = $4

Now, we need to find out how much she saves in 5 days:
$4/day * 5 days = $20

So, Marisa puts $20 in her piggy bank if she saves for 5 days.

$20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, Billy buys candy with $10. The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound. Let's assume he buys x pounds of candy. The total cost of the candy will be 1.5x dollars.

Since Billy has $10, the amount of change he gets is 10 - 1.5x.

He then takes half of this change and spends it on gumballs. The cost of each gumball is $0.05, and he buys 40 gumballs. The total cost of the gumballs is 0.05 * 40 = $2.

Since he takes half of his change, the amount he spends on gumballs is (10 - 1.5x) / 2. This amount is equal to the total cost of the gumballs, which is $2.

Now, we can set up an equation to solve for x:

(10 - 1.5x) / 2 = 2

Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

10 - 1.5x = 4

Subtract 10 from both sides:

-1.5x = -6

Divide both sides by -1.5:

x = 4

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Let's break down the information given. Carver's age is 45, and it's 5 years less than twice the age of his son. 

Let's represent the son's age as 'x'. According to the information, 2x - 5 = 45. 

To find the son's age, we need to solve for 'x'. 

First, add 5 to both sides of the equation: 2x = 45 + 5
2x = 50

Next, divide both sides by 2: x = 50 / 2
x = 25

The son is 25 years old.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to add the distances between the three cities. The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles, and the distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. 

The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs, which is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. So, the distance from the third city to the first city is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance for one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance the train can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the total distance it travels in a day (900 miles).

18,000 / 900 = 20 days.

"To find the amount of stuffing needed for the collie beds, we first need to find the average amount of stuffing between the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds. 

The average amount of stuffing is (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we need to find the total amount of stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds. 

For the chihuahua beds, 4 beds * 2 pounds of stuffing per bed = 8 pounds of stuffing.

For the collie beds, 3 beds * 5 pounds of stuffing per bed = 15 pounds of stuffing.

The total amount of stuffing needed is 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

"To find the total time taken for the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the trip and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time taken for the trip to his friend's house. The distance is 200 miles and the speed is 70 mph. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 miles / 70 mph
Time = 2.857 hours (approximately)

However, he took a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. So, the actual distance traveled to his friend's house is 200 + 10 = 210 miles. 

Time taken for the detour part = 10 miles / 70 mph
Time taken for the detour part = 0.143 hours (approximately)

Total time taken to reach his friend's house = 2.857 hours + 0.143 hours
Total time taken to reach his friend's house = 3 hours

Now, let's calculate the time taken for the trip back home. The distance is 240 miles and the speed is 80 mph.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 240 miles / 80 mph
Time = 3 hours

Total time taken for the trip = Time taken to reach his friend's house + Time taken for the trip back home
Total time taken for the trip = 3 hours + 3 hours
Total time taken for the trip = 6 hours

"To find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we first need to find the total number of fourth-graders present on Friday. 

Total fourth-graders = 96
Absent fourth-graders = 5 (girls) + 4 (boys) = 9
Total fourth-graders present = Total fourth-graders - Absent fourth-graders
Total fourth-graders present = 96 - 9 = 87

Now, we know that 43 out of the total 96 fourth-graders are girls. To find the number of fourth-grade boys, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of fourth-graders.

Total fourth-grade boys = Total fourth-graders - Total girls
Total fourth-grade boys = 96 - 43
Total fourth-grade boys = 53

However, we need to find the number of fourth-grade boys present on Friday. Since 4 boys were absent, we subtract the absent boys from the total number of boys.

Fourth-grade boys present = Total fourth-grade boys - Absent boys
Fourth-grade boys present = 53 - 4
Fourth-grade boys present = 49

"Let's break down the information given:

1. 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 
   Since 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, four times that many is 4 * 3 = 12. 
   Four times that many minus 5 is 12 - 5 = 7. So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 
   Since 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting, three times that many is 3 * 7 = 21. 
   So, 21 customers were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.

Now, let's add up the number of customers kicked out for each reason:
- Refusing to wear masks: 3
- Shoplifting: 7
- Physical violence over goods on sale: 21

Total number of customers kicked out for these reasons = 3 + 7 + 21 = 31

Since a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:
50 - 31 = 19

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many points Erin has now. Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, and Sara scored 8 points, we can calculate Erin's current points as 3 times Sara's points plus Sara's points.

Erin's current points = 3 * Sara's points + Sara's points
Erin's current points = 3 * 8 + 8
Erin's current points = 24 + 8
Erin's current points = 32

Now, we know Erin scored 14 points and has 32 points in total. To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to subtract the points she scored from her current points.

Erin's points before = Erin's current points - points scored
Erin's points before = 32 - 14
Erin's points before = 18

"To find the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. There are 44 seniors, and each picture frame costs $20. So, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of etching the logo on each picture frame. The etching costs an additional 20% of the cost of the picture frame, which is 20% of $20, or 0.2 * $20 = $4. So, the total cost of etching the logo on all 44 picture frames is 44 * $4 = $176.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the pins. 2 seniors will receive pins, and each pin costs $5. So, the total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the cords. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 1/4 * 44 = 11 officers. Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12. So, the total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we can add up the costs of the picture frames, etching, pins, and cords to find the total cost of the senior gifts. The total cost is $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final answer is: $1198"

"To find the total number of tennis shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did the day before, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit, so we need to subtract those from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday. 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add up the total number of shoes sold: 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, we multiply the total number of pairs by 2 to get the total number of shoes sold: 50 * 2 = 100.

"To find the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to find the value of the faulty pieces. 

The total value of the equipment is $400,000. 40% of this is faulty. 

40% of $400,000 = 0.4 * $400,000 = $160,000

This means the faulty pieces are worth $160,000. 

To find the value of the functioning pieces, we subtract the value of the faulty pieces from the total value.

Value of functioning pieces = Total value - Value of faulty pieces

"To find out how much milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from the half of the sheep that gives 1 kg of milk and the half that gives 2 kg of milk.

First, let's find out how many sheep are in each half. Since Mary has 30 sheep, half of them would be 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

The first half of the sheep gives 1 kg of milk each, so the total milk from this half would be 15 * 1 = 15 kg.

The second half of the sheep gives 2 kg of milk each, so the total milk from this half would be 15 * 2 = 30 kg.

Now, let's add the milk from both halves to find the total milk collected every day. 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

"To find out how many pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we first need to determine how many rolls were left after feeding her children. Since she made a dozen (12) rolls and fed 6 to her children, we subtract 6 from 12 to get the number of rolls left.

12 (initial rolls) - 6 (rolls fed to children) = 6 rolls left

Since each of the remaining 6 rolls was broken into 8 pieces, we multiply 6 by 8 to find the total number of pieces fed to the chickens.

6 (rolls left) * 8 (pieces per roll) = 48

So, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

Since each pair of socks contains 2 socks, washing 10 pairs of socks means Lindsay has washed 10 * 2 = 20 socks from the pairs. 

Adding the 15 loose socks, Lindsay has washed a total of 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks that need washing, to find out how many socks Lindsay has missed, we subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks that need washing: 50 - 35 = 15.

So, Lindsay has missed 15 socks.

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total interest she has to pay and then divide it by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the total interest:

Interest = Principal * Rate * Time
Principal = $3,650
Rate = 10% or 0.10
Time = 5 months

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Interest = $1,825

Now, we need to add the interest to the principal to find the total amount Karan has to pay:
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $3,650 + $1,825
Total Amount = $5,475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by the number of months:

"To find the total profit per hour, we first need to determine the total amount of money Millie makes per hour and then subtract the cost of supplies per hour.

First, let's find the total amount of money Millie makes per hour. Since she sells 4 cups per hour and each cup is sold for $1, her total earnings per hour are 4 * $1 = $4.

Next, we need to find the total amount of money Millie spends on supplies per hour. Since she buys enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade for $18, and each pitcher holds 12 cups, she has a total of 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade. Since she sells all of the lemonade, she sells 36 cups per day. However, we are interested in the profit per hour, so we need to find out how many hours it takes her to sell 36 cups. Since she sells 4 cups per hour, it takes her 36 / 4 = 9 hours to sell 36 cups. 

Now, we can find the cost of supplies per hour by dividing the total cost of supplies ($18) by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade (9 hours). The cost of supplies per hour is $18 / 9 = $2.

Now, we can find the profit per hour by subtracting the cost of supplies per hour from the total earnings per hour. The profit per hour is $4 - $2 = $2.

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu and add it to the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson.

First, let's find the number of messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

"To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we first need to find out how many popsicles each of them has. 

Let's assume the number of popsicles Betty has is 5x and the number of popsicles Sam has is 6x. 

Since the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, we can write the equation: 5x + 6x = 165

Combine like terms: 11x = 165

Divide both sides by 11: x = 15

Now that we know x, we can find the number of popsicles each of them has. Betty has 5x = 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles. Sam has 6x = 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month. 

For Hulu and Disney Plus, the normal cost is $10 each, but he gets a 20% discount for bundling. The discount amount is 20% of $10 + $10 = $20. 
20% of $20 is 0.2 * $20 = $4. 
So, the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 + $10 - $4 = $16 per month.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26 per month.

Since Tim was paying $60 for the cable package, he saves $60 - $26 = $34 per month by canceling his cable subscription.

Now, Erica has 20 (initial cards) + 30 (pre-made cards) = 50 cards in total.

She then passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, which means she gave away a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

After giving away 29 cards, Erica has 50 - 29 = 21 cards left.

However, she received 17 cards from family and friends. So, the total number of cards she now has is 21 (remaining cards) + 17 (new cards) = 38 cards.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find out how many slices are left, we first need to determine how many slices Jenny gave away. 

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, we can calculate the number of slices Bill received as follows: 
1/3 * 12 = 4 slices

Jenny gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. We can calculate the number of slices Mark received as follows: 
1/4 * 12 = 3 slices

In total, Jenny gave away 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny ate 2 slices, so the total number of slices she gave away and ate is 7 + 2 = 9 slices.

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total number of slices given away and eaten from the total number of slices: 
12 - 9 = 3 slices

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many days Mark needs to save his money, we need to divide the cost of the bike by his daily earnings.

Cost of the bike: $300
Daily earnings: $10

Number of days = Cost of the bike / Daily earnings
= $300 / $10
= 30

So, Mark needs to save his money for 30 days to buy the bike.

30"
"To find the total number of bugs, we first need to find the number of millipedes and stink bugs. 

Nancy saw 90 spiders. Since there are 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders, we can find the number of millipedes by multiplying the number of spiders by 1/3. 

Number of millipedes = 90 * (1/3) = 30

Next, we need to find the number of stink bugs. The number of stink bugs is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. 

Number of stink bugs = 2 * 30 - 12 = 48

Now, we can find the total number of bugs by adding the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs.

Total number of bugs = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168

The final answer is: 168"
"To find the difference between Alice and Erica's ages, we first need to determine Alice's age. Since Beth is 5 years older than Erica, and Erica is 30 years old, Beth's age is 30 + 5 = 35 years.

Since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, Alice's age is 35 + 7 = 42 years.

The difference between Alice and Erica's ages is 42 - 30 = 12 years.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total calories consumed by John, we need to calculate the total ounces of milk he drank and then multiply it by the calories per ounce.

John drank 2 glasses of milk, and each glass is 8 ounces. So, the total ounces of milk he drank is 2 * 8 = 16 ounces.

Since milk has 3 calories per ounce, the total calories consumed by John is 16 * 3 = 48 calories.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find out how much the builder earns in a year, we first need to calculate his daily earnings and then multiply it by the total number of days he works in a year.

The builder works 6 days a week and 4 weeks a month, so the total number of days he works in a month is 6 * 4 = 24 days.

Since he gets paid $50 every day, his monthly earnings would be 24 * $50 = $1200.

There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of days he works in a year is 24 * 12 = 288 days.

Now, we can find his yearly earnings by multiplying his daily earnings by the total number of days he works in a year: $50 * 288 = $14400.

The final answer is: $14400"
"To find out how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for the quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, we multiply the ingredients by 4.

For flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
For milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark will need to buy:
12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark will need to buy:
4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the original energy consumption and the new energy consumption. 

The original energy consumption is 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh) per day. 

Since 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) is equal to 1000 watt-hours (Wh), the original energy consumption is 7200 Wh / 1000 = 7.2 kWh per day.

If Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, the new energy consumption is 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh per day. 

The new energy consumption in kWh is 2700 Wh / 1000 = 2.7 kWh per day.

The energy saved per day is the original energy consumption minus the new energy consumption: 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh per day.

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily energy saved by 30: 4.5 kWh/day * 30 days = 135 kWh.

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the average number of stripes, we first need to find the total number of stripes and then divide it by the total number of zebras.

There are two zebras with 17 stripes each, so that's 2 * 17 = 34 stripes. 
There's a zebra with 36 stripes. 
There's another zebra with half the number of stripes as the third zebra, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

The total number of stripes is 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.
There are 4 zebras in total.

The average number of stripes is 88 / 4 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we first need to calculate the total number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves:

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we need a total of 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so the total cost of the meat is:
5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so the total cost of the cheese is:
5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is the sum of the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese:
$35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

The final answer is: $50.00"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

Initially, Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, he has 2 * 40 = 80 corns.

He bought 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. So, he bought 60 cannolis and 60 - 40 = 20 corns.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cannolis and corns Allan has after the purchase. 
Total cannolis = Initial cannolis + cannolis bought = 40 + 60 = 100
Total corns = Initial corns + corns bought = 80 + 20 = 100

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 + 100 = 200."
"Let's break down the information given. Elliott wants to walk 10,000 steps in total. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. 

He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, the total steps he has taken so far is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Since he had 2,000 steps left to take after his jog, we can find the total steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the total steps he wanted to take. 

Total steps he wanted to take: 10,000
Steps taken so far: 6,000
Steps left: 2,000

Steps taken during the jog = Total steps - Steps taken so far - Steps left
Steps taken during the jog = 10,000 - 6,000 - 2,000
Steps taken during the jog = 2,000

The final answer is: 2000"
"To find out how many minutes Toby will be early, we first need to determine how long it will take him to read the book. 

The book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page, so the total number of words in the book is 45 * 200 = 9000 words.

Toby can read at a rate of 300 words per minute, so the time it will take him to read the book is 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes.

Since it takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, Toby will arrive 30 + 10 = 40 minutes after he starts reading.

However, Toby plans to leave as soon as he finishes the book, and he has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport. 

So, the time difference between when he finishes the book and when he needs to be at the airport is 60 - 40 = 20 minutes.

Therefore, Toby will be 20 minutes early.

"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we first need to calculate the total number of employees and the total hours worked.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. 

The total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 hours * $15 per hour = $2400.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees left is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30 employees.

Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks in June, so the total hours worked by each employee in June is 40 * 4 = 160 hours.

The total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 hours * $15 per hour = $2400.

The total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 employees * $2400 = $96000.

The total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 employees * $2400 = $72000.

The total amount paid to all employees in the two months is $96000 + $72000 = $168000.

The final answer is: $168000"
"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds and the sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off,"" we can break it down as follows:

- The first pound costs $3.
- The second pound is 1/2 off, so it's 1/2 * $3 = $1.50 off. Therefore, the second pound costs $3 - $1.50 = $1.50.
- The total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. She bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total amount Tim spent, we first need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks. The first package costs $400, and the second package costs twice that much, which is 2 * $400 = $800. 

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200. 

Since Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packages, we need to calculate the discount amount. 20% of $1200 is 0.2 * $1200 = $240. 

The discount amount is subtracted from the total cost of the two packages: $1200 - $240 = $960. 

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted cost of the fireworks: $960 + $150 = $1110.

The total amount Tim spent is $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we first need to calculate how many cookies she eats in 30 days. 

Since Shannon eats 2 cookies a night, we multiply the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of nights in 30 days. There are 30 nights in 30 days. 

2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since Shannon wants to have enough cookies for 30 days, we need to make 60 cookies. However, her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies at a time. 

To find out how many dozens of cookies she needs to make, we divide the total number of cookies needed by the number of cookies her recipe makes per batch. 

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen cookies

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days. 

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. 

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the candles have this defect, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of candles that smell like wet dog = Total number of candles * (Percentage of candles with the defect / 100)
= 50000 * (5 / 100)
= 2500

Now, we need to find the number of candles that are both defective and guaranteed not to explode. Since 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, 1% of the candles are guaranteed to explode. However, we are interested in the candles that are guaranteed not to explode, so we will use 99% of the total candles.

Number of candles that are guaranteed not to explode = Total number of candles * (Percentage of candles not guaranteed to explode / 100)
= 50000 * (99 / 100)
= 49500

However, we are interested in the candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. Since the problem states that 5% of the more dangerous candles (i.e., the ones that are guaranteed to explode) have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog, we can calculate the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode as follows:

Number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode = Number of candles that are guaranteed to explode * (Percentage of candles with the defect / 100)
= 1% of 50000 * (5 / 100)
= 0.01 * 50000 * (5 / 100)
= 0.01 * 2500
= 25

The discount amount is 30% of the regular price, which is 0.3 * $20 = $6. 

So, the discounted price of each blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is 4 * $14 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.
- The combined total of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is 30 + 60 + 15 + 45 = 150 apples.
- Since the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - 150 = 350 apples.
- Since Joanne gathers some apples from the average trees, we need to find out how many apples she gathered from the average trees. Let's denote the number of apples she gathered from the average trees as 'x'.
- The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 30 (from the tallest trees) + 15 (from the shortest trees) + x (from the average trees) = 45 + x.
- The total number of apples gathered by her sister is 60 (from the tallest trees) + 45 (from the shortest trees) = 105 apples.
- The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so 45 + x + 105 = 500.
- Solving for x, we get x = 500 - 150 = 350.

However, this is the total number of apples gathered from the average trees by both sisters. Since the problem asks for the number of apples gathered by Joanne from the average trees, we need to find out how many apples she gathered from the average trees. Let's denote the number of apples she gathered from the average trees as 'y'. We already know that the total number of apples gathered from the average trees is 350, so y = 350.

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. We know that each camel has 2 humps and each dromedary has 1 hump. The total number of humps is 304, so we can write the equation:

2C + D = 304

We also know that the total number of heads is 180, which means the total number of camels and dromedaries is 180. So, we can write another equation:

C + D = 180

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve for C and D by subtracting the second equation from the first:

2C + D - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know C, we can substitute it into the second equation to find D:

124 + D = 180
D = 56

So, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd.

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down the information given.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is 4 * 200 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers. So, the total distance covered in the next two days is 240 kilometers.

On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance covered is 0 kilometers.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance covered in the second week is 7 * 300 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, let's add up the distances covered in each period: 
- First 4 days: 800 kilometers
- Next two days: 240 kilometers
- Next day: 0 kilometers
- Second week: 2100 kilometers

Total distance = 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

"To find the number of cats left on the rock, we first need to determine the number of cats taken away by the boats and then subtract that from the initial number of cats. 

Initially, there were 50 cats. Four boats came and each took 5 cats, so the total number of cats taken away is 4 * 5 = 20. 

Now, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30.

After that, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find the number of cats that ran after the mouse, we multiply the remaining cats by 3/5: 30 * (3/5) = 18.

"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different periods and calculate the cost for each period.

The first 6 months cost $8 per month, so the total cost for the first 6 months is 6 * $8 = $48.

The next 8 months cost $12 per month, so the total cost for the next 8 months is 8 * $12 = $96.

After that, the price increased to $14 per month. Since 2 years is 24 months, and we've already accounted for 14 months, there are 24 - 14 = 10 months left. The cost for the remaining 10 months is 10 * $14 = $140.

Now, let's add up the costs for all the periods: $48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let the cost of the jogger jeans be x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the cost of the tattered jeans is x + $6.

The total savings is $6, and Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. This means that 1/3 of the total savings is the savings from the jogger jeans, and 2/3 of the total savings is the savings from the tattered jeans.

The savings from the jogger jeans is 1/3 * $6 = $2. The savings from the tattered jeans is 2/3 * $6 = $4.

Since the savings from the tattered jeans is $4, the cost of the tattered jeans is $28 - $4 = $24.

Now we know that the cost of the tattered jeans is $24 and the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. So, the cost of the jogger jeans is $24 - $6 = $18.

The difference in cost between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $24 - $18 = $6.

To find the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders, we multiply the number of store-bought feeders by the number of birds they attract: 3 * 20 = 60 birds.

To find the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders, we multiply the number of homemade feeders by the number of birds they attract: 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

Now, we add the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought and homemade feeders to find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day: 60 + 90 = 150 birds.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cards Kenny sold to get the remaining $50. Since he sold the cards for $1.5 each, we can divide the remaining money by the price per card to find the number of cards sold.

Let's denote the total number of cards as 'x'. Since Kenny kept 1/3 of the cards, he sold 2/3 of the cards. The money he got from selling the cards is equal to the price per card multiplied by the number of cards sold. 

The money he got from selling the cards is $50, and the price per card is $1.5. So, we can set up the equation:

(2/3)x * 1.5 = 50

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2 to get:

x = 50 * (3/2) / 1.5
x = 50 * 3 / 3 * 2 / 1.5
x = 50 * 2 / 1.5
x = 100 / 1.5
x = 66.67

Since we can't have a fraction of a card, we round down to the nearest whole number because Kenny can't sell a fraction of a card. However, in this case, we can also consider that the cards are whole numbers, and we are looking for the total number of cards he started with. 

The total number of cards he started with is the sum of the cards he kept and the cards he sold. Since he kept 1/3 of the cards, he sold 2/3 of the cards. We already know that he sold 50 / 1.5 = 33.33 cards, but we rounded down to 33 cards because we can't sell a fraction of a card. 

However, we need to find the total number of cards he started with. Since he sold 33 cards, and we know that 33 is 2/3 of the total number of cards, we can set up the equation:

(2/3)x = 33

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2 to get:

x = 33 * (3/2)
x = 33 * 3 / 2
x = 99 / 2
x = 49.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a card, we round up to the nearest whole number because we are looking for the total number of cards he started with. 

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, the caterer prepared enough hot dogs for half of the guests to have two hot dogs. Since there are 36 guests, half of them would be 36 / 2 = 18. So, the caterer prepared enough hot dogs for 18 guests to have two hot dogs each.

This means the caterer prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hot dogs for the first 18 guests. However, since the caterer prepared enough for 18 guests to have two hot dogs, the total number of hot dogs prepared is 36.

Now, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog. This means that the 18 guests who were initially supposed to have two hot dogs got their second hot dog, and the remaining 22 guests (40 - 18 = 22) also got a second hot dog.

Since the caterer had prepared 36 hot dogs, and 40 guests got a second hot dog, there are not enough hot dogs for the 40th guest. This means that the 40th guest did not get a second hot dog.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we first need to find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Indras has 6 letters in her name. Half of 6 is 3. 

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

The total number of letters in both names is 6 (Indras) + 7 (her sister) = 13.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount and then apply the 20% discount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The set of pot and pans costs $120.00
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00
- 5 separate utensils at $5.00 each will cost 5 x $5.00 = $25.00

The total cost of the items before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Now, let's apply the 20% discount to the total cost:

20% of $165.00 is 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00

The discount amount is $33.00, so we subtract this from the total cost:

$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

The final cost of Charlotte's order is $132.00.

The final answer is: $132.00"
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and subtract the amount of money she already has.

The total cost of the items is: $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19.

Dora has a total of $2 (her allowance) + $16 (from her mother) = $18.

To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 (total cost) - $18 (amount she has) = $1.

So, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find out how many dragons Prince Bruce has slain, we need to first determine how many dragons Prince Arthur and Prince Walter have slain.

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, who slew 100 dragons. Three quarters of 100 is 75. So, Prince Arthur slew 75 dragons.

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, who slew 75 dragons. Twice of 75 is 150. So, Prince Walter slew 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, who slew 150 dragons. One-fifth of 150 is 30. So, Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to determine how much gas was in one container. Since 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, we can divide 15 gallons by 5 to find the amount in each container.

15 gallons / 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we can convert the 3 gallons to pints by multiplying 3 by 8.

3 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 24 pints

Josey needed 1/4 of a container, so we need to find 1/4 of 24 pints.

1/4 * 24 pints = 6 pints

Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George had initially. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can set up an equation to find the initial amount.

Let's denote the initial amount of money George had as 'x'. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can write the equation as:

x - 5 = 0.01x

To solve for x, we can add 5 to both sides of the equation:

x = 5 / (1 - 0.01)
x = 5 / 0.99
x = 5.05

Now that we know George had $5.05 initially, we can find out how much he spent on chips. He bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so the total amount spent on chips is:

3 * 0.40 = $1.20

Now, we can subtract the amount spent on chips from the initial amount to find out how much he spent on candy bars:

$5.05 - $1.20 = $3.85

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can divide the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar to find out how many candy bars he bought:

$3.85 / 0.75 = 5.13

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can buy 5 candy bars with $3.75 and have $0.10 left, which is not enough to buy another candy bar. Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we first need to determine how many lollipops he shared with them. 

Ray kept 5 lollipops for himself, so we subtract that from the total number of lollipops he had: 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops.

Since he shared the remaining lollipops equally with his four friends, we need to divide the number of lollipops he shared by the number of friends: 20 / 4 = 5.

So, each of his friends received 5 lollipops.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the remaining weight of the cake, we first need to determine how much of the cake was eaten. Since Rory and her mom each had a piece, that's 2 pieces in total. 

The cake was cut into 8 pieces, and 2 pieces were eaten. To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the 2 pieces eaten from the total weight of the cake.

Each piece of cake weighs 20 ounces / 8 pieces = 2.5 ounces per piece.

The weight of the 2 pieces eaten is 2.5 ounces * 2 = 5 ounces.

Now, we subtract the weight of the 2 pieces eaten from the total weight of the cake: 20 ounces - 5 ounces = 15 ounces.

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces.

15"
"To find out how many oranges each person will get, we first need to determine the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have. 

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. 

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56

Since they are sharing the oranges with 6 other friends, including themselves, the total number of people sharing the oranges is 8 (Sitti, Juris, and 6 friends).

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people.

Oranges per person = Total oranges / Total people
= 56 / 8
= 7

So, everyone will get 7 oranges. 

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the cost per serving, we first need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients. 

Antoine wants to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which costs 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Since the soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to be driven to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, Bernadette's drive will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to leave 4 + 5 = 9 minutes before Wayne.

The final numerical answer is: 9"
"To find the perimeter of Billie's room, we first need to find the width of the room. Since we know the area and the length, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length * Width.

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so 3 yards is equal to 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Now we can plug in the values into the area formula: 360 = 9 * Width. To find the width, we can divide both sides of the equation by 9: Width = 360 / 9 = 40 feet.

Now that we have the width, we can find the perimeter of the room using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width). Plugging in the values, we get: Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40) = 2 * 49 = 98 feet.

The final answer is: 98"
"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister has.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, let's find the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters:
Difference = Total beads Margareth has - Total beads Elizabeth has
= 140 - 60
= 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the final temperature of the house, we need to calculate the temperature increase due to the oven and the temperature decrease due to the open window.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour, and Marcus bakes for 3 hours. So, the total temperature increase due to the oven is 5 * 3 = 15 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the open window. The window is open for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open, so for 30 minutes, it cools down 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the final temperature of the house. The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. The temperature increase due to the oven is 15 degrees, and the temperature decrease due to the open window is 6 degrees. So, the final temperature of the house is 40 + 15 - 6 = 49 degrees.

The final answer is: 49"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took James to complete each segment of the triathlon. 

Let's start with the swim. Since James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, we need to find 10% of Jon's swim time and subtract it from Jon's swim time. 

10% of 40 minutes is 0.1 x 40 = 4 minutes. So, James finishes the swim in 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

Next, we know that James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. Jon's bike time is 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes. So, James' bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, we know that Jon won by 10 minutes. This means that the difference between James' total time and Jon's total time is 10 minutes. We can set up an equation to represent this:

Jon's total time - James' total time = 10 minutes

We know Jon's total time is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes. We also know James' swim time is 36 minutes and his bike time is 85 minutes. Let's call James' run time 'x'. Then, James' total time is 36 + 85 + x.

Now we can plug in the values into the equation:

170 - (36 + 85 + x) = 10

Combine like terms:

170 - 121 - x = 10

Subtract 170 from both sides:

-121 - x = -160

Add x to both sides:

-121 = -160 + x

Add 121 to both sides:

0 = -39 + x

Add 39 to both sides:

39 = x

So, James' run time is 39 minutes.

The final answer is: 39"
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then calculate one-fourth of that length.

Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we first need to calculate the total cost of the hay. 

First, let's find out how many miles the horse ran. Since the horse ran for 30 minutes at 32MPH, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

30 minutes is 0.5 hours (since 1 hour = 60 minutes). 

Now, we can find the distance traveled by multiplying the speed by the time: 
Distance = Speed * Time = 32MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, and it ran 16 miles, it will eat 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of the hay is 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of 6 * $5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the cost of the hay from the total amount of money Michael has: 
Change = Total money - Cost of hay = $30 - $24 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total, we need to calculate the number of eggs from the cases and the loose eggs separately. 

4 dozen eggs is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 eggs. 
Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Since each glass needs 5 eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs by 5 to find out how many glasses of eggnog Rozanne can make. 
50 eggs / 5 eggs per glass = 10 glasses.

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, so we can divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays Rozanne can put out. 
10 glasses / 5 glasses per tray = 2 trays.

The final answer is: 2"

Next, let's calculate Marcy's final score: 
Marcy's initial score: 225 points
Marcy's score after her turn: 225 + 10 = 235 points

Now, let's find the difference between Joey's and Marcy's final scores:
Difference = Joey's final score - Marcy's final score
Difference = 240 - 235
Difference = 5

So, Joey is winning by 5 points.

"To find the salesman's profit, we first need to calculate the total revenue from the flash sale and the sales to the department store.

The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each at the flash sale, so the total revenue from the flash sale is:
17 * $20 = $340

The salesman sold the remaining 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers to the department store for $25 each. The total revenue from the department store is:
31 * $25 = $775

The total revenue from both sales is:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The cost of the case of 48 sneakers is $576. To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the total revenue:
$1115 - $576 = $539

The salesman's profit is $539.

The final answer is: $539"

First, let's calculate the total number of crayons in the six packets with eight pieces each:
6 packets * 8 crayons/packet = 48 crayons

Next, let's calculate the total number of crayons in the four packets with sixteen pieces each:
4 packets * 16 crayons/packet = 64 crayons

Now, we add the total number of crayons from both types of packets to find the overall total:
48 crayons + 64 crayons = 112 crayons

The final answer is: 112"
"Let's break down the information given. 

If you buy the super ticket for $20, you get one popcorn and a soda for $1 extra. This means the total cost for the super ticket, popcorn, and soda is $21. 

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the cost of the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda without the super ticket is $21 - $2 = $19.

The cost of the movie ticket is $12, so the cost of the popcorn and soda is $19 - $12 = $7.

The cost of the soda is $3, so the cost of the popcorn is $7 - $3 = $4.

The final numerical answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as 'x'. Since the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, we can set up the equation:

20x = 900

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

x = 900 / 20
x = 45

So, the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost of filling one balloon is:

New cost = Original cost + Increase
New cost = 45 + 20
New cost = 65

Now, we need to find the total cost of filling 170 balloons at the new rate. 

Total cost = New cost per balloon * Number of balloons
Total cost = 65 * 170
Total cost = 11,050

The final answer is: 11050"
"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 mph x 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 mph x 1 hour
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's find the total distance traveled:
Total Distance = 120 miles + 30 miles
Total Distance = 150 miles

The total time taken for the trip is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

To find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average Speed = 50 mph

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires and rubies separately and then add them together.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. Each sapphire is worth $800, so the total value of her sapphires is 8 * $800 = $6400.

Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. This means she now has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left. 

The value of the 3 sapphires she traded is 3 * $800 = $2400. 

Since she traded 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, the value of the 2 rubies is also $2400. 

Now, we need to find the total value of her jewels. The value of the 5 sapphires is $6400, and the value of the 2 rubies is $2400. 

The total value of her jewels is $6400 + $2400 = $8800.

"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds. 

The volume of one raised bed is calculated as length * width * height. 
Volume = 2 feet * 8 feet * 2 feet = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:
Total Volume = 32 cubic feet/bed * 10 beds = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. To find the number of bags needed, we divide the total volume by the volume of one bag:
Number of bags = Total Volume / Volume per bag = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:
Total Cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag = 160 bags * $12/bag = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of cards, we first need to determine the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of red cards = 15
60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards

"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add the number of puppies Jennifer's dog has to the number of puppies Brandon's dog has. 

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. 
Total puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies that have spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. 
Total puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies that have spots by dividing the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and add them together.

The farmer buys 2 boxes of sugar cubes, each weighing 1 pound, so the total weight of sugar cubes is 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

The farmer buys 4 bags of carrots, each weighing 12 pounds, so the total weight of carrots is 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

The farmer buys 42 bales of hay, each weighing 75 pounds, so the total weight of hay is 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

The farmer buys 20 sacks of oats, each weighing 65 pounds, so the total weight of oats is 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

The total weight of all the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds.

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight of the feed by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips needed.

3400 / 2250 = 1.511 (round up to the nearest whole number since we can't make a fraction of a trip)

So, the farmer needs 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from aluminum cans. Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week. Since an aluminum can is worth 2 cents, her weekly earnings from aluminum cans are 3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week. 

For a four-week month, her earnings from aluminum cans would be 6 cents/week * 4 weeks = 24 cents.

Next, let's calculate her earnings from plastic bottles. Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week. Since a plastic bottle is worth 3 cents, her weekly earnings from plastic bottles are 5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week.

For a four-week month, her earnings from plastic bottles would be 15 cents/week * 4 weeks = 60 cents.

Now, let's add her earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles to find her total earnings for a four-week month: 24 cents + 60 cents = 84 cents.

"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we need to first determine how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate Toni's plants as follows:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find out how many plants Shondra has. Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, so:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

"To find out how many students Miss Maria has, we first need to calculate the total number of cards she has. 

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, so the total number of basketball cards is 6 * 25 = 150.

She has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200.

The total number of cards is the sum of basketball and baseball cards, which is 150 + 200 = 350.

Since Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, the number of cards she gives to her students is 350 - 50 = 300.

Each student gets 10 cards, so the number of students is 300 / 10 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples for both of them.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each and received a $1 discount. 
First, we calculate the total cost of the apples for Becky: 20 * 0.45 = $9. 
Then, we subtract the discount: $9 - $1 = $8.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each and received a 10 percent discount. 
First, we calculate the total cost of the apples for Kelly: 20 * 0.50 = $10.
Then, we calculate the discount: 10% of $10 is 0.1 * $10 = $1.
Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $10 - $1 = $9.

Now, we compare the costs: $9 (Kelly) - $8 (Becky) = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find the total number of pieces of laundry, we need to calculate the number of each type of laundry per room and then multiply it by the total number of rooms.

Each room has:
- 2 sheets
- 1 comforter
- Twice as many pillow cases as sheets: 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases
- Twice as many towels as pillow cases: 2 * 4 = 8 towels

So, the total number of laundry per room is: 2 (sheets) + 1 (comforter) + 4 (pillow cases) + 8 (towels) = 15

Now, we multiply the total number of laundry per room by the total number of rooms: 15 * 80 = 1200

The final answer is: 1200"
"To find the total number of shoes Fireman Frank has on Sunday, we need to calculate the total number of shoes he has after gaining new pairs and then subtract the shoes he gets rid of on Saturday.

First, let's find the total number of shoes he has after gaining new pairs:

- Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes.
- He gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday, which is 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.
- He gains 15 new pairs on Wednesday, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.
- He gains 30 new pairs on Friday, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.

Now, let's add the shoes he already had to the new shoes he gained:
200 + 10 + 30 + 60 = 300 shoes.

However, he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday. To find the total number of shoes he has on Sunday, we subtract the shoes he got rid of from the total:
300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how many pans of cupcakes Mary should bake, we first need to determine the total number of cupcakes she can decorate with her sprinkles. Since each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and she has 6 jars, we multiply the number of jars by the number of cupcakes per jar.

6 jars * 8 cupcakes/jar = 48 cupcakes

Now, we need to find out how many pans of cupcakes she should bake. Each pan holds 12 cupcakes, so we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes per pan.

48 cupcakes / 12 cupcakes/pan = 4 pans

So, Mary should bake 4 pans of cupcakes to use up all of her sprinkles.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the cost of the piece of paper, we need to calculate three times the price of the pen, which is 3 * $2 = $6. Since the piece of paper costs $1 less than this, its cost is $6 - $1 = $5.

The total cost of the pen and the paper is $2 + $5 = $7. 

Since Theo gave the cashier $10, the change she received is $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many pencils were used in total. 

Initially, there are 30 students, each with 10 pencils. So, the total number of pencils is 30 * 10 = 300.

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. This means 1/5 * 300 = 60 pencils were used.

So, the remaining pencils after two months are 300 - 60 = 240.

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. This means 1/3 * 240 = 80 pencils were left.

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's break down the problem. Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is 'x'. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be represented as 0.5x + 2.

Since Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, we can set up the equation: 0.5x + 2 = 5.

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable. First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: 0.5x = 5 - 2, which simplifies to 0.5x = 3.

Next, divide both sides of the equation by 0.5 to solve for 'x': x = 3 / 0.5.

x = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert their individual lengths to feet and then add them together. 

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 6 inches to feet by dividing by 12. 

6 inches / 12 = 0.5 feet

Since there are two remoras, we multiply the length of one remora by 2.

0.5 feet * 2 = 1 foot

Now, we add the length of the remoras to the length of the shark.

10 feet (shark) + 1 foot (remoras) = 11 feet

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy, we divide the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100.

(1 foot / 10 feet) * 100 = 10%

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of students, we need to determine the number of students with desktop computers and then add the number of students without desktop computers.

Since three-fourths of the students have desktop computers, one-fourth of the students do not have desktop computers. We know that 20 students do not have desktop computers, which represents one-fourth of the total number of students.

Let's set up an equation to find the total number of students:

1/4 * Total number of students = 20

To find the total number of students, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

Total number of students = 20 * 4
Total number of students = 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To find out how many days Jason has to break in the shoes, we need to multiply the number of days he has (21 days, since there are 7 days in a week and he has 3 weeks) by the number of days he walks per week (4 days). 

21 days * 4 days/week = 84 days

Since it takes 240 minutes to break in the shoes, we need to divide the total number of days by the number of days he walks per week to find out how many days he has to walk to break in the shoes. However, we actually need to find out how many minutes he has to walk each day.

To find the total number of minutes he has to walk, we multiply the number of days he has to break in the shoes by the number of minutes it takes to break in the shoes per day. 

Since he walks 4 days a week, we need to divide the total minutes by 4 to find the daily minutes.

"To find out how many books each child got, we need to first determine the total number of books Sarah bought. Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can divide the total amount spent by the cost of each book.

Total amount spent = $300
Cost of each book = $15

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost of each book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by 4 to find out how many books each child got.

Number of books per child = Total number of books / 4
Number of books per child = 20 / 4
Number of books per child = 5

"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to first find the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts. 

We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find this. The formula is Total = A + B - Both, where A is the number of kids allergic to dairy, B is the number of kids allergic to peanuts, and Both is the number of kids allergic to both.

A = 9 (kids allergic to dairy)
B = 6 (kids allergic to peanuts)
Both = 3 (kids allergic to both)

Total allergic = A + B - Both = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12

Now, we know that there are 32 kids in the class. To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we subtract the total number of kids allergic from the total number of kids in the class.

Kids not allergic = Total kids - Total allergic = 32 - 12 = 20

"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to calculate the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides.

First, let's calculate the total number of employees: 
There are 3 groups of 200 employees each, so the total number of employees is 3 * 200 = 600.

Next, let's calculate the total number of tour guides: 
There are 3 groups, and each group has 7 tour guides, so the total number of tour guides is 3 * 7 = 21.

Now, let's add the total number of employees and tour guides to find the total number of people going on the tour: 
Total number of people = Total number of employees + Total number of tour guides
Total number of people = 600 + 21
Total number of people = 621

"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than normal, so we need to find 20% of the normal price and add it to the normal price. 20% of $1500 is 0.2 * $1500 = $300. The hotel price is $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the cost of the plane tickets plus the cost of the hotel, which is $10,000 + $5400 = $16,400.

The final answer is: $16,400"

Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint. Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so Jasper has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

To find the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we add the number of blue and yellow tubes: 2 (blue) + 9 (yellow) = 11.

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to find the weight of the 2010 penny. 

Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight by multiplying the weight of the 1959 penny by 3/4.

Weight of 1959 penny = 48 grains
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48 grains
Weight of 2010 penny = 36 grains

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their individual weights.

Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny
Combined weight = 48 grains + 36 grains
Combined weight = 84 grains

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how much more they need to earn, we need to calculate the total amount they have already earned and subtract that from their goal.

Keegan earned $83 and Tasha earned $91, so together they earned $83 + $91 = $174.

Their goal is to raise $200, so we subtract the amount they have already earned from the goal: $200 - $174 = $26.

They need to earn $26 more to reach their goal.

The final answer is: $26"
"To find out how many songs Luri can add to his player, we need to first determine how many songs he currently has. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, Luri has 3 * 20 = 60 songs.

The maximum capacity of the player is 100 songs. To find out how many more songs Luri can add, we subtract the number of songs he already has from the maximum capacity: 100 - 60 = 40.

Now, we need to find out how many more songs Gabriel can add. Since Gabriel has 20 songs, he can add 100 - 20 = 80 more songs.

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add than Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add: 80 - 40 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we first need to find out how many oranges he ate. Since Stetson ate 2/5 of the oranges and they picked 60 oranges, we can calculate the number of oranges he ate as follows:

Number of oranges eaten = (2/5) * 60
= (2 * 60) / 5
= 120 / 5
= 24

Since Stetson gave up $10 for each orange he ate, we can multiply the number of oranges he ate by the amount he gave up per orange:

Total amount given up = Number of oranges eaten * Amount per orange
= 24 * 10
= 240

The final answer is: $240"
"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we need to first calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes. 

3 times the cost of her shoes is 3 * $80 = $240.

Since her handbag cost $20 less than 3 times as much as her shoes, we need to subtract $20 from $240.

$240 - $20 = $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"To find out how many hours James runs a week, we need to first calculate the total miles he runs in a week. Since he runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week, we multiply the miles per day by the number of days:

12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Next, we need to find out how many hours he runs in a week. We know he runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. To find the total hours, we divide the total miles by the speed:

60 miles/week Ã· 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week

So, James runs 6 hours a week. 

6"
"To determine the total amount of oats needed, we first need to calculate the daily consumption of oats by Uncle Ben's horses. 

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and there are two meals per day, so each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has four horses, the total daily consumption is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds of oats per day.

For five days, the total consumption would be 40 * 5 = 200 pounds of oats.

Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats, so to find out how many bags are needed, we divide the total consumption by the weight of each bag: 200 / 50 = 4.

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the number of girl Pomeranians, we first need to find the total number of Pomeranians. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can calculate this as follows:

Total puppies = 27
Pomeranians = (2/3) * Total puppies
Pomeranians = (2/3) * 27
Pomeranians = 18

Now, we need to find the number of girl Pomeranians. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can calculate this as follows:

Girl Pomeranians = (1/3) * Pomeranians
Girl Pomeranians = (1/3) * 18
Girl Pomeranians = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the average highest temperature, we need to add up the highest temperatures of the three countries and divide by 3.

First, let's add up the temperatures: 
-48 (Southlandia) + 21 (Northlandia) + (-3) (Midlandia) = -30

Now, let's divide the sum by 3:
-30 / 3 = -10

The average highest temperature of the three countries is -10 degrees Fahrenheit."
"To find out how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we need to first calculate the remaining amount he needs to save. 

The toy car costs $12, and he already has $4. So, the remaining amount he needs to save is $12 - $4 = $8.

He promises to save $2 daily from his allowance. To find out how many days it will take to save $8, we can divide the remaining amount by the daily savings.

$8 / $2 = 4

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money. 

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we need to calculate the total number of eggs that can fit on the two trays and subtract that from the total number of eggs he has.

Each tray can hold 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays. So, the total number of eggs that can fit on the trays is 24 * 2 = 48.

Jaime has 64 eggs, and 48 can fit on the trays. To find out how many won't fit, we subtract 48 from 64: 64 - 48 = 16.

So, Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the tray.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total amount Sally spent, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza first. Since it costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, we multiply the cost of the small pizza by 3.

Cost of small pizza: $8
Cost of family-size pizza: $8 * 3 = $24

Now, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount spent.

Total amount spent: $8 + $24 = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"To find the cost per individual razor after the discount, we need to first calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon.

Since the razors are buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. 

Heather also has a $2.00 coupon, so she will get a discount of $2.00.

The total cost of 1 pack of razors with the coupon is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, the cost per individual razor is $2.00 / 4 = $0.50.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents.

Since Heather buys 2 packs, we need to multiply the cost per individual razor by 8 (2 packs * 4 razors per pack): 50 cents * 8 = 400 cents.

However, the question asks for the cost per individual razor, not the total cost for 8 razors. Therefore, the cost per individual razor is 50 cents.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each level and add them up.

The 4 girls on the bottom are 64"" tall each. 
4 * 64"" = 256""

The 3 girls on top of the 4 are also 64"" tall each. 
3 * 64"" = 192""

The 2 girls on top of the 3 are also 64"" tall each. 
2 * 64"" = 128""

The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, let's add up the heights of each level:
256"" + 192"" = 448""
448"" + 128"" = 576""
576"" + 60"" = 636""

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
636"" / 12 = 53 feet

The final answer is: 53"
"To find the total number of minutes Charisma walked, we need to calculate the total number of 5-minute breaks she took in a day and then multiply it by the number of days she worked.

Charisma works 8 hours a day and takes a 5-minute break every hour. So, she takes 8 breaks per day. 

8 breaks per day * 5 minutes per break = 40 minutes per day

Since Charisma worked for 5 days, we multiply the daily breaks by the number of days:

40 minutes per day * 5 days = 200 minutes

The final answer is: 200"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know that in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is 14 years old now, in four years, he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.

We are told that in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. This means that in four years, Angela's age will be 3 * 14 = 42 years old.

Since we know Angela's age in four years, we can find her current age by subtracting 4 from 42. So, Angela's current age is 42 - 4 = 38 years old.

The final numerical answer is: 38"
"To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides separately, and then add them together.

The cost of the morning rides is the cost per ride multiplied by the number of rides. Since Paul drives twice a day for 14 days, he drives a total of 2 * 14 = 28 rides in the morning. The cost per ride is $6, so the total cost of the morning rides is 28 * $6 = $168.

The cost of the afternoon rides is also the cost per ride multiplied by the number of rides. Since Paul drives twice a day for 14 days, he drives a total of 2 * 14 = 28 rides in the afternoon. The cost per ride is $2, so the total cost of the afternoon rides is 28 * $2 = $56.

To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we add the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides: $168 + $56 = $224.

The final answer is: $224"
"Let's break down the information given. Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so she has a total of 5 * 10 = 50 oranges. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

In total, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges. Since one Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, the number of pies they can make is 120 / 3 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the costs for each venue. 

For the first venue, the cost is a flat fee of $200, plus $5 per guest. If there are x guests, the total cost for the first venue is $200 + $5x.

For the second venue, the cost is $25 per guest. If there are x guests, the total cost for the second venue is $25x.

Since we want the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up the equation:

$200 + $5x = $25x

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting $5x from both sides:

$200 = $20x

Now, we can divide both sides by $20 to solve for x:

x = $200 / $20
x = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Let's denote the number of insects David found as D, the number of insects Bodhi found as B, and the number of insects Lily found as L. 

From the problem, we know that L = D + 7 (Lily found 7 more than David). 
We also know that D = B/2 (David found half of what Bodhi found). 
And we know that L + D + B = 43 (Together they collected 43 insects).

We can substitute the first equation into the third equation to get (D + 7) + D + B = 43. 
This simplifies to 2D + B + 7 = 43. 

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the simplified equation to get 2(D) + B + 7 = 43. 
This becomes 2(B/2) + B + 7 = 43. 
This simplifies to B + B + 7 = 43. 
This becomes 2B + 7 = 43. 

Now, we can solve for B by subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation to get 2B = 36. 
Dividing both sides by 2 gives us B = 18. 

Now that we know B, we can find D by substituting B into the equation D = B/2. 
D = 18/2 = 9. 

Now that we know D, we can find L by substituting D into the equation L = D + 7. 
L = 9 + 7 = 16.

"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to calculate the yards used by Mariah and her grandma separately and then add them together.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein. To find 1/4 of 364, we multiply 364 by 1/4 (which is the same as dividing by 4).

364 yards / 4 = 91 yards

So, Mariah used 91 yards of yarn.

Mariah's grandma used 1/2 of a skein, which is the same as 2/4. To find 2/4 of 364, we multiply 364 by 2 and then divide by 4.

364 * 2 = 728
728 / 4 = 182 yards

So, Mariah's grandma used 182 yards of yarn.

Now, let's add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma together.

91 yards (Mariah) + 182 yards (grandma) = 273 yards

The final answer is: 273"
"To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the number of gifts for her friends and add the 10 random gifts.

First, let's calculate the number of gifts for her friends. 2 friends want 5 gifts each, so that's 2 x 5 = 10 gifts. The other 3 friends want 2 gifts each, so that's 3 x 2 = 6 gifts. 

Now, let's add the gifts for her friends: 10 + 6 = 16 gifts.

Finally, we add the 10 random gifts: 16 + 10 = 26 gifts.

The total number of gifts Cherrie bought is 26."
"To find the length of the couch, we first need to find the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, and the chair is 3 feet wide, the rug's width is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. Adding 2 feet to this gives us the length of the couch: 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's break down the information given. Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total. She bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, 1 pack of grape gum for $2, and 1 pack of green apple gum. 

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as 'x'. Since she paid half as much for the green apple gum as for the grape gum, the cost of the green apple gum is $2 / 2 = $1.

The total cost of all the gum is $7. So, the total cost of the strawberry gum and the green apple gum is $7 - $2 = $5. 

Since there are 2 packs of strawberry gum, the total cost of the strawberry gum is 2x. The total cost of the green apple gum is $1. Therefore, 2x + $1 = $5.

To find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we need to solve for x. Subtracting $1 from both sides of the equation gives us 2x = $4. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us x = $2.

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2. 

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives him the most sticks per dollar spent. 

First, let's calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood:

For a 2 x 4, Frederick gets 200 sticks for $4. 
Cost per stick = $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick

For a 2 x 8, Frederick gets 400 sticks for $6.
Cost per stick = $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick

Since the 2 x 8 costs less per stick, we should prioritize buying 2 x 8 lumber. 

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy with his $24:

Number of 2 x 8 pieces = $24 / $6 = 4

Since each 2 x 8 piece gives 400 sticks, the total number of sticks Frederick can make is:

Total sticks = 4 * 400 = 1600

However, we need to check if buying 2 x 4 pieces would give him more sticks. 

Number of 2 x 4 pieces = $24 / $4 = 6

Since each 2 x 4 piece gives 200 sticks, the total number of sticks Frederick can make is:

Total sticks = 6 * 200 = 1200

Comparing the two options, buying 2 x 8 pieces gives him more sticks. 

The final answer is: 1600"
"To find the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs, we first need to determine the total number of snowshoes required. Since each dog has four legs and Mario has 6 dogs, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24.

Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, and each pair has two snowshoes, the total number of snowshoes required is 24 / 2 = 12.

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of snowshoes by the cost per pair, which is $12.00. 

Total cost = 12 * $12.00 = $144.00

The final answer is: $144.00"
"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we first need to calculate how much she spends on bus trips in a week. 

Janet takes two bus trips a day, five days a week. So, the total number of bus trips in a week is 2 * 5 = 10 trips.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost of bus trips in a week is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

Now, if Janet buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save $22 - $20 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the information given:

- The farm has 30 cows.
- The zoo has 20 sheep.
- The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.
- The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.
- The zoo has 20 sheep and 60 cows, so the zoo has a total of 20 + 60 = 80 animals.
- The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, so the farm has a total of 30 + 10 = 40 animals.

To find the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo, we add the number of animals in the farm and the zoo: 40 + 80 = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can represent the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought as x.

The total number of onions and potatoes Rose bought is 12 + 4 = 16. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can set up the equation 4x = 16.

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 16 / 4 = 4.

So, Sophia bought 4 onions and 4 potatoes. 

The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 4 + 4 = 8."
"To determine the calorie deficit Andy needs each day, we first need to calculate the total number of days he has to reach his goal. 

Since Andy's birthday is on July 19th and today is December 31st, we can calculate the number of days as follows:

December has 31 days, so from December 31st to December 31st is 31 days.
January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days.
February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year), so from February 1st to February 28th is 28 days.
March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days.
April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 30th is 30 days.
May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 31st is 31 days.
June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 30th is 30 days.
July has 19 days, so from July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Total number of days = 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 201 days

Now, we can calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to reach his goal:

Total calories to burn = 30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories by the number of days:

Daily calorie deficit = Total calories to burn / Total number of days
= 105,000 calories / 201 days
= approximately 522 calories per day

The final answer is: $\boxed{522}$"
"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate his total earnings for the week and then subtract the amount he spent.

Since Gerald works for a week, which has 7 days, and he earns $30 per day, we can calculate his total earnings as follows:

Total earnings = Daily earnings * Number of days worked
Total earnings = $30 * 7
Total earnings = $210

Now, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings to find out how much he has left:

Amount left = Total earnings - Amount spent
Amount left = $210 - $100
Amount left = $110

So, Gerald has $110 left."
"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total distance she will run. Since each lap is 0.25 km and she needs to run 8 laps, we multiply the number of laps by the distance per lap.

Total distance = 8 laps * 0.25 km/lap = 2 km

Since Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs, we multiply the total distance by the amount of water needed per kilometer.

Total water needed = 2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml

Therefore, Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. We also know that the house cost three times as much as the lot. 

Let's represent the cost of the lot as 'x'. Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write the equation: x + 3x = 120,000.

Combine like terms: 4x = 120,000.

Divide both sides by 4: x = 30,000.

Since the cost of the lot is $30,000, the cost of the house is 3 times that, which is 3 * 30,000 = $90,000.

The final answer is: $90,000."
"To find the profit, we first need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The total cost is the cost of the canvas bags, which is 8 packs * 5 bags per pack * $4 per bag = 8 * 5 * 4 = $160.

The total revenue is the selling price of the bags, which is 8 bags * $8 per bag = 8 * 8 = $64.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $64 - $160 = -$96.

However, since profit cannot be negative, it seems there might be an error in the given information. If the selling price is less than the cost, then Tara would have actually incurred a loss.

But if we assume that the question is asking for the profit in terms of the difference between the selling price and the cost, then the profit per bag is $8 - $4 = $4. The total profit would be 8 bags * $4 per bag = $32.

Josh's cookies = Suzanne's cookies / 4
Josh's cookies = 36 / 4
Josh's cookies = 9

Now that we know Josh made 9 cookies, we can find out how many Kelsie made. Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, so we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. First, we need to find the total amount of money he has. 

Four $10 bills will be 4 x $10 = $40. 
Six $20 bills will be 6 x $20 = $120. 
The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives his sister half of the total money he has. Half of $160 is $160 / 2 = $80. So, Ali gives his sister $80.

Now, Ali has $160 - $80 = $80 left.

Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. 3/5 of $80 is (3/5) x $80 = $48.

So, he has 88 - 36 = 52 problems left.

On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining math problems, which is 1/4 * 52 = 13 problems. 
So, he has 52 - 13 = 39 problems left.

Therefore, Chris has 39 math problems left to complete on Thursday. 

The final answer is: 39"
"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Kathy, and Ricky can pick per hour, we need to calculate the individual rates of each person and then add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add the individual rates together to find the total number of quarts of strawberries that they can pick per hour: 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29.

The final answer is: 29"
"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakers had left, we need to subtract the number of loaves sold and returned from the total number of loaves baked.

First, let's calculate the total number of loaves sold: 
93 (morning) + 39 (afternoon) = 132 loaves sold

Now, let's add the number of loaves returned to the number sold: 
132 (sold) + 6 (returned) = 138 loaves

Now, we subtract the total number of loaves sold and returned from the initial number of loaves baked: 
200 (initial loaves) - 138 (loaves sold and returned) = 62 loaves

The bakers had 62 loaves of bread left.

"To find the number of rows of red tulips, we need to divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row. 

36 red tulips / 6 tulips per row = 6 rows of red tulips.

To find the number of rows of blue tulips, we need to divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row.

24 blue tulips / 8 tulips per row = 3 rows of blue tulips.

Since Jackson can plant both red and blue tulips in the same row, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of rows of red and blue tulips to determine the total number of rows he can plant.

The LCM of 6 and 3 is 6.

Therefore, Jackson can plant 6 rows of flowers. 

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we first need to determine how many cups of raisins she has available for the oatmeal cookies. 

Since she divides the raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, we can divide the total number of cups of raisins by 3. 

Total cups of raisins = 27 cups
Cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies = Total cups of raisins / 3
Cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies = 27 / 3
Cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies = 9 cups

Now, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make with 9 cups of raisins. Each batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. 

Number of batches = Cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies / Cups of raisins per batch
Number of batches = 9 / (3/4)
To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal.
Number of batches = 9 * (4/3)
Number of batches = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we first need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device.

Before adding the new device, Ada's daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, her daily consumption in dollars is:
12 kilowatts/hour * $1.50/kilowatt/hour = $18/day

Her weekly consumption before adding the new device is:
$18/day * 7 days/week = $126/week

After adding the new device, her daily consumption will be:
12 kilowatts/hour + 2 kilowatts/hour = 14 kilowatts/hour

Her daily consumption in dollars after adding the new device is:
14 kilowatts/hour * $1.50/kilowatt/hour = $21/day

Her weekly consumption after adding the new device is:
$21/day * 7 days/week = $147/week

The difference in her weekly electric bill is:
$147/week - $126/week = $21/week

The final answer is: $21"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how long it would take one person to paint a whole house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, it would take them 10 days to paint a whole house (since it's twice the amount of work).

Now, let's calculate the total hours it would take one person to paint a whole house. There are 24 hours in a day, so:

10 days * 24 hours/day = 240 hours

Since one person can paint a whole house in 240 hours, we need to find out how long it would take 5 people to paint a whole house. If 5 people can work together, they can complete the same amount of work in less time. To find the time it would take 5 people to paint a whole house, we divide the total hours it would take one person by 5:

240 hours / 5 people = 48 hours

So, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

The final answer is: 48"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.
4. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have:

Ophelia's sofas: 20
Ophelia's chairs: 22
Jenna's sofas: 64
Jenna's chairs: 66

Total number of sofas: 20 + 64 = 84
Total number of chairs: 22 + 66 = 88

The total number of sofas and chairs is 84 + 88 = 172."
"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought, we first need to determine the cost of the headphone set. 

Let's subtract the cost of the CD from the total amount Tom paid: $48 - $4 = $44. 

This is the cost of the headphone set. 

Now, we can find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he saved by not buying the headphone set. 

The cost of one CD is $4. 

To find out how many CDs Tom could have bought, we divide the cost of the headphone set by the cost of one CD: $44 / $4 = 11.

So, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to consider the weeks where he spent 4 hours, 5 hours, and 6 hours. 

First, let's find the total hours spent in the weeks where he spent 4 hours each. Since there are 6 weeks where he spent 4 hours, the total hours spent in these weeks is 6 * 4 = 24 hours.

Next, let's find the total hours spent in the weeks where he spent 5 hours each. Since there are 2 weeks where he spent 5 hours, the total hours spent in these weeks is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

Then, let's find the total hours spent in the week where he spent 6 hours.

Now, we need to find the total hours spent in the remaining weeks. Since there are 8 weeks in total and we have already accounted for 8 hours in the weeks where he spent 5 hours each, we have 8 - 2 = 6 weeks left. In these weeks, Josh spent 4 hours each, so the total hours spent in these weeks is 6 * 4 = 24 hours.

Now, we can find the total hours spent in the week where he spent 6 hours. This is simply 6 hours.

Now, we can add up the total hours spent in all the weeks: 24 + 10 + 6 + 24 = 64 hours.

The total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is 64."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left on the bus is:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (which is 8) get into the bus. So, 5 * 8 = 40 people get in. Now, the total number of passengers on the bus is:
40 (left) + 40 (got in) = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left on the bus is:
80 - 21 = 59

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. Since 3 times fewer means 1/3 of the number of passengers who got off, we need to find 1/3 of 21:
21 / 3 = 7

So, 7 passengers get in. Now, the total number of passengers on the bus is:
59 (left) + 7 (got in) = 66

The final answer is: 66"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.
2. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. 
   Jame's age in 8 years will be 22 + 8 = 30 years.
   Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60 years.
   So, Jame's cousin's age in 8 years will be 60 - 5 = 55 years.
3. Since Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, his current age is 55 - 8 = 47 years.

Now, let's find the difference in their current ages: 47 (cousin's age) - 22 (Jame's age) = 25 years.

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break down the information given. 

The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400. The computer costs $1,100. 

Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, the cost of the printer is $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, let's find the total cost of the computer and the printer. 
Computer cost: $1,100
Printer cost: $700
Total cost of computer and printer: $1,100 + $700 = $1,800

Since the total cost of all items is $2,400, the cost of the 2 monitors is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the monitors by 2. 
Cost of one monitor: $600 / 2 = $300

The final answer is: $300"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many shells the boys brought in total. Since there are 10 boys (half of 20 kids) and each brought 60 shells, the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

Now, we know that the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + 4 * 60 shells.

First, we calculate 4 times the number of shells brought by the boys: 4 * 60 = 240.

Then, we add this to the number of shells brought by the boys: 600 + 240 = 840.

Since there are 10 girls (half of 20 kids), we need to find out how many shells each girl brought. To do this, we divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by the number of girls: 840 / 10 = 84.

The final answer is: 84"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, let's assume the number of candies George had before eating 5 candies is 'x'. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, the number of candies Nick had is 2x.

George ate 5 candies, so the number of candies George has left is x - 5. We are given that George has 3 candies left, so we can set up the equation:

x - 5 = 3

To solve for x, we add 5 to both sides of the equation:

x = 3 + 5
x = 8

Now that we know George had 8 candies initially, we can find the number of candies Nick had, which is 2x:

Number of candies Nick had = 2x
= 2 * 8
= 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find Anne's age, we first need to find Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, Alyana's age is 10 - 4 = 6 years.

Now, we know that Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so Anne's age is 6 + 2 = 8 years.

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it's 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it's 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together: 
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188

The final answer is: 188"
"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we need to calculate the total number of vlogs she has already made and subtract that from the target of 72.

Emma made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. 

Total vlogs made = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Since Emma's target is 72 vlogs, we subtract the total vlogs made from the target to find out how many more vlogs she needs to make.

Vlogs needed = 72 - 54 = 18

So, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete her target of 72 vlogs per month.

"To find the total amount you paid, we need to calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill and then add it to the bill.

First, let's calculate the 20% tip:

20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10

Now, let's add the tip to the bill:

$50 (bill) + $10 (tip) = $60

So, you ended up paying $60.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money the eldest boy initially received. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, we divide $18 by 3 to find the initial share of the eldest boy.

Initial share of the eldest boy = $18 / 3 = $6

The eldest boy added $5 to his share, so his new total is:

$6 + $5 = $11

The following day, he added another $10, making his total:

$11 + $10 = $21

Then, he spent $8 from his total, leaving him with:

$21 - $8 = $13

After saving some more, he tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8. To find the final amount, we multiply $13 by 3:

$13 * 3 = $39

So, the eldest boy now has $39."
"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how much Elvis needs to save in the first half of the month. 

Let's assume the number of days in the first half of April is x. Since April has 30 days, the number of days in the second half will also be x. 

The total number of days in April is 30, so x + x = 30. 
Solving for x, we get 2x = 30, x = 15. 

So, the first half of April has 15 days and the second half also has 15 days.

Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half. Let's assume he saves y dollars in the first half. Then, he will save 2y dollars in the second half.

The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings in the first and second half: y + 2y = 1125.

Combine like terms: 3y = 1125.

Divide both sides by 3: y = 375.

So, Elvis needs to save 375 dollars in the first half of the month.

Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, he will save 2y = 2 * 375 = 750 dollars in the second half.

Jairus gets $0.8 for each task, so for 20 tasks, he will get 20 * $0.8 = $16.

Jenny gets $0.5 for each task, so for 20 tasks, she will get 20 * $0.5 = $10.

Now, we need to find the difference between what Jairus and Jenny get. 

$16 (Jairus) - $10 (Jenny) = $6

"Let's break down the problem. We know that Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, and the total amount they have to divide is $100.

Let's represent the amount Brad gets as 'x'. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, the amount Jeff gets is 4x.

The total amount they have to divide is $100, so we can set up the equation: x + 4x = 100.

Combine like terms: 5x = 100.

Now, divide both sides by 5 to solve for x: x = 20.

Since x represents the amount Brad gets, and Jeff gets 4 times as much, Jeff gets 4x = 4(20) = 80.

The final answer is: $80"
"To find the total miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

Since Jeff walks to work and back each day, the total miles he walks each day is 2 times the distance to work, which is 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles.

Now, we multiply the daily miles by the number of days he works in a week: 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the process step by step.

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, which means she writes 26 letters each time. So, in total, she writes 26 * 2 = 52 letters.

2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of the alphabet is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.

3. So, in total, she has written 52 + 13 = 65 letters so far.

4. Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written. This means she re-writes 65 letters.

5. To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we add the letters she wrote initially (52) to the letters she wrote in the second step (13) and the letters she re-wrote (65). 

Total letters = 52 + 13 + 65 = 130

"This problem can be solved using a geometric progression. 

In the first round, 3 families are notified directly by Ali. 

In the second round, each of the 3 families notifies 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families notified. 

In the third round, each of the 9 families notifies 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families notified.

To find the number of families notified in the fourth round, we need to find the number of families that were notified in the third round, which is 27, and multiply it by 3. 

So, in the fourth round, 27 * 3 = 81 families will be notified.

"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost and then add that to his final weight.

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so the total weight he lost is:
10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Since Mark's final weight is 70 pounds, we can find his initial weight by adding the weight he lost to his final weight:
Initial weight = Final weight + Weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Jonathan needs to have a play set five times larger than James's. Since James's play set has 80 toys, a play set five times larger would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys.

Since Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a play set five times larger than James's, we can set up an equation: x + 2 = 400, where x is the number of toys Jonathan currently has.

To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 2 from both sides: x = 400 - 2.

x = 398

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys."
"To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we first need to calculate the cost of each item without the discount. 

The cost of 5 notebooks at $1.50 each is 5 x $1.50 = $7.50.
The cost of 2 pens at $0.25 each is 2 x $0.25 = $0.50.
The cost of 1 calculator at $12 each is $12.
The cost of 1 geometry set at $10 each is $10.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

Since the shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
10% of $30 is 0.1 x $30 = $3.

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost: $30 - $3 = $27.

So, Daniel has to spend $27 on all the items he wants to buy.

"To determine how many additional bottles Bill needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles he already has. Since he started with 2 cases of water, each containing 24 bottles, we multiply the number of cases by the number of bottles per case: 2 * 24 = 48 bottles.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of bottles Bill needs for his party. He has 70 guests and wants 2 bottles per guest, so we multiply the number of guests by the number of bottles per guest: 70 * 2 = 140 bottles.

Now, we subtract the number of bottles Bill already has from the total number of bottles he needs: 140 - 48 = 92 bottles.

So, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water for his party.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. 

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as in cold water. Since it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile in cold water, twice that time is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. Adding 2 minutes to that gives us 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water. 

In cold water, it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile, so to swim 3 miles it will take him 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.

In warm water, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile, so to swim 3 miles it will take him 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

Now, we need to find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm and cold water.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many cups of coffee Octavia drinks. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, and we don't know the daily recommended amount, let's call it 'x'. 

Octavia's coffee intake = x / 2

We are given that Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks. 

Juan's coffee intake = 10 * (x / 2) = 5x

We are also given that Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. 

To find out how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we need to subtract the recommended amount from his current intake.

Reduction in coffee intake = 5x - 4

However, we still need to find the value of 'x'. Since we don't have any information about the daily recommended amount of coffee, we can assume that the question is asking for a relative reduction, not an absolute amount. 

In that case, we can express the reduction as a fraction of Juan's current intake. 

Reduction in coffee intake = (5x - 4) / 5x

To simplify this expression, we can factor out 'x' from the numerator and denominator.

Reduction in coffee intake = (5x - 4) / 5x = (5x/5x - 4/5x) = 1 - 4/5x

However, we still need to find the value of 'x'. Since we don't have any information about the daily recommended amount of coffee, we can assume that the question is asking for a general reduction, not a specific amount. 

In that case, we can express the reduction as a fraction of the daily recommended amount. 

Reduction in coffee intake = 1 - 4/5 = 1/5

Since the question asks for the number of cups, we can express the reduction as a fraction of the daily recommended amount.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\frac{1}{5}}$"
"To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the total number of hamsters: 
There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, so the total number of hamsters is 3 * 10 = 30.

Next, let's find the total number of guinea pigs: 
There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so the total number of guinea pigs is 3 * 5 = 15.

Now, let's add the total number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents: 
Total rodents = Total hamsters + Total guinea pigs
Total rodents = 30 + 15
Total rodents = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the average weight of the three friends, we first need to find their individual weights. 

Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds. 
Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so Susan's weight is 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. 
Bob's weight is twice as much as Susan's, so Bob's weight is 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we need to find the average weight of the three friends. To do this, we add their weights and divide by 3. 
Average weight = (Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight) / 3 
Average weight = (150 + 130 + 260) / 3 
Average weight = 540 / 3 
Average weight = 180 

The final answer is: 180"
"To find the final angle of the sun from the ground, we need to calculate the total angle the sun moves in 10 hours. 

The sun moves 5 degrees per hour, so in 10 hours, it will move 5 * 10 = 50 degrees.

Since the pyramids are initially at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground, we need to add the angle the sun moves to this initial angle.

So, the final angle from the ground to the sun will be 32 + 50 = 82 degrees.

The final answer is: 82"
"To find out how many packs of candles James needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of candles required. Since James has two sons, one 12 years old and the other 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Typically, birthday candles are used in the number equal to the age of the person. So, James will need 12 candles for the older son and 8 candles for the younger son, making a total of 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total number of candles needed (20) by the number of candles in a pack (5). 

20 / 5 = 4

So, James needs to buy 4 packs of candles. 

The cost of 4 packs of candles is 4 * $3 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she read in the first week and then convert that to pages. 

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Given that Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes. First, let's find out how many 1.5-minute intervals are in 105 minutes. We can do this by dividing 105 by 1.5, which equals 70. 

Now, we know that Judy can read 2 pages in each 1.5-minute interval. So, in 70 intervals, she can read 70 * 2 = 140 pages in the first week.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages she read in the first week to the pages she read in the second week: 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find out how many sandwiches are left, we first need to determine how many sandwiches Cody and Trevor ate. 

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which is 1/3 * 12 = 4 sandwiches. 

Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which is 1/4 * 12 = 3 sandwiches.

In total, they ate 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

To find out how many sandwiches are left, we subtract the total eaten from the initial amount: 12 - 7 = 5 sandwiches.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's denote Shiloh's nephew's age today as 'x'. 

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be 44 + 7 = 51 years. 
In 7 years, his nephew's age will be x + 7.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, we can set up the equation: 51 = 3(x + 7).

Now, let's solve for x. 
51 = 3x + 21
51 - 21 = 3x
30 = 3x
x = 30 / 3
x = 10

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to calculate the amount for each set of teeth and add them together.

For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left $5.00.

For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy left half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. So, for the last two teeth, the tooth fairy left 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the amounts: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Richie scored 80 goals. We also know that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark and 45 more goals than Anna.

Let's denote Mark's goals as M and Anna's goals as A. We can set up two equations based on the given information:

1. Richie's goals = Mark's goals + 20
   80 = M + 20
   M = 60

2. Richie's goals = Anna's goals + 45
   80 = A + 45
   A = 35

Now that we know Mark scored 60 goals and Anna scored 35 goals, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers.

Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how much more money Mitchell made than Liam, we first need to calculate the total amount of money each of them made. 

Liam made $63 in total. 

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece, so we multiply the number of lemonades by the price per lemonade: 21 * 4 = 84. 

Now, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings to find the difference: 84 - 63 = 21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To find out how many action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we first need to determine how much money he has left after buying the wooden action figures and then calculate how many plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining money.

Peter spent $5 each day for 4 days (Sunday through Wednesday) on wooden action figures. So, the total amount spent on wooden action figures is 4 * $5 = $20.

He started with $70, so after buying the wooden action figures, he has $70 - $20 = $50 left.

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures for $2 each. Since there are 3 days left, he can buy 3 * $2 = $6 worth of plastic action figures.

However, Peter only has $50 left, and he can only spend $6 on plastic action figures. This means he will not be able to buy any plastic action figures, as he doesn't have enough money.

So, Peter will have 4 wooden action figures by the end of the week.

The final answer is: 4"
"To calculate the total cost of the kitten, we need to add up the cost of spaying, vaccines, and the broken vases.

The cost of spaying is $200.
The cost of 3 vaccines is 3 x $20 = $60.
The cost of 4 broken vases is 4 x $12 = $48.

Now, let's add up the costs: $200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccines) + $48 (broken vases) = $308.

The final answer is: $308"
"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The total number of roses ordered per week is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is 65 * 4 = 260 roses.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is 40 * 4 = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month: 260 - 160 = 100 roses.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how much money will be remaining in Katina's account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she will withdraw over that period and subtract it from her initial savings.

There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are 2 x 12 = 24 months.

Katina removes $100 from her account every month, so the total amount she will withdraw in 24 months is 24 x $100 = $2400.

Now, let's subtract the total amount withdrawn from her initial savings: $3000 - $2400 = $600.

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her account.

The final answer is: $600"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 per loaf, and since each loaf makes 10 sandwiches, the cost per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30 per sandwich. 

The cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00. So, the cost per sandwich is $30.00 / 10 = $3.00 per sandwich.

The total cost per sandwich is the sum of the cost of bread and cheese/condiments, which is $0.30 + $3.00 = $3.30 per sandwich.

The total revenue from selling 10 sandwiches at $7.00 each is 10 * $7.00 = $70.00.

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. Since they sell 10 sandwiches, the total cost is 10 * $3.30 = $33.00. 

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

The final answer is: $37.00"
"To find out how much money Kate can make, we first need to determine how many muffin crayons she can make. Since she melts 8 small pieces of crayons together in each muffin tin, and there are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we need to find the total number of small pieces of crayons.

First, we find the total number of small pieces of crayons: 3 boxes * 64 crayons per box = 192 crayons.

Since each muffin tin contains 8 small pieces of crayons, we divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find the number of muffin crayons: 192 crayons / 8 crayons per muffin = 24 muffin crayons.

Now, we can find the total amount of money Kate can make by multiplying the number of muffin crayons by the price per muffin crayon: 24 muffin crayons * $1.50 per muffin = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the area of the bedroom and then calculate the cost of the new carpet, padding, and installation.

The area of the bedroom is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the new carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 * $12 = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 * $2 = $432.

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removing the old carpet is 216 * $4 = $864.

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installing the new carpet is 216 * $34 = $7344.

The total cost of replacing the carpet is the sum of the cost of the new carpet, padding, removing the old carpet, and installing the new carpet: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11332.

The total cost of replacing the carpet is $11332.

The final answer is: $11332"
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide by the number of days.

First, let's add up the total number of birds Mack saw:

Day 1 and 2: 50 birds
Day 3: 0 birds
Day 4 and 5: 120 birds
Day 6: 20 birds
Day 7: 90 birds

Total number of birds = 50 + 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 230

There are 7 days in a week. To find the average, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days:

Average number of birds per day = Total number of birds / Number of days
= 230 / 7
= 32.86

So, Mack saw an average of 32.86 birds per day over the week."
"To find the final value of the number train, we need to follow the given operations step by step.

1. The starting value of the number train is 20.
2. Half of the starting value is 20 / 2 = 10.
3. The starting value plus half the number is 20 + 10 = 30.
4. The resulting value is divided by 5, so 30 / 5 = 6.
5. The resulting value is multiplied by the starting value minus 12, so 6 * (20 - 12) = 6 * 8 = 48.

The final value of the number train is 48."
"To find the total number of cards they have together, we first need to determine the number of cards each of them has. 

The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards than he has, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

"To find the percentage by which the oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, and then divide it by the set temperature.

The difference between the actual and set temperature is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees.

The percentage by which the oven is off is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Since the oven is off by 4% for any recipe, we need to find the temperature that is 4% less than 520 degrees.

To do this, we'll calculate 4% of 520 and subtract it from 520.

4% of 520 is (4/100) * 520 = 20.8.

Now, subtract 20.8 from 520 to get the temperature Maggie should set her oven to: 520 - 20.8 = 499.2.

The final answer is: 499.2"
"To find the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time as follows:
1 hour = 60 minutes
Adding the 30 minutes, we get:
60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting the time to minutes:
2 hours = 2 x 60 minutes = 120 minutes
Adding the 5 minutes, we get:
120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Now, we add the time of both movies together:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

The final answer is: 215"
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's house price. 

30% of $76,000 is 0.3 x $76,000 = $22,800.

Now, subtract $22,800 from $76,000 to find the value of Juan's house: $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.

The value of Juan's house is $53,200.

To find the combined value of the two houses, add the value of Juan's house to Herb's house price: $53,200 + $76,000 = $129,200.

The final answer is: $129,200."
"Let's break down the information given. Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 + 20 = 60 dishes.

To find the total number of utensils brought by the two, we need to add the number of cups and dishes each brought. Judy brought 12 + 24 = 36 utensils, and her friend brought 40 + 60 = 100 utensils.

The total number of utensils brought by the two is 36 + 100 = 136."
"To find out how many pairs of contacts Pete will need for 90 days, we need to divide the total number of days by the number of days a single box lasts. 

90 days / 45 days per box = 2 boxes

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, he will have enough contacts for 2 * 45 days = 90 days.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the 2 boxes with the 10% discount. 

Original price of 2 boxes = 2 * $100 = $200
Discount = 10% of $200 = 0.1 * $200 = $20
Price after discount = $200 - $20 = $180

Since Pete will need 2 boxes, and each box contains 90 contacts, he will have a total of 90 * 2 = 180 contacts. 

To find the cost per pair of contacts, we need to divide the total cost by the total number of pairs. 

Number of pairs = 180 contacts / 2 contacts per pair = 90 pairs
Cost per pair = $180 / 90 pairs = $2

The final answer is: $2"
"To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate their individual earnings first.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, for a total of 3 hours. Her hourly wage is $10, so her total earnings are 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours. His total earnings are 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how much water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories she burns during her activities. 

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from aerobics is 2 * 500 = 1000 calories.

She also spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from running is 1 * 600 = 600 calories.

The total calories burned is the sum of calories burned from aerobics and running, which is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units she burned. 

Total calories burned / 200 = 1600 / 200 = 8

Since she needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we multiply the number of 200-calorie units by 100 ml. 

8 * 100 = 800 ml

The final answer is: 800"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Let's assume the number of blue jelly beans is B. 
Since there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of red jelly beans is B - 0.01B = 0.99B. 
Since there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of green jelly beans is B + 0.01B = 1.01B.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500. So, the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans is 4500. 
Therefore, 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500. 
Combine like terms: 2.99B = 4500. 
Divide both sides by 2.99: B = 1500.

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans. 
Number of red jelly beans = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485. 
Number of green jelly beans = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515.

To find the difference between the number of green and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans: 1515 - 1485 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"

"To find the total number of people attending, we need to calculate the number of people invited via email, the number of friends Alex's friends will bring, and the number of Alex's friends and their spouses.

First, let's calculate the number of people invited via email. Each of the 100 people invited will bring 2 friends, so the total number of people invited via email is 100 + (100 * 2) = 300.

Next, Alex calls 10 friends and 8 of them will bring their spouses, so the total number of Alex's friends and their spouses is 10 + 8 = 18.

Now, we add the number of people invited via email and the number of Alex's friends and their spouses to get the total number of people attending. 

Total number of people = 300 + 18 = 318

However, we also need to include Alex herself, so the total number of people attending is 318 + 1 = 319.

Therefore, Alex will need 319 seats.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we first need to calculate how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein percentage in a cup of mushrooms by dividing the protein by the weight: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 or 3%.

Now, we know John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we multiply the weight of mushrooms he eats by the protein percentage: 200 grams * 0.03 = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to find the weekly protein intake: 6 grams/day * 7 days = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's break down the information given. If Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can represent his current age as 'x'. 

Five years ago, Jerry's age would be 'x - 5'. According to the problem, Jerry's current age is twice his age 5 years ago, so we can write the equation as:

x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting '2x' from both sides of the equation gives us:

-x = -10

Dividing both sides by '-1', we get:

x = 10

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years. 

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, it will be 2x. 

And since one angle is three times the smallest angle, it will be 3x.

We know that the sum of all three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180.

Combine like terms: 6x = 180.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 30.

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. One angle is 2x, which is 2 * 30 = 60 degrees. The other angle is 3x, which is 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

First, let's convert the quarters to cents: 8 quarters * 25 cents = 200 cents
Next, let's convert the dimes to cents: 6 dimes * 10 cents = 60 cents
Then, we already have the number of nickels in cents: 14 nickels * 5 cents = 70 cents
Lastly, let's convert the pennies to cents: 15 pennies * 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has: 200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs a nickel (5 cents), we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball: 345 cents / 5 cents = 69

Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and then add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the weight Jamaal uses after increasing the 8-pound weight by 50%, we first need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds. 

50% of 8 pounds is 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds. 

Now, we add this to the original weight: 8 pounds + 4 pounds = 12 pounds. 

However, Jamaal finds this weight too heavy, so he uses a weight two pounds lighter than this. 

The weight he now uses is 12 pounds - 2 pounds = 10 pounds.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down Steve's game collection over the three years.

In the first year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift and 5 games as Christmas gifts, totaling 10 games. He also buys 1 game per month for 12 months, which is 12 games. So, in total, he has 10 + 12 = 22 games at the end of the first year.

In the second year, Steve gets 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, totaling 10 games. He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, which is 24 games. So, in total, he has 10 (gifts) + 24 (bought) = 34 games at the end of the second year.

In the third year, Steve gets 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, totaling 10 games. He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, which is 48 games. So, in total, he has 10 (gifts) + 48 (bought) = 58 games at the end of the third year.

To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we add the games from each year: 22 (first year) + 34 (second year) + 58 (third year) = 114 games.

The final answer is: 114"
"To find the rate at which the plane is traveling, we need to divide the distance it traveled by the time it took. 

Distance = 1200 miles
Time = 3 hours

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we need to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this rate.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Since the question asks for the additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles, we need to subtract the initial 3 hours from the total time.

Additional Time = Total Time - Initial Time
Additional Time = 5 hours - 3 hours
Additional Time = 2 hours

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much Marissa makes in an hour, we need to first find out how much Ruiz makes in an hour. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, we divide 120 by 2 to get the amount he makes in an hour.

Ruiz's hourly production = 120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours. Since Ruiz makes 60 pounds in an hour, we multiply 60 by 2 to find out how much he makes in 2 hours, then multiply that by 3/4 to find Marissa's hourly production.

Ruiz's 2-hour production = 60 * 2 = 120 pounds
Marissa's hourly production = (3/4) * 120 = 90 pounds per hour.

Now, we know that Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour and Marissa makes 90 pounds per hour. To find the total amount of chocolate they make together in 12 hours, we add their hourly production and multiply by 12.

Total production per hour = 60 + 90 = 150 pounds per hour
Total production in 12 hours = 150 * 12 = 1800 pounds

The final answer is: 1800"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

On Monday, Howard spends $8 at the arcade. 

On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as Monday, so he spends 2 * $8 = $16.

On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as Tuesday, so he spends 4 * $16 = $64.

To find out how much he spent in total, we add the amounts spent on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

Since Howard originally had $100, we subtract the total amount spent from the original amount to find out how much he has left: $100 - $88 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find the total amount of money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the total number of cups sold and the total revenue from each time period, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of cups sold in the first four hours:
15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups

The total revenue from the first four hours is:
60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30

Next, let's calculate the total number of cups sold in the next two hours:
10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups

The total revenue from the next two hours is:
20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12

Now, let's add the revenue from both time periods:
$30 + $12 = $42

Patrick earned a total of $42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

"To find out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to calculate the total number of rotations the tire can handle and divide it by the number of rotations per 2 miles, then divide that by the number of miles Jeremy drives per month.

First, let's find out how many rotations the tire can handle per mile: 
725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile

Now, let's find out how many rotations the tire can handle per month:
362.5 rotations per mile * 400 miles per month = 145,000 rotations per month

Now, let's find out how many months the tire can last:
10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations per month = 72 months

Now, let's convert months to years:
72 months / 12 months per year = 6 years

"To find the cost per pump, we need to first find the total number of pumps in the bottle. Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, and Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, we can multiply the number of washings by the number of pumps used per wash to get the total number of pumps in the bottle.

Total number of pumps = 120 washings * 2 pumps/washing = 240 pumps

Now, we can find the cost per pump by dividing the total cost of the bottle by the total number of pumps.

Cost per pump = Total cost / Total number of pumps
= $24.00 / 240 pumps
= 0.10 dollars per pump

To convert dollars to cents, we multiply by 100.

Cost per pump in cents = 0.10 * 100
= 10 cents

"To find out how much money Joe will have left after the purchase, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. 

The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is $25 + $35 = $60.

Since there's a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount. To do this, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage (30% or 0.3).

Discount = $60 * 0.3 = $18

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final price.

Final price = $60 - $18 = $42

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to add any additional tax to the final price.

Joe started with $50, so to find out how much money he'll have left, we subtract the final price from the initial amount.

Money left = $50 - $42 = $8

The final answer is: $8"
"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants he wants to make in a week. Since he wants to make 4 dozen a day for 7 days, we multiply 4 dozen by 7.

4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can convert 28 dozen to the total number of croissants:

28 dozen * 12 croissants/dozen = 336 croissants

Now, we know it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find out how much butter is needed for 336 croissants, we first need to convert the number of croissants to dozens:

336 croissants / 12 croissants/dozen = 28 dozen

Now, we can multiply the number of dozens by the amount of butter needed per dozen:

28 dozen * (1/4 pound/dozen) = 28 * 0.25 = 7 pounds

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 336 croissants.

"To find the cost of repaving Lewis' street, we need to multiply the cost per meter by the length of his street. 

Cost per meter: $194
Length of Lewis' street: 490 meters

Cost to repave Lewis' street = Cost per meter * Length of Lewis' street
Cost to repave Lewis' street = $194 * 490
Cost to repave Lewis' street = $95,060

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's, we need to calculate the cost of repaving Monica's street and then subtract it from the cost of repaving Lewis' street.

Cost to repave Monica's street = Cost per meter * Length of Monica's street
Cost to repave Monica's street = $194 * 150
Cost to repave Monica's street = $29,100

Now, let's find the difference in cost:
Difference in cost = Cost to repave Lewis' street - Cost to repave Monica's street

"To find the total cost of John's research, we first need to determine the total number of months his research took. Since it took 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, it took 5 * 10 = 50 months.

The initial 5 months cost $100,000. After that, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the funding for the remaining 45 months (50 - 5 = 45) will be 1.5 times the initial amount.

The cost for the first 5 months is $100,000. The cost for the remaining 45 months is 1.5 * $100,000 = $150,000 per month. 

To find the total cost for the remaining 45 months, we multiply the monthly cost by the number of months: $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.

Now, we add the cost of the initial 5 months to the cost of the remaining 45 months: $100,000 + $6,750,000 = $6,850,000.

The total cost of John's research is $6,850,000.

"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim chews during school, we need to calculate how many 2-hour intervals are in an 8-hour school day. 

8 hours / 2 hours per interval = 4 intervals

Since Jim chews 1 piece of gum per 2-hour interval, he chews 4 pieces of gum during school.

He also chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.

In total, Jim chews 4 (during school) + 2 (on the way home and after dinner) = 6 pieces of gum.

Jim started with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

First, let's find the total cost of the cars: 10 cars * $25,000 = $250,000.

The company paid 30% of the cost to acquire the cars, so the amount they paid is 0.3 * $250,000 = $75,000.

The profit from selling the cars is the selling price minus the cost to acquire them: $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

James gets a 10% commission on the profit, so his commission is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made $17,500."
"To find the number of men who can stay upright, we first need to find the total number of riders who can stay upright. 

Given that 25% of the riders can stay upright, and there are 100 riders, we can calculate the number of riders who can stay upright as follows:

25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25

Now, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women. To find the number of women, we can calculate:

60% of 25 = 0.6 * 25 = 15

Since the remaining riders who can stay upright are men, we can find the number of men by subtracting the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

25 - 15 = 10

So, 10 men can stay upright on the wave.

"To find the total price for all three jewels, we first need to find the prices of the gold and silver jewels.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we know that the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel. 

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * $2000
Price of gold jewel = $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold. 

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels.

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200
Total price = $4800

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps, we add the number of each type of stamp together: 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the relative speed between Bob and Tom. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed to get the relative speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph
Relative speed = -15 mph

However, since we are dealing with a time problem, we need to consider the absolute value of the relative speed, which is the distance between them divided by the time it takes to close the gap.

Relative speed = 15 mph (absolute value)

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

The final answer is: 5"

Darren's catch = Naomi's catch - 6
Darren's catch = 17 - 6
Darren's catch = 11

We also know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. To find Tommy's catch, we add 3 to Darren's total:

Tommy's catch = Darren's catch + 3
Tommy's catch = 11 + 3
Tommy's catch = 14

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to determine the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's assume the cost per class is $10. If Manny attends all 10 classes, the total cost would be 10 classes * $10 per class = $100. However, he signed up for classes for $60, so he has a remaining balance of $40.

Since he has a remaining balance of $40, he can miss classes without exceeding the $10 per class limit. To find out how many classes he can miss, we need to divide the remaining balance by the cost per class.

$40 (remaining balance) / $10 (cost per class) = 4 classes

So, Manny can miss 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

"To find the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to determine their individual daily production and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, Julie's daily production is 2 * 50 = 100 customers.

Now, let's calculate their combined daily production: 50 (Jewel's production) + 100 (Julie's production) = 150 customers per day.

To find their total weekly production, we multiply their combined daily production by 7: 150 * 7 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to first determine how many miles Reggie ran. We know that Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, and Paisley ran 4 miles. So, Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

We also know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. This means that Reggie's distance minus 3 miles is equal to Lynn's distance. So, Lynn's distance = Reggie's distance - 3 miles = 20 - 3 = 17 miles.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to find the cost of one apple and one orange. 

The cost of 4 apples is $5.20, so the cost of one apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30. 

The cost of 3 oranges is $3.30, so the cost of one orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Now, we can find the cost of 5 apples: 5 apples * $1.30/apple = $6.50.

Next, we can find the cost of 5 oranges: 5 oranges * $1.10/orange = $5.50.

Finally, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges: $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we can multiply the volume by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot.

Time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the features and the base price:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To find out how much Tim will make in a year, we need to calculate his new monthly salary and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise on his $20,000 monthly salary. 
5% of $20,000 is 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000. 
So, his new monthly salary will be $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000.

Next, let's calculate the bonus, which is half a month's salary. 
Half of $20,000 is $10,000. 

Now, let's add the bonus to his new monthly salary. 
$21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000.

Finally, let's multiply his new monthly salary by 12 to find out how much he will make in a year. 
$31,000 * 12 = $372,000.

"To find the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add them together.

Alisa biked at 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. To find the distance she biked, we multiply her speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 12 miles/hour x 4.5 hours
Distance = 54 miles

Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. To find the distance he biked, we multiply his speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 2.5 hours
Distance = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances biked by Alisa and Stanley to find the total distance:

Total Distance = Distance biked by Alisa + Distance biked by Stanley
Total Distance = 54 miles + 25 miles
Total Distance = 79 miles

"To find the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, then add those times together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil. Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil, and he needs to dig 24 feet of soil. 

Time to dig through soil = Total soil depth / Rate of digging through soil
Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour
Time to dig through soil = 6 hours

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay. Bill can dig half as fast through clay as he can through soil, so his rate of digging through clay is 4 / 2 = 2 feet/hour. He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

Time to dig through clay = Total clay depth / Rate of digging through clay
Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour
Time to dig through clay = 4 hours

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay to find the total time.

Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours
Total time = 10 hours

"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost for each day and then subtract the two amounts.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got a $2 discount. So, the total cost for the first day is:
20 pomegranates * $20 = $400
Discount: $2
Total cost for the first day: $400 - $2 = $398

On the second day, the price per pomegranate is $30, and there's a 10% discount on the total cost. So, the total cost for the second day is:
20 pomegranates * $30 = $600
Discount: 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Total cost for the second day: $600 - $60 = $540

Now, let's find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days:
Difference = Total cost for the second day - Total cost for the first day
Difference = $540 - $398
Difference = $142

The final answer is: $142"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

In the first month, Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. This means her sales from green hats in the first month were 2 * $400 = $800.

The total sales in the first month were $400 (red) + $800 (green) = $1200.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month were (3/4) * $1200 = $900.

The total sales in two months are $1200 (first month) + $900 (second month) = $2100.

"Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, we can set up the following equation based on the total number of legs:

4S + 2G = 70

We are also given that the total number of animal heads is 20. Since each sheep and goose has one head, we can set up another equation:

S + G = 20

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of G in both equations the same:

2S + 2G = 40

Now we can subtract this equation from the first equation to eliminate G:

(4S + 2G) - (2S + 2G) = 70 - 40
2S = 30

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

S = 15

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

Now, we need to solve for 'x'. To do this, we'll subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

21 - 3 = 2x + 3 - 3
18 = 2x

Next, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate 'x':

18 / 2 = 2x / 2
9 = x

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we need to first convert the initial height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we multiply 20 feet by 12 inches per foot.

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we know the bamboo grows 30 inches a day and it's currently 240 inches tall. To find out how many days it will take to reach 600 inches, we subtract the current height from the target height and divide by the daily growth rate.

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Now, we divide the remaining inches by the daily growth rate.

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

So, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.

Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, which is 2/3 * $720 = $480.

The remaining amount after Frances' investment is $720 - $480 = $240.

So, Skyler's investment is $240.

The final answer is: $240"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many signatures the sisters have in total and then subtract that from their goal of 100 signatures.

Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. 

Total signatures collected so far = 20 + 44 = 64

The sisters have three more weeks of summer vacation. Since they want to reach 100 signatures by the end of the summer, we need to find out how many signatures they need to collect in the remaining three weeks.

Signatures needed to reach the goal = 100 - 64 = 36

So, the sisters need to collect 36 signatures in the remaining three weeks to reach their goal."
"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we first need to determine her hourly wage. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen's hourly wage is 2 * $10 = $20.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Karen works in two days. Since she works 3 hours per day, in two days she works 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we can calculate Karen's total earnings by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours she works: $20 * 6 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we need to determine the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. 

Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can calculate the ratio as follows: 

36 hash browns / 6 potatoes = 6 hash browns per potato

Now, we can multiply this ratio by the total number of potatoes to find the total number of hash browns that can be made:

6 hash browns per potato * 96 potatoes = 576 hash browns

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

"To find out how much the group will exceed the maximum load, we first need to calculate the total weight of the 9 adults. 

The weight of one adult is 80 kg. 
The weight of 9 adults is 9 * 80 kg = 720 kg.

Since the elevator can support a maximum load of 700 kg, we need to find out how much more weight the group will add to the maximum load.

The excess weight is 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of cookies, we need to determine the number of cookies each person has. 

We know Katarina has 68 cookies. 

Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, we can find the total number of cookies by adding the number of cookies each person has: 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298.

The final answer is: 298"
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to consider the two changes made to the dress. 

First, the dress was extended by 50% of its original length. If we let the original length be 'x', then the extended length would be x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

Next, 20cm was added to the bottom of the dress. So, the final length is 1.5x + 20 = 140cm.

Now, we can solve for 'x'. 

1.5x + 20 = 140

Subtract 20 from both sides:
1.5x = 120

Divide both sides by 1.5:
x = 80

The original length of the dress was 80cm.

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode and then add them together.

First, let's find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in turtle mode. Since it takes 1 hour to mow the entire lawn in turtle mode, it will take 1/2 hour or 30 minutes to mow half the lawn in turtle mode.

Next, let's find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode. Since it takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn in rabbit mode, it will take 40/2 = 20 minutes to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode.

Now, we add the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode: 30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break down the time it takes for John and Jack to get to the library and the fire station. 

They spend 6 minutes to get to the library and another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. So, the total time spent so far is 6 + 13 = 19 minutes.

They have 30 minutes in total to get to school. Since they have already spent 19 minutes, they have 30 - 19 = 11 minutes left to get to school without being late."
"To find the total amount Catherine paid, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

The cost of 1 kilo of apples is $4.
The cost of 2 kilos of bananas is 2 * $2 = $4.

"To find out how many cookies are in the box, we first need to determine the total number of cookies baked by both Greta and Celinda. 

Greta bakes 30 cookies. 
Celinda bakes twice as many as Greta, so she bakes 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

The total number of cookies baked is 30 (Greta's cookies) + 60 (Celinda's cookies) = 90 cookies.

After eating 10 cookies, the number of cookies left is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

So, there are 80 cookies in the box.

"Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t. 

Since there are two twins and one triplet, the total age is 2T + t = 44. 

We also know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so T = t + 7.

Substituting T = t + 7 into the first equation, we get 2(t + 7) + t = 44.

Expanding the equation, we get 2t + 14 + t = 44.

Combining like terms, we get 3t + 14 = 44.

Subtracting 14 from both sides, we get 3t = 30.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get t = 10.

Now that we know the age of the triplet, we can find the age of the older twin. Since T = t + 7, T = 10 + 7 = 17.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we first need to calculate the total time he spends on his homework. 

Math homework: 20 minutes
Reading homework: 40 minutes
History homework: 20 minutes
Total homework time: 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

Since John has 3 hours before dinner, we need to convert the hours to minutes. 
3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total available time to find out how many minutes John has to nap.
Time available for nap: 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

So, John has 100 minutes to nap. 

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to find the cost of one candy. We know that Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for $3.20. 

First, let's find the total cost of the lollipops: 5 lollipops * $0.40 = $2. 

Now, we subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of the candies: $3.20 - $2 = $1.20. 

Since there are 4 candies, we divide the total cost of the candies by 4 to find the cost of one candy: $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, we know the cost of one lollipop ($0.40) and one candy ($0.30). We can multiply the cost of one lollipop by 10 to find the cost of 10 lollipops: 10 * $0.40 = $4.

We can multiply the cost of one candy by 10 to find the cost of 10 candies: 10 * $0.30 = $3.

Finally, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to find the total cost: $4 + $3 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To find out how many coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we first need to calculate how many coins each of them saves per year and then multiply it by 10.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. To find out how many coins he saves per year, we multiply 20 by 12 (the number of months in a year).

20 * 12 = 240 coins per year for Rong.

Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. To find out how many coins Neil saves per month, we first need to find 2/5 of 20, which is (2/5) * 20 = 8. Then, we add this to 20 to get the total number of coins Neil saves per month.

20 + 8 = 28 coins per month for Neil.

Now, we multiply 28 by 12 to find out how many coins Neil saves per year.

28 * 12 = 336 coins per year for Neil.

Now that we know how many coins Rong and Neil save per year, we can multiply this by 10 to find out how many coins they save in 10 years.

Rong's total savings in 10 years: 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Neil's total savings in 10 years: 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is the sum of their individual savings.

2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins

"To find the total bill, we first need to calculate the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, which means the total bill is the heartworm check divided by 0.6. Let's call the total bill 'x'. Then, 0.6x = $40 + $20 (vaccines) + heartworm check. However, we don't know the cost of the heartworm check yet, so we'll call it 'h'. 

The total bill is the sum of the vaccines and the heartworm check, so x = $40 + h. 

Now we can substitute this into the equation 0.6x = $40 + h. We get 0.6($40 + h) = $40 + h. 

Expanding the left side of the equation, we get 0.6 * $40 + 0.6h = $40 + h. 

0.6 * $40 is $24, so we have $24 + 0.6h = $40 + h. 

Now, let's subtract 0.6h from both sides of the equation to get $24 = $40 + 0.4h. 

Now, let's subtract $40 from both sides of the equation to get -$16 = 0.4h. 

Now, let's divide both sides of the equation by 0.4 to get h = -$16 / 0.4. 

h = -$16 / 0.4 = -$40.

"To find the price of the crate, we first need to determine the cost of each type of fruit. 

Since one banana costs twice as much as an apple, and one apple costs $0.5, a banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

Oranges cost three times as much as a banana, so the cost of one orange is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each type of fruit in a crate:
- Bananas: 5 bananas * $1 = $5
- Apples: 12 apples * $0.5 = $6
- Oranges: 7 oranges * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is the sum of the costs of all the fruits: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

The final answer is: $32"
"To find the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter, we need to calculate the total number of squares and multiply it by the area of each square, which is 1 square foot.

We know that there are 14 red squares. 
There are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so there are 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.
There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so there are 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.
There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so there are 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, let's add up the total number of squares: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68 squares.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

8 high chairs * 5 = 40 regular chairs

Now, we add the number of high chairs and regular chairs to find the total number of chairs.

8 high chairs + 40 regular chairs = 48 chairs

Since there will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending, we need to find the total number of chairs required. Babies will use high chairs, so we add the number of adults and babies.

42 adults + 15 babies = 57 people

Since each person needs a chair, we need 57 chairs in total. To find out how many more chairs Mia needs, we subtract the number of chairs she has from the total number of chairs required.

57 total chairs - 48 available chairs = 9 more chairs

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the number of 8-point bucks, we first need to find the total number of bucks in the field. Since 50% of the deer are bucks, we can calculate this as follows:

Total deer = 50
Bucks = 50% of 50 = 0.5 * 50 = 25

Next, we need to find the number of 8-point bucks. Since 20% of the bucks are 8-point, we can calculate this as follows:

8-point bucks = 20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5

So, there are 5 8-point bucks in the field.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Adam has 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 
   To find Betty's points, we need to calculate 30% of Adam's points and add it to Adam's points.
   30% of 50 = 0.3 * 50 = 15
   Betty's points = Adam's points + 15 = 50 + 15 = 65
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty. 
   Tom's points = Betty's points - 30 = 65 - 30 = 35
4. Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom.
   Marta's points = 3 * Tom's points = 3 * 35 = 105

Now, let's add up the points of all the students:
Adam's points + Betty's points + Tom's points + Marta's points = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the minimum threshold:
400 - 255 = 145

The class is missing 145 points to go on the trip."
"To find the total number of great-grandbabies, we need to start with the number of great-grandbabies each of Great Grandma Jones' children has, which is 3. Then, we need to multiply this number by the number of children Great Grandma Jones has, which is also 3.

So, the total number of great-grandbabies from the first generation is 3 * 3 = 9.

However, each of these 9 great-grandbabies also has 3 babies of their own, who are the great-great-grandbabies. To find the total number of great-grandbabies, we need to multiply the number of great-grandbabies from the first generation by the number of babies each of them has, which is 3.

So, the total number of great-grandbabies is 9 * 3 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much Greta has left to spend, we need to calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account and her car payment, then subtract those amounts from her total paycheck.

First, let's calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account: 50% of $2400.00 is 0.5 x $2400.00 = $1200.00.

Next, let's calculate the amount she uses for her car payment: 20% of $2400.00 is 0.2 x $2400.00 = $480.00.

Now, let's subtract the amounts from her total paycheck: $2400.00 - $1200.00 - $480.00 = $720.00.

So, Greta has $720.00 left to spend.

"To find the number of pairs of pencils in the box, we first need to determine the total number of pencils in the box. Since there are 4 pencils missing, we subtract 4 from the total capacity of the box, which is 20.

20 (total capacity) - 4 (missing pencils) = 16 pencils

Now, to find the number of pairs of pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by 2.

16 pencils / 2 = 8 pairs

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we first need to find out how many fireworks will be set off in total and then calculate 40% of that number. 

The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks set off by the city is 15 * 20 = 300. 

Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks she will set off is 3 * 5 = 15.

The total number of fireworks set off is 300 (city) + 15 (Hannah) = 315.

Now, we need to find 40% of 315. To do this, we multiply 315 by 0.4. 

0.4 * 315 = 126.

So, Hannah will see 126 fireworks in total. 

The final answer is: 126"
"To find the total amount spent on snacks and drinks, we first need to determine the total number of people, the total number of drinks, and the total number of snacks.

Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people. When they meet up with 7 more friends, the total number of people becomes 13 + 7 = 20.

Since each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks, the total number of drinks and snacks will be the same as the total number of people, which is 20.

The total number of drinks is 20, and each drink costs $2. So, the total cost of drinks is 20 * $2 = $40.

The total number of snacks is also 20, and each snack costs $2. So, the total cost of snacks is 20 * $2 = $40.

The total cost of snacks and drinks is $40 + $40 = $80.

The final answer is: $80"
"Let's break down the information given. Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's, so Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.

We know that when Gary joins Gissela and Gordy, the three trucks combined can haul 11,600 pounds of gravel. To find out how much Gary's truck can haul, we need to subtract the combined capacity of Gissela and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity of all three trucks.

Combined capacity of Gissela and Gordy's trucks = 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds

Now, subtract this from the total capacity of all three trucks: 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds

Gary's truck can haul 2,800 pounds of gravel.

2,800"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many dumplings each male ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males in the group, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

There are 6 females in the group, and each female ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

The total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females is 32 + 18 = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the total number of dumplings eaten by the group, which is 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much money Gerald had initially, we need to determine the total parts in the ratio and Gerald's share. The ratio is 3:2, so the total parts are 3 + 2 = 5.

Gerald's share is 3 out of 5 parts, so we can find his initial amount by multiplying his share by the total amount: (3/5) * 100 = 60.

Now, we know Gerald spent $10 on a book, so we subtract that from his initial amount to find out how much he has left: 60 - 10 = 50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. 

Speed of the cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we can find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

Distance = Speed of the turtle * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how many hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we need to first determine how much they need to raise per hour to reach their goal. 

The total amount they need to raise is $6300, and they have already raised $2100 in 3 hours. 

The amount they need to raise in total is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

Since they need to raise $4200 in total and they have already raised $2100 in 3 hours, we can find the amount they need to raise per hour by dividing the remaining amount by the number of hours they have already worked.

$4200 / 3 hours = $1400 per hour.

Now, we can find the total number of hours they need to fundraise by dividing the total amount they need to raise by the amount they need to raise per hour.

$4200 / $1400 per hour = 3 hours.

However, this is the amount of time they need to raise the remaining $4200. Since they have already worked 3 hours, we need to add this to the time they need to raise the remaining amount.

Total hours = 3 hours (already worked) + 3 hours (to raise the remaining amount) = 6 hours.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes, we first need to find the percentage used for industrial purposes and then subtract it from the total percentage used by the city.

Given that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes, we can calculate the percentage used for industrial purposes as follows:

40% (total used by Colorado City) * 80% (industrial purposes) = 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 or 32%

This means 32% of the river's total water is used by Colorado City for industrial purposes.

To find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the industrial percentage from the total percentage used by the city:

40% (total used by Colorado City) - 32% (industrial purposes) = 8%

Therefore, 8% of the river's total water is used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how much Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we first need to calculate the total number of days in 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks would have 7 * 2 = 14 days.

Now, we know Alex charges $12 per day. To find the total amount she charges for 14 days, we multiply the daily charge by the number of days: 12 * 14 = 168.

So, Alex charges $168 for 2 weeks of tutoring.

"To find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rate of each type of ice cream and then add them together.

The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. To find the production rate, we divide the total quarts by the time:

100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour (chocolate)

The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. To find the production rate, we divide the total quarts by the time:

50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour (vanilla)

Now, we need to find the total production in 48 hours for each type of ice cream:

Chocolate: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Adding the total production of both types of ice cream:

2400 quarts (chocolate) + 600 quarts (vanilla) = 3000 quarts

"To find Marcus' total bill, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items he ordered and then apply the 10% discount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of each type of item:

- 5 croissants at $3.00 apiece: 5 x $3.00 = $15.00
- 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each: 4 x $2.50 = $10.00
- 3 mini quiches at $4.00 apiece: 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
- 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 apiece: 13 x $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
$15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Since Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off his purchase, we need to calculate the discount amount:
10% of $50.00 = 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost:
$50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many scoops Erin can buy with her $6.00. Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide the total amount of money Erin has by the cost of each scoop.

$6.00 Ã· $1.50 = 4

This means Erin can buy 4 scoops of ice cream. However, the deal is buy 2 scoops get 1 free, so we need to consider the free scoop as well. 

Since Erin can buy 4 scoops, and the deal is buy 2 get 1 free, she can buy 2 sets of 3 scoops (2 paid scoops + 1 free scoop). 

2 sets of 3 scoops = 6 scoops

So, Erin should buy 6 scoops of ice cream.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total amount of candy each girl eats in two weeks and subtract that from their initial amount.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56, so she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.

Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42, so she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

"To find the total number of tiles needed, we first need to calculate the area of two-thirds of the bathroom. 

The area of the entire bathroom is 36 sq ft. To find two-thirds of this area, we multiply 36 by 2/3.

36 * (2/3) = 36 * 2 / 3 = 72 / 3 = 24

So, two-thirds of the bathroom is 24 sq ft. 

Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 tiles per square foot, we multiply the area of two-thirds of the bathroom by 24.

24 * 24 = 576

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.

576"
"To find out how much James saved, we first need to calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries and then compare it to the cost of buying them at the store.

The cost of picking blueberries is $20 (initial cost) + $1.5 per pound * 30 pounds (total weight picked). 

First, let's calculate the cost of picking the blueberries: 
$20 (initial cost) + $1.5 * 30 = $20 + $45 = $65

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the blueberries at the store: 
$2.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $2.5 * 30 = $75

The difference between the cost of buying at the store and the cost of picking is $75 - $65 = $10.

James saved $10 by picking the blueberries instead of buying them at the store.

The final answer is: $10"
"To find the new price of each computer, we need to calculate 10% of the original price and add it to the original price. 

Original price per computer = $700
Increase in price = 10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70
New price per computer = Original price + Increase in price = $700 + $70 = $770

Now, we can find the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices.

Total number of computers = 500
Total amount paid = New price per computer * Total number of computers = $770 * 500 = $385,000

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that there are 6 people in total (Bryce and his 5 friends). Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices is 6 * 12 = 72.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 3 people eating 2/3 of their pizzas, we can calculate the total number of slices they ate as follows:

(2/3) * (3 * 12) = (2/3) * 36 = 24

The two remaining friends ate Â¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 people eating Â¾ of their pizzas, we can calculate the total number of slices they ate as follows:

(3/4) * (2 * 12) = (3/4) * 24 = 18

Now, let's add the slices eaten by both groups:

24 + 18 = 42

To find the number of slices left, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:

72 - 42 = 30

So, there are 30 slices of pizza left.

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe into inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 8 feet into inches by multiplying 8 by 12, which equals 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, we get a total of 100 inches for the length of one of Topher's shoes.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. We can write the equation as:

100 = 9x + 10

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

90 = 9x

Now, we divide both sides by 9 to find the value of 'x':

x = 90 / 9
x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

"To determine the total number of s'mores needed, we first need to calculate the total number of s'mores required for the kids and the adults separately.

For the kids, each kid wants 2 s'mores, and there are 9 kids. So, the total number of s'mores needed for the kids is 9 * 2 = 18.

For the adults, each adult wants 1 s'more, and there are 6 adults. So, the total number of s'mores needed for the adults is 6 * 1 = 6.

Now, we add the total number of s'mores needed for the kids and the adults to get the overall total. 18 (for kids) + 6 (for adults) = 24 s'mores.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 s'mores, we need to divide the total number of s'mores needed by 8 to find out how many sleeves are required. 24 / 8 = 3.

However, we also need to consider that there are 3 sleeves in a box. Since we need 3 sleeves, we need at least 1 box of graham crackers.

The final answer is: 1"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

1. Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 
   Let's denote Dora's age as D. Then, Dora's father's age is 2D + 8.

2. Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. 
   So, Dora's mother's age is (2D + 8) - 4.

3. Dora is 15 years old. 
   We can substitute D = 15 into the expressions for Dora's father's and mother's ages.

Dora's father's age = 2(15) + 8 = 38
Dora's mother's age = (2(15) + 8) - 4 = 30

Now, let's calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.
Total combined age = Dora's age + Dora's father's age + Dora's mother's age
Total combined age = 15 + 38 + 30
Total combined age = 83

The final answer is: 83"
"To find out how much money each of Greg's siblings got, we need to divide the total amount of money ($20) by the number of siblings (3).

"To find the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying, we need to calculate the weight of each book and then add them together.

Cindy has 3 math and science books, so the total weight of these books is 3 x 2 = 6 pounds.

Her French book weighs 4 pounds and her English book weighs 3 pounds.

Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book, so it weighs 2 x 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all the books: 6 (math and science) + 4 (French) + 3 (English) + 6 (history) = 19 pounds.

The total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 19 pounds.

"To find out how many votes candidate C got, we first need to determine the number of votes candidate B received. 

Candidate A got 20% of the votes, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes. 

Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes, so we need to calculate 50% of 20 and add it to 20. 
50% of 20 is 0.5 * 20 = 10. 
So, candidate B got 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

Since there are 100 voters in total, and candidate A and B together got 20 + 30 = 50 votes, candidate C must have received the remaining votes. 
The remaining votes are 100 - 50 = 50.

The final answer is: 50"

Boris has 100 apples. 
Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. 
Boris has 100 - 10 = 90 apples.
Beck has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract Beck's amount from Boris's amount. 
90 - 87 = 3

For giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces per cube = 12 ounces
For medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces per cube = 14 ounces
For small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces per cube = 4 ounces

Now, let's add up the total amount of water used: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces

Since Peter started with 32 ounces of water, we subtract the total amount used from the initial amount: 32 - 30 = 2 ounces

"Let's break down the information given. We know that 10 students like to bake and 5 like to play basketball. The total number of students is 50. 

Since the rest of the students like to either play video games or play music, we can find the number of students who like to play video games or music by subtracting the number of students who like to bake and basketball from the total number of students.

Number of students who like to bake or basketball = 10 + 5 = 15

Number of students who like to play video games or music = 50 - 15 = 35

We are also given that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball. 

Number of students who like to play music = 2 * 5 = 10

Now, we can find the number of students who like to play video games by subtracting the number of students who like to play music from the number of students who like to play video games or music.

Number of students who like to play video games = 35 - 10 = 25

Now, we add 20 to the number of fearless birds: 8 + 20 = 28.

The final answer is: 28"
"To find the number of boys in each class, we first need to find the total number of girls in both classes. Since 40% of the students in each class are girls, and there are 80 students in total, we can set up an equation to find the number of students in each class.

Let x be the number of students in each class. Since there are two classes, the total number of students is 2x. We know that 40% of the students in each class are girls, so the number of girls in each class is 0.4x. Since there are two classes, the total number of girls is 2(0.4x) = 0.8x.

We know that the total number of students is 80, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 80

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 80 / 2
x = 40

So, there are 40 students in each class. Now, we can find the number of boys in each class. Since 40% of the students are girls, 60% are boys. The number of boys in each class is 0.6x = 0.6(40) = 24.

The number of boys in each class is 24.

"To find out how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we need to calculate the total number of animals and then divide that by the number of days in a week, which is 7.

First, let's add up the number of animals that need grooming:

- Dogs: 8
- Cats: 5
- Birds: 3
- Horses: 12

Total animals = 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28

Now, let's divide the total number of animals by the number of days in a week:

28 animals / 7 days = 4 animals per day

So, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week.

"To find the total profit, we first need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The total cost is the cost of the packs, which is 3 packs * $1800 each = $5400.

The total revenue is the sum of the values of the cards. 
- The card worth $4000 contributes $4000 to the revenue.
- The card worth $1000 contributes $1000 to the revenue.
- The 30 cards worth an average of $50 each contribute 30 * $50 = $1500 to the revenue.
So, the total revenue is $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

The final answer is: $1100"
"To find the total cost for each amusement park, we need to calculate the cost for the adults and the children separately and then add them together.

For the first amusement park:
- Cost for adults: 2 adults * $26 = $52
- Cost for children: 2 children * $12 = $24
- Total cost for the first amusement park: $52 + $24 = $76

For the second amusement park:
- Cost for adults: 2 adults * $14 = $28
- Cost for children: 2 children * $10 = $20
- Total cost for the second amusement park: $28 + $20 = $48

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two amusement parks to determine how much they will save by choosing the second amusement park:
- Savings = Total cost of the first amusement park - Total cost of the second amusement park
- Savings = $76 - $48
- Savings = $28

"To find out how much money the tomato vendor saves a week, we first need to calculate the daily savings. 

The vendor used to buy 500 tomatoes at $.5 each, so his daily cost was 500 * $.5 = $250.

With the new vendor, he buys the same 500 tomatoes at $.4 each, so his new daily cost is 500 * $.4 = $200.

The daily savings is the difference between the old cost and the new cost, which is $250 - $200 = $50.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the weekly savings is the daily savings multiplied by 7, which is $50 * 7 = $350.

The final answer is: $350"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Sean has 56 marbles. Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, we can find the number of marbles Cal has by multiplying Sean's marbles by 2.

Cal's marbles = 2 * Sean's marbles
Cal's marbles = 2 * 56
Cal's marbles = 112

We also know that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. So, we can find the number of marbles Carl has by multiplying Sean's marbles by 4.

Carl's marbles = 4 * Sean's marbles
Carl's marbles = 4 * 56
Carl's marbles = 224

Now, we need to find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined. We can do this by adding the number of marbles Carl and Cal have.

Total marbles = Carl's marbles + Cal's marbles
Total marbles = 224 + 112
Total marbles = 336

"To find out how many groups are needed, we first need to determine the number of students per group. Since there are 54 students and they are to be separated into 6 groups of equal size, we divide the total number of students by the number of groups.

54 students / 6 groups = 9 students per group

However, the activity now requires 12 groups. To find out how many students are needed for 12 groups, we multiply the number of students per group by the new number of groups.

9 students per group * 12 groups = 108 students

Since there are 54 students, we need to find out how many more students are needed to reach 108 students. 

108 students - 54 students = 54 students

However, the question asks for the number of groups needed, not the number of students. Since we already know that 54 students are needed for 6 groups, and we need 108 students for 12 groups, we can divide the total number of students needed for 12 groups by the number of students per group.

108 students / 9 students per group = 12 groups

Since we already know that 6 groups are needed for 54 students, we need to find out how many more groups are needed to reach 12 groups.

12 groups - 6 groups = 6 groups

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

First, she trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. 
Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading 27 small stickers.

Now, she has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. 
Since each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, she gets 20 large buttons from trading 20 large stickers.

Now, she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. 
Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from trading 20 large stickers.

Now, let's calculate the total number of buttons she has. 
She has 27 small buttons from trading small stickers, 20 large buttons from trading large stickers, and 60 small buttons from trading large stickers. 
So, the total number of buttons she has is 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 buttons.

Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as 'x'. Then, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 2x.

We know that the total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and against the new regulation. So, we can write the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Now that we know the number of votes against the new regulation is 11, we can find the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, which is twice the number of votes against it:

Votes in favor = 2x = 2 * 11 = 22

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides by 3:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can set up the equation:

2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

Total Puppies = 18 * (3/2)
Total Puppies = 27

"Let's break down the information given. We know that the total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. We also know that the first house needs 1/2 of what the second house needs, and the third house needs double what the first house needs.

Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as 'x'. Then, the first house needs x/2 cases of shingles. The third house needs 2 times the first house, which is 2 * (x/2) = x.

We know that the sum of the cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. So, we can write the equation: x + (x/2) + x = 250.

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + x + 2x = 500.

Combine like terms: 5x = 500.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 100.

Now that we know the second house needs 100 cases of shingles, we can find the number of cases needed for the third house, which is x = 100.

The third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

Remaining time = Total time available - Time spent reading
Remaining time = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time:
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

Now, we can find the time spent playing soccer:
Time spent playing soccer = Remaining time - Time spent playing video games
Time spent playing soccer = 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we need to divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time available and multiply by 100:
Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (Time spent playing soccer / Total time available) * 100
Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps of the problem.

Anthony started with 50 pencils. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon. 

1/2 of 50 is 50 * 0.5 = 25. So, Anthony gave 25 pencils to Brandon. 

Now, Anthony has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.

He then gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. 

3/5 of 25 is 25 * 3/5 = 25 * 0.6 = 15. So, Anthony gave 15 pencils to Charlie.

Now, Anthony has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to drive to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Jack to drive to the museum:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time = 2 hours

Since he drives to the museum and back, we need to multiply the time by 2:

Total driving time = 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours

Now, we add the time he spends at the museum to the total driving time:

Total time = Total driving time + Time at the museum
Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time = 10 hours

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many wheels Henry will need in total, we need to calculate the number of wheels required for the cars and the motorcycles separately and then add them together.

For the cars, Henry needs 4 wheels for each of the 57 cars. So, the total number of wheels required for the cars is 57 * 4 = 228.

For the motorcycles, Henry needs 2 wheels for each of the 73 motorcycles. So, the total number of wheels required for the motorcycles is 73 * 2 = 146.

Now, we add the total number of wheels required for the cars and the motorcycles: 228 + 146 = 374.

Since Henry has a box with 650 wheels, we subtract the total number of wheels required from the total number of wheels available: 650 - 374 = 276.

The final answer is: 276"
"To find the amount you have to pay after the discount, we need to calculate 20% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

20% of $1000 is calculated as 0.20 * 1000 = $200.

Now, subtract the discount from the original price: $1000 - $200 = $800.

So, you have to pay $800 after the discount.

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we need to calculate the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the remaining movies.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. A third of the movies are in series, so we can calculate this as:

600 / 3 = 200 movies in series

Since Mike can get these movies for only $6 of the cost of a normal movie, we can calculate the cost of the series as:

200 * $6 = $1200

Next, let's find the number of older movies. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we need to find the number of remaining movies first. We subtract the movies in series from the total number of movies:

600 - 200 = 400 remaining movies

Then, we find 40% of the remaining movies:

400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies

The cost of the older movies is:

160 * $5 = $800

Now, we need to find the number of remaining movies that are not in series and not older movies. We subtract the movies in series and older movies from the total number of movies:

600 - 200 - 160 = 240 remaining movies

The cost of the remaining movies is:

240 * $10 = $2400

Finally, we add up the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the remaining movies to find the total cost:

$1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400

The final answer is: $4400"

The cost of plums is 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00
The cost of apricots is 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, let's add the costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

The final answer is: $38.00"
"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we first need to calculate the distance they covered while driving and hiking. 

The Llesis family drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour for 6 hours. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 * 6
Distance = 300 miles

Now, we need to find the speed at which they hiked. It's given that they hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. 

Half their driving speed = 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour
Hiking speed = 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour

They hiked for 1.5 hours. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 20 * 1.5
Distance = 30 miles

Now, we add the distance covered while driving and hiking to find the total distance to their vacation spot.

Total Distance = Distance while driving + Distance while hiking
Total Distance = 300 + 30
Total Distance = 330 miles

The final answer is: 330"
"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the points each of them gets from enemies, berries, and the timer.

Let's assume Emma's score from enemies is x. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava's score from enemies will be x + 8.

Emma's score from berries is 3 (since she collects 3 berries), and Ava collects 3 + 3 = 6 berries.

Now, let's consider the timer. The longer Ava takes, the lower her score will be. Since Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma, let's assume Emma finishes the level in t seconds. Then, Ava finishes in t + 4 seconds.

Emma's score from the timer is 30t, and Ava's score from the timer is 30(t + 4).

The total score for Emma is x + 3 + 30t, and the total score for Ava is x + 8 + 6 + 30(t + 4).

We can simplify Ava's total score to x + 8 + 6 + 30t + 120 = x + 134 + 30t.

Since we don't know the exact time taken by Emma, we can't find the exact scores. However, we can find the difference in their scores by subtracting Emma's score from Ava's score.

The difference in their scores is (x + 134 + 30t) - (x + 3 + 30t) = x - x + 134 - 3 + 30t - 30t = 131.

So, the difference in their scores is 131."
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that are already known. Since two pizzas cost 30 dollars each, the total cost for these two pizzas is 2 * 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract the cost of these two pizzas from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the total cost of the other two pizzas. The total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars, so the total cost of the other two pizzas is 64 - 60 = 4 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can find the cost of each pizza by dividing the total cost of the other two pizzas by 2. The cost of each of the other two pizzas is 4 / 2 = 2 dollars.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of times they ride their bikes on usual days and the number of times they ride on the two extra days.

On usual days, they ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days. So, the total number of times they ride on usual days is 3 * 5 = 15.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the number of times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times a day. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

Now, we add the total number of times they ride on usual days and the extra days to get the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week. 

15 (usual days) + 12 (extra days) = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"Let's break down the information given. Initially, Bob had 7 fish in his pond, with 3 being orange and 4 being white. 

Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as 'w' and the number of orange fish he bought as 'o'. 

When Bob added the fish to his pond, he had a total of 7 + w + o fish. The number of orange fish in the pond became 3 + o, and the number of white fish became 4 + w.

We are given that after adding the fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This can be represented as:

3 + o = 2(4 + w)

Simplifying the equation:

3 + o = 8 + 2w

Subtract 3 from both sides:

o = 5 + 2w

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, which is the sum of the white and orange fish he bought. This can be represented as:

w + o = 17

Substituting the expression for o from the previous equation:

w + (5 + 2w) = 17

Combine like terms:

3w + 5 = 17

Subtract 5 from both sides:

3w = 12

Divide both sides by 3:

w = 4

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

The final answer is: 4"
"To calculate the weekly fuel consumption, we need to determine the total miles driven per week and then divide it by the car's fuel efficiency.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven per week. Since Andy drives to work and back home every day from Monday to Friday, the total miles driven per day is 5 miles * 2 (to and from work) = 10 miles. 

The total miles driven per week is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Now, let's calculate the fuel consumption per week. The car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, so the fuel consumption per week is 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

Since the price of regular gas is $3/gallon, the weekly fuel cost is 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

The final answer is: $15"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Carrie had initially and then subtract the amount she spent.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie had initially. She was given 10 twenties and 140 quarters.

The value of 10 twenties is 10 x $20 = $200.
The value of 140 quarters is 140 x $0.25 = $35.

So, the total amount of money Carrie had initially is $200 + $35 = $235.

Carrie spent all the quarters, which is $35, and 3/5 of the twenties, which is 3/5 x $200 = $120.

The total amount of money Carrie spent is $35 + $120 = $155.

Therefore, the total amount of money she paid for lunch is $155.

The final answer is: $155."

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to determine the total percentage of smart TVs and analog TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 TVs. 
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 * 40 = 5 TVs.

The total number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold is 10 + 5 = 15 TVs.

Since the rest of the TVs are OLED, we subtract the total number of smart and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold: 40 - 15 = 25.

So, Samwell sold 25 OLED TVs.

"To find out how much money John is missing, we first need to determine how much the school will cover. Since the school is covering half the cost of the trip, we can calculate this as:

Total cost of the trip: $300
School's contribution: $300 / 2 = $150

Now, we know that John has $50 and the school is covering $150. To find out how much John is missing, we subtract the amount he has from the total amount he needs to cover:

Amount John needs to cover: $300 - $150 (school's contribution) = $150
Amount John has: $50
Amount John is missing: $150 - $50 = $100

The final answer is: $100"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out the temperature at night and then determine how many logs Carson needs to burn to reach the safe temperature of 32 degrees.

First, let's find the temperature at night. It's 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the day, and the day temperature is 45 degrees. 

Night temperature = Day temperature - 33
Night temperature = 45 - 33
Night temperature = 12 degrees

Since the pipes will freeze at 32 degrees, Carson needs to heat the house up from 12 degrees to 32 degrees. 

Temperature to be heated = 32 - 12
Temperature to be heated = 20 degrees

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we divide the temperature to be heated by the temperature each log heats up.

Number of logs = Temperature to be heated / Temperature per log
Number of logs = 20 / 5
Number of logs = 4

"To find the total number of seashells brought back, we first need to determine the number of groups formed and then calculate 3/5 of that number multiplied by 2.

First, let's find the number of groups formed. Since 90 people were split into 9-person groups, we can divide 90 by 9 to get the number of groups.

90 / 9 = 10

Now, we know that 3/5 of the groups brought back seashells. To find 3/5 of the total number of groups, we multiply 10 by 3/5.

10 * (3/5) = 6

Since each group that brought back seashells brought 2 seashells, we multiply the number of groups that brought seashells by 2.

6 * 2 = 12

"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans first. 

The original price of the jeans is $40, and they are 25% off. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (25% or 0.25).

Discount = Original Price * Discount Percentage
Discount = $40 * 0.25
Discount = $10

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price.

Discounted Price = Original Price - Discount
Discounted Price = $40 - $10
Discounted Price = $30

Since Mike pays with a $50 bill, we need to find out how much change he will get. To do this, we subtract the discounted price from the $50 bill.

Change = $50 - Discounted Price
Change = $50 - $30
Change = $20

So, Mike will have $20 left over after buying the jeans.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first find the total number of employees after three months. 

The company initially has 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. So, after one month, the total number of employees will be 200 + 20 = 220. 

After two months, the total number of employees will be 220 + 20 = 240. 

After three months, the total number of employees will be 240 + 20 = 260.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees. Each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month. 

The total amount of money paid to the initial 200 employees is 200 * $4000 = $800,000.

The total amount of money paid to the 20 new employees hired in the first month is 20 * $4000 = $80,000.

The total amount of money paid to the 20 new employees hired in the second month is 20 * $4000 = $80,000.

The total amount of money paid to the 20 new employees hired in the third month is 20 * $4000 = $80,000.

Now, we add the total amount of money paid to all employees: $800,000 + $80,000 + $80,000 + $80,000 = $1,140,000.

"To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we first need to calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours.

Billy's initial hourly wage was $10. After 2 months, he got a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new hourly wage $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. After another year, he got a raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final hourly wage $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Billy's total earnings after working 20 hours at $11.50 per hour would be 20 * $11.50 = $230.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, which was $10. So, Sally's starting salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. 

Sally's total earnings after working 20 hours at $10.50 per hour would be 20 * $10.50 = $210.

To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $230 - $210 = $20.

"To find the total number of trees planted by the students, we need to multiply the number of classes by the average number of students per class and then multiply the result by 1 (since each student plants 1 tree).

Total students = 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students
Total trees planted by students = 1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees

To find the total number of trees planted by the teachers, we need to multiply the number of classes by the average number of teachers per class and then multiply the result by 2 (since each teacher plants 2 trees).

Total teachers = 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers
Total trees planted by teachers = 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees

"To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. 

30% of 14 = 0.3 * 14 = 4.2

Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we'll consider the context of the problem. If Bubbles buys 5 stuffed goats, the percentage of stuffed goats will be 5/19, which is approximately 26.32%. This is less than 30%. If she buys 6 stuffed goats, the percentage of stuffed goats will be 6/19, which is approximately 31.58%. This is more than 30%. Therefore, Bubbles should buy 5 stuffed goats to get as close to 30% as possible.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total hours Kris has played and subtract that from the target of 30 hours.

First, let's calculate the hours Kris played in the first 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days. If Kris plays for half an hour every day, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in the first 2 weeks.

Next, let's calculate the hours Kris played in the next week. If Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in the next week.

Now, let's add the hours Kris played in both periods: 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we subtract the total hours played from the target of 30 hours: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

So, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement.

"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time.

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 miles/hour x 2 hours = 120 miles

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 70 miles/hour x 2 hours = 140 miles

Since the second car was initially passing the first car, we need to find the distance between them after 2 hours. The second car has traveled 140 miles, and the first car has traveled 120 miles. The distance between them is the difference between the two distances:
Distance = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we first need to determine how many square inches of mosaic he can make with the glass chips he has. 

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, and each bag holds 72 chips, we need to find out how many chips Milo has in total. 

Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, so he has 2 * 72 = 144 chips.

Now, we need to find out how many square inches of mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch, we divide the total number of chips by 12 to get the total square inches of mosaic Milo can make: 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall, and he can make 12 square inches of mosaic, we need to find out how long the mosaic can be. To do this, we need to find the square root of the total square inches, because the area of a rectangle (such as the mosaic) is length times width, and the height is the width. 

The square root of 12 is approximately 3.46. However, since the height is 3 inches, the length will be the square root of 12 divided by 3, which is approximately 1.15. 

However, since we are looking for the length of the mosaic, we need to multiply the square root of 12 by 3 to get the length, which is 3.46 * 3 = 10.38. 

However, we can't have a fraction of an inch in this context, so we round down to the nearest whole number. 

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount each group of students drank and add them together. 

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so the total amount they drank is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. 

16 students drank 2 quarts each, so the total amount they drank is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since we know there are 10 quarts of tea left, we can find the initial amount by adding the consumed amount to the remaining amount: 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we know that 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts. So, the initial amount of tea in gallons is 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Dale initially ordered 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150, but he didn't have that many, so he must have sold all the ones he had and some of the new ones he ordered. Since he ended up selling 150 candies, and he only had 100 initially, he must have sold 50 of the new candies he ordered.

So, the total number of candies he has now is the initial 100 plus the 50 new ones he ordered, minus the 50 he sold from the new order. That's 100 + 50 - 50 = 100.

Now, he needs to sell all the candies he has, which is 100. 

The final answer is: 0"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of each month and then subtract the initial number of students from it.

At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students.

- At the end of January, the number of students doubles, so there are 10 * 2 = 20 students.
- At the end of February, the number of students doubles again, so there are 20 * 2 = 40 students.
- At the end of March, the number of students doubles again, so there are 40 * 2 = 80 students.
- At the end of April, the number of students doubles again, so there are 80 * 2 = 160 students.
- At the end of May, the number of students doubles again, so there are 160 * 2 = 320 students.

Now, let's subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May to find the additional students: 320 - 10 = 310.

The final answer is: 310"
"To find the total number of branches Felix climbed, we need to divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch. 

Total money made: $105
Cost per branch: $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week, which has 5 days, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 5
Average branches per day = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers and then subtract the petals that were dropped.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 x 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 x 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 x 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 x 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, we need to subtract 4 petals (1 from each set) from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

The final answer is: 97"
"To find out how many marshmallows are left in the bag, we need to subtract the total number of marshmallows used and the ones dropped from the initial amount. 

John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores, so together they made 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores. This means they used 18 marshmallows. 

They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. 

So, the total number of marshmallows used or dropped is 18 + 3 = 21.

Now, let's subtract this from the initial amount of marshmallows: 35 - 21 = 14.

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the number of S'mores they can make with the remaining marshmallows is 14.

To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 (since there are two kids). 

14 / 2 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person plays and then determine how many quarters they use.

Jack can play for 20 minutes. His two friends who are worse can play for half as long, which is 20 / 2 = 10 minutes. The friend who is better can play for 1.5 times as long, which is 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes.

Since they play for 4 hours, we need to convert this to minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Now, let's calculate how many times each person can play within 240 minutes:

- Jack: 240 minutes / 20 minutes/game = 12 games
- The two worse friends: 240 minutes / 10 minutes/game = 24 games each
- The better friend: 240 minutes / 30 minutes/game = 8 games

The cost of a game is 1 quarter. So, the total number of quarters used is:
12 games (Jack) + 24 games (worse friend 1) + 24 games (worse friend 2) + 8 games (better friend) = 68 games

Since each game costs 1 quarter, the total amount of money used is 68 quarters.

68 quarters * 0.25 dollars/quarter = 17 dollars"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as Z, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of salt as S, the amount of sugar as S, and the amount of oil as O.

We know that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so F = Z.

We also know that she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so S = S.

We know that she uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.

We also know that she uses twice as much salt as zest, so S = 2Z.

Since F = Z, we can substitute F with Z in the equation S = 2Z, so S = 2Z.

Now we have O = 2S and S = 2Z. We can substitute S with 2Z in the equation O = 2S, so O = 2(2Z) = 4Z.

Since the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, the sum of all the ingredients is 10. So, Z + F + S + S + O = 10.

We can substitute F with Z and S with 2Z in the equation, so Z + Z + 2Z + 2Z + 4Z = 10.

Combine like terms, 10Z = 10.

Divide both sides by 10, Z = 1.

Now that we know Z = 1, we can find O. Since O = 4Z, O = 4(1) = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of the goats is 3 * $500 = $1500.
The cost of the cows is 2 * $1500 = $3000.

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

So, John spent $4500 in total. 

The final answer is: $4500"
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Paul needs 63 cupcakes in total. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, so the total number of cupcakes he has is 8 + 40 = 48.

Now, let's subtract the number of cupcakes he has from the total number of cupcakes he needs: 63 - 48 = 15.

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes. 

15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Robert has 20 cars. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, so Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2: 40 * 0.2 = 8. So, Joe sells 8 cars.

3. Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

4. Now, let's find out how many cars Joe has left. He started with 40 cars, sold 8, and gave away 16. So, he has 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars left.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to first determine the total amount raised by the students. Since the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, the amount raised by the students is $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Now, we know that there are 20 students and they all raised the same amount. To find out how much each student raised, we can divide the total amount raised by the students ($125,000) by the number of students (20).

$125,000 Ã· 20 = $6,250

Each student raised $6,250."
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day, then add them together.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time in minutes, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes
4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes

Now, we add the time from both days:
480 minutes + 240 minutes = 720 minutes

The final answer is: 720"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Hunter counted 50 cars in the parking lot when he entered class.

During the first break, he counted 20 more cars, so the total number of cars becomes 50 + 20 = 70.

When he got out of class for the lunch break, he realized that 1/2 the number of cars in the parking lot had gone. This means that 1/2 of 70 cars left, and the remaining 1/2 stayed.

To find the number of cars that left, we multiply 70 by 1/2: 70 * 1/2 = 35.

So, the number of cars that left is 35. Since the remaining 1/2 stayed, the number of cars that stayed is also 35.

Now, to find the total number of cars he counted during lunch break, we need to add the number of cars that left and the number of cars that stayed: 35 (left) + 35 (stayed) = 70.

The total number of cars he counted during lunch break is 70."
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 different tasks. So, the total number of tasks he completes in a day is 30 * 5 = 150 tasks.

Since each task pays $1.20, the total amount John makes in a day is 150 * $1.20 = $180.

John works a full 7-day week, so we need to multiply the daily earnings by 7 to find the total weekly earnings. 

$180 * 7 = $1260

The final answer is: $1260"
"To find the total points Sasha scored in both games, we need to calculate her points in each game and add them together.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game. Therefore, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored, we add her points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18.

"To find the total number of tins of cat food, we multiply the number of packages of cat food by the number of tins per package: 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

To find the total number of tins of dog food, we multiply the number of packages of dog food by the number of tins per package: 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of tins of cat food and dog food: 88 - 36 = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as 'x'. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards each person has. We can write the equation as x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341.

Combine like terms: 7x + 12 = 341.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329.

Divide both sides by 7: x = 47.

Since PJ has x cards, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has 3x cards, so Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards. Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has 3 * 47 + 12 = 147 cards.

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs and then add them together.

Cindy had 5 green eggs. 
She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.
She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and subtract the refund amount from the purchase price.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The book weighs 4 pounds and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound, so the weight-based shipping cost is 4 * $0.35 = $1.40. The book needs to be returned 20 miles away, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile, so the distance-based shipping cost is 20 * $0.08 = $1.60. The total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $2.99.

Now, let's calculate the refund amount. Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price, which is 0.75 * $32 = $24.

The total cost of shipping is $2.99, and the refund amount is $24. To find out how much Milly will lose, we subtract the refund amount from the shipping cost: $2.99 - $24 = -$21.91. However, since we can't lose a negative amount of money, we need to recalculate the refund amount as the difference between the shipping cost and the refund amount. 

The correct calculation is: $2.99 - $24 = -$21.01. However, since we can't lose a negative amount of money, we need to recalculate the refund amount as the difference between the shipping cost and the refund amount.

"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she spent and subtract it from the initial amount she had, including the money her father gave her.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Mulan had initially: $40 (initial money) + $100 (money from her father) = $140.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money she spent: 2 pairs of jeans at $30 each = 2 x $30 = $60, and a bag for $20. So, the total amount spent is $60 + $20 = $80.

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $140 - $80 = $60.

Mulan has $60 left."
"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for the first three weeks and then determine the pattern.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.
In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, we can find out how much he produces in the fourth week by subtracting the production of the first three weeks from the total production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

The final answer is: 14,000"
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on TikTok in a week and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on TikTok in a week:

- She records 18 videos, each taking 4 minutes. So, the total time spent recording videos is 18 * 4 = 72 minutes.
- She spends 2 hours writing songs, which is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.
- She spends 15 minutes each day for 6 days on makeup, so the total time spent on makeup is 15 * 6 = 90 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time spent on TikTok in a week: 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 282 minutes to hours: 282 / 60 = 4.7 hours.

Now, let's multiply the time spent on TikTok in a week by 4 to get the time spent in a month: 4.7 * 4 = 18.8 hours.

The final answer is: 18.8"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to find the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. However, Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. Since the initial installation already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier, we only need to consider the additional items.

Angela has 2 extra mirrors (6 - 4 = 2), 1 extra chandelier (2 - 1 = 1), and 10 extra pictures (20 - 10 = 10). The cost of the additional items is $15.00 per item.

The total number of additional items is 2 (mirrors) + 1 (chandelier) + 10 (pictures) = 13 items.

The cost of the additional items is 13 items * $15.00 per item = $195.00.

The initial installation cost is $129.00.

The total cost is $129.00 (initial installation) + $195.00 (additional items) = $324.00.

The final answer is: $324.00"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Eva has saved $20.00.
2. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.
3. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply $30.00 by 0.40, which is $12.00.
4. To find Roy's total savings, we add the 40% more to Anthony's savings: $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

The final answer is: $42.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain in relation to Pompei's lifting capacity. 

First, we know that Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, and Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. So, Saskay can lift a mountain 12 * 1 = 12 inches.

Next, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Finally, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 since there are 12 inches in a foot. 

480 / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total distance traveled by Mason, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours, and then add them together.

Distance = Speed x Time

For the first 4 hours:
Distance = 8 miles/hour x 4 hours = 32 miles

For the next 6 hours:
Distance = 8 miles/hour x 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the time it takes for one kangaroo to travel across the highway. Since three kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, one kangaroo would take three times as long, which is 18 * 3 = 54 hours.

Now, we know that the turtles travel at half the speed of a kangaroo. So, if one kangaroo takes 54 hours to travel across the highway, four turtles traveling at half the speed would take twice as long, which is 54 * 2 = 108 hours.

The final answer is: 108"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Kora made 20 dishes. Since Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora, Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes. 

Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

To find the total number of clay dishes they all made together, we add the number of dishes each person made: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140.

The final answer is: 140"
"Let's break down the information given. Erika's total savings after trading in her old laptop and receiving the discount is $600 - $200 = $400. She then received $150 from her part-time job and $80 from her mom, so the total amount of money she has is $400 + $150 + $80 = $630. 

Since she only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, we can subtract this from the total amount she has to find out how much money she had initially in her purse. 

$630 - $50 = $580

So, Erika had $580 in her purse initially."
"To find out how many slices Adam has left, we first need to calculate the total number of slices he made. 

For 3 large apples, each sliced into 5 pieces, Adam gets 3 * 5 = 15 slices. 
For 5 small apples, each sliced into 3 pieces, Adam gets 5 * 3 = 15 slices. 

In total, Adam has 15 + 15 = 30 slices. 

Since Adam eats 15 slices, we subtract the number of slices he ate from the total number of slices: 30 - 15 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the total amount of milk the farmer currently produces. 

The farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each cow, and he has 3 cows. So, the total amount of milk he currently produces is 5 liters/cow * 3 cows = 15 liters/day.

To find out how many more cows he needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we subtract the current production from the target production: 25 liters/day - 15 liters/day = 10 liters/day.

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we need to find out how many cows are needed to produce 10 liters of milk a day. We can do this by dividing the target production by the amount of milk each cow produces: 10 liters/day / 5 liters/cow = 2 cows.

The farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the used length of each glue stick and subtract it from the original length.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so the used length is 1 - 1/6 = 5/6 of the original length. 
The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so the used length is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3 of the original length.
The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so the used length is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2 of the original length.

Now, let's calculate the used length of each glue stick:
- First glue stick: 5/6 * 12 mm = 10 mm
- Second glue stick: 1/3 * 12 mm = 4 mm
- Third glue stick: 1/2 * 12 mm = 6 mm

The total used length is 10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is the original length minus the total used length:
12 mm - 20 mm = -8 mm

However, since we cannot have a negative length, this means that the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 0 mm, but this is incorrect because the question asks for the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, not the total length of the unused parts of the glue sticks. 

To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused length of each glue stick:
- First glue stick: 1/6 * 12 mm = 2 mm
- Second glue stick: 2/3 * 12 mm = 8 mm
- Third glue stick: 1/2 * 12 mm = 6 mm

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 2 mm + 8 mm + 6 mm = 16 mm.

"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy and subtract the amount of money he already has.

The total cost of the items is $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10080.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200, so he has a total of $5000 + $200 = $5200.

Now, let's subtract the amount of money Gabriel has from the total cost of the items: $10080 - $5200 = $3580.

So, Gabriel still needs $3580."

"To find out how much money Craig has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract that from the initial amount he had.

Craig initially had 2 twenty-dollar bills, which is 2 * $20 = $40.

He bought 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so the total cost of the squirt guns is 6 * $2 = $12.

He also bought 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so the total cost of the water balloons is 3 * $3 = $9.

The total amount he spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount he had: $40 - $21 = $19.

So, Craig has $19 left.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, and since Jack has an unknown number of socks, let's call it 'x'. So, Peter has 2x socks.
4. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so the number of socks Jack has is 60 / 2 = 30 socks.

Now, we know Jack has 30 socks and Peter has 2x socks. Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can set up the equation: 2x = 30. Solving for x, we get x = 15. So, Jack has 30 socks and Peter has 2x = 2 * 15 = 30 socks.

Now, let's find the total number of socks: 30 (Jack's socks) + 30 (Peter's socks) = 60 socks.

The total number of dishes is 60 (Jack's dishes) + 30 (Peter's dishes) = 90 dishes.

The total number of socks and dishes together is 60 socks + 90 dishes = 150.

The final answer is: 150"
"To find the number of students good at math, we need to consider the total number of students and the number of students good at both subjects. 

Let's denote the number of students good at both math and English as 'x'. We know that the total number of students is 20, and the number of students good at math only is 5, and the number of students good at English only is 8.

We can set up an equation based on the total number of students: 
5 (math only) + 8 (English only) + x (both) = 20

Simplifying the equation, we get:
13 + x = 20

Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get:
x = 7

However, we are asked to find the number of students good at math. Since 'x' represents the number of students good at both subjects, we need to add the number of students good at math only (5) to 'x' to get the total number of students good at math.

Total number of students good at math = 5 (math only) + 7 (both) = 12

"To find out how many groups can perform, we need to calculate the total available time for performances. The concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes. 

We subtract the 10-minute intermission from the total time: 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Each group takes 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage. So, the total time taken by each group is 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes.

Now, we divide the available time for performances (110 minutes) by the time taken by each group (10 minutes): 110 / 10 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand that it's a simple interest scenario. The interest rate is 3/4 of the original amount, which can be expressed as 0.75 or 75% of the principal amount.

The formula for simple interest is: A = P(1 + rt), where A is the total amount, P is the principal amount, r is the interest rate, and t is the time period in years.

Given that the principal amount (P) is $300, the interest rate (r) is 0.75, and the time period (t) is 3 years, we can plug these values into the formula:

A = 300(1 + 0.75*3)
A = 300(1 + 2.25)
A = 300(3.25)
A = 975

So, after 3 years, Brenda will have a total of $975.

"To find out how much the farmer will earn, we need to determine how many trays he can fill with 900 eggs. 

Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray to find the number of trays.

Number of trays = Total eggs / Eggs per tray
= 900 / 30
= 30 trays

Now, we know the farmer has 30 trays. To find out how much he will earn, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray.

Earnings = Number of trays * Price per tray

"To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we first need to determine how many goats were sold from each farm. 

From Farm X, Mr. Smith sold 10 goats. 
From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as from Farm X, which is 2 * 10 = 20 goats.

Now, let's calculate the number of goats left in each farm. 
In Farm X, he had 55 goats initially and sold 10, so he has 55 - 10 = 45 goats left.
In Farm Y, he had 45 goats initially and sold 20, so he has 45 - 20 = 25 goats left.

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the number of goats left in each farm: 45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70.

"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount he spends on shoes in a year by the number of pairs he buys in a year.

First, let's find out how many pairs of shoes James buys in a year. Since he buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, we multiply this by 12 months:

2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

Now, we divide the total amount he spends on shoes in a year ($2640) by the number of pairs he buys in a year (24):

$2640 / 24 pairs = $110 per pair

"Let's break down the information given:

1. I am three years younger than my brother, so if my age is x, my brother's age is x + 3.
2. I am 2 years older than my sister, so my sister's age is x - 2.
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so my mom's age is 3(x + 3) - 1.
4. When you add all our ages, you get 87: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 
x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87
Combine x terms: 
6x + 9 = 87

Subtract 9 from both sides: 
6x = 78

Divide both sides by 6: 
x = 13

So, I am 13 years old.

"To find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of glue sticks required for the students. Since each student needs 2 glue sticks, we multiply the number of students by 2.

Total glue sticks needed = 27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks needed by 8 to find out how many packs are required.

Number of packs needed = Total glue sticks needed / Number of glue sticks per pack

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at the given point over the three days.

On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point over the three days, we need to add the amounts from each day: 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000 gallons.

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 24000 gallons.

The final answer is: 24000"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. Since each infected person infects six others, we can model the growth of the infected population using a geometric progression.

Let's denote the initial number of infected people as P0 = 10. The number of new infections each day can be calculated as 6 times the number of infected people from the previous day.

Day 1: P1 = P0 + 6P0 = 10 + 6(10) = 10 + 60 = 70
Day 2: P2 = P1 + 6P1 = 70 + 6(70) = 70 + 420 = 490
Day 3: P3 = P2 + 6P2 = 490 + 6(490) = 490 + 2940 = 3430

Therefore, the total number of people infected after three days is 3430.

"To find out how much money Julieta received, we need to calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips and subtract that from Rafaela's total tips. 

First, let's find out how much money Rafaela received. Since each customer gave her a $20 tip, and there were 40 customers, Rafaela's total tips would be 40 * $20 = $800.

Now, let's calculate 10% of $800. 10% of $800 is 0.1 * $800 = $80.

Since Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela, we need to subtract $80 from Rafaela's total tips. So, Julieta's total tips would be $800 - $80 = $720.

Now, let's find the total tips for both Julieta and Rafaela. Total tips = Rafaela's tips + Julieta's tips = $800 + $720 = $1520.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Claire earns 1 badge per month.
- Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.
- Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), the number of badges earned by each girl would be:

- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 1/2 badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:

In 1 hour, Paige can bake 2 loaves, and each loaf is cut into 8 slices. So, in 1 hour, she can bake 2 * 8 = 16 slices. 

In 5 hours, she can bake 16 * 5 = 80 slices. 

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, so we need to convert the total number of slices to dollars. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can divide the total number of slices by 100 to get the total amount in dollars. 

80 slices / 100 = 0.8 dollars per slice. 

Now, we multiply the number of slices by the price per slice to get the total amount raised. 

80 slices * 0.5 dollars/slice = 40 dollars.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we first need to determine the number of silver coins she has. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, and she has 70 gold coins, we can set up an equation to find the number of silver coins.

Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'. We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 70

To solve for 'x', we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

x = 70 - 30
x = 40

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. To find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and silver coins:

Total coins = 70 (gold coins) + 40 (silver coins)
Total coins = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we first need to determine the total number of burritos consumed. 

There were 50 students at the picnic, and each student was given 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Mr. George also ate 20 burritos. 

The total number of burritos consumed is 500 (given to students) + 20 (eaten by Mr. George) = 520.

Since there were 600 burritos ordered initially, the total number of leftover burritos is 600 - 520 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the number of yellow cars, we first need to determine the number of green and blue cars. 

We know there are 12 red cars. The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we know the total number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52.

Since the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S.

We know that together, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books. This can be expressed as:
S + A + F = 85

We also know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, which can be expressed as:
S = A + 25

We also know that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, which can be expressed as:
A = F - 12

Now, we can substitute the expression for S from the second equation into the first equation:
(A + 25) + A + F = 85

Combine like terms:
2A + F + 25 = 85

Subtract 25 from both sides:
2A + F = 60

Now, substitute the expression for A from the third equation into the equation above:
2(F - 12) + F = 60

Expand the equation:
2F - 24 + F = 60

Combine like terms:
3F - 24 = 60

Add 24 to both sides:
3F = 84

Divide both sides by 3:
F = 28

The final answer is: 28"
"To find out how many pounds of carrots Daisy bought, we first need to determine the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weighed 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weighed 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

Next, we need to find the weight of the carrots. The carrots weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the weight of the carrots is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find out how much Greg will spend on Jello, we first need to determine how many Jello cups he needs to buy. Since there will be 30 kids and each kid will have 4 Jello cups, we multiply the number of kids by the number of cups each kid will have: 30 kids * 4 cups/kid = 120 cups.

Since one 3-ounce box of Jello makes 10 small Jello cups, we need to find out how many boxes Greg needs to buy. We divide the total number of cups needed by the number of cups one box makes: 120 cups / 10 cups/box = 12 boxes.

Now, we need to find out how much one box costs. The price of one box is $1.25. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of boxes by the price per box: 12 boxes * $1.25/box = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find out how much change the seller will give back, we need to calculate the total cost of the phones and subtract that from the $4000 given by the customer.

The total cost of the phones is 5 phones * $700 per phone = $3500.

Now, we subtract the total cost from the $4000 given by the customer: $4000 - $3500 = $500.

So, the seller will give back $500 in change. 

The final answer is: $500"
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to determine how much Keenan spends in a month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

First, let's calculate Keenan's monthly expenditure: 
40% of $400 = 0.4 * $400 = $160

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can find out how much Keenan spends per week by dividing his monthly expenditure by 4:
$160 / 4 = $40

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he ate on each day and add them up.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and divide by 5:
60 * 2 = 120
120 / 5 = 24

So, on the first day, he ate 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. To find the remaining pieces after the first two days, we subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26

Now, we need to find 7/13 of 26:
26 * 7 = 182
182 / 13 = 14.15 (round to 14, since you can't eat a fraction of a piece)

So, on the third day, he ate 14 pieces.

Now, let's add up the pieces eaten on each day:
24 (first day) + 10 (second day) + 14 (third day) = 48

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we first need to determine the cost per bottle of soda and the cost per bottle of water.

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so the cost per bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00 per bottle.

The cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the cost per bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00 per bottle.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:

Cost of 3 bottles of soda = 3 * $3.00 = $9.00
Cost of 2 bottles of water = 2 * $2.00 = $4.00
Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

The total cost will be $13.00."
"To find out how much money David has left after buying the bolts, we need to calculate the total cost of the bolts and subtract that from the initial amount of money he has.

The cost of each bolt is $0.03, and David wants to buy 16 bolts. 

Total cost of bolts = Number of bolts * Cost per bolt
Total cost of bolts = 16 * $0.03
Total cost of bolts = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost of the bolts from the initial amount of money David has:

Initial amount of money = $12.48
Total cost of bolts = $0.48
Money left = Initial amount of money - Total cost of bolts
Money left = $12.48 - $0.48
Money left = $12.00

"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours, we need to determine her hourly rate. We can do this by dividing the amount she earned by the number of hours she worked.

Ella earned $33 for 3 hours of work. 

Hourly rate = Total earnings / Number of hours worked
Hourly rate = $33 / 3 hours
Hourly rate = $11 per hour

Now that we know her hourly rate, we can calculate her earnings for 12 hours.

Earnings for 12 hours = Hourly rate * Number of hours worked
Earnings for 12 hours = $11 per hour * 12 hours
Earnings for 12 hours = $132

The final answer is: $132"
"To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Paul has 52 marbles. His friend gave him 28 marbles, so now he has 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.

Then, he lost 1/4 of his marbles. To find 1/4 of 80, we multiply 80 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing 80 by 4. 

80 / 4 = 20

So, Paul lost 20 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has left, we subtract 20 from the total number of marbles he had after receiving the gift from his friend.

80 - 20 = 60

Therefore, Paul has 60 marbles left.

"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points she scored from each type of question and add them together.

First, let's calculate the points from the multiple-choice questions. Amy correctly answers 80% of the 10 multiple-choice questions, so she answers 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions correctly. Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, she scores 8 points from the multiple-choice questions.

Next, let's calculate the points from the true/false questions. Amy correctly answers 90% of the 20 true/false questions, so she answers 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions correctly. Since each true/false question is worth 1 point, she scores 18 points from the true/false questions.

Finally, let's calculate the points from the long-answer questions. Amy correctly answers 60% of the 5 long-answer questions, so she answers 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions correctly. Since each long-answer question is worth 5 points, she scores 3 * 5 = 15 points from the long-answer questions.

"To find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we first need to determine how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them, we can calculate the number of chickens he plans to sell as follows:

Number of chickens to sell = 300 * (3/5)
= 300 * 0.6
= 180 chickens

Now, we know that Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 per chicken. To find the total revenue, we multiply the number of chickens by the price per chicken:

Total revenue = 180 * $50
= $9000

Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, we can set up an equation to find the total cost of the chickens:

Total revenue - Total cost = Profit
$9000 - Total cost = $2000
Total cost = $9000 - $2000
Total cost = $7000

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens for $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"
"To find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 2, since they sold an equal number. 

Total glasses sold = 32
Number of people who sold an equal number of glasses = 2 (Micah and Mitchell)
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = Total glasses sold / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16

Since Julie sold 14 glasses, we can find out how many more glasses she sold than Micah by subtracting the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold.

Glasses sold by Julie = 14
Glasses sold by Micah = 16
Difference = Glasses sold by Julie - Glasses sold by Micah = 14 - 16 = -2

"To find out how much Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them up.

First, let's find the cost of the manicure. Since Iris spent 1/4 as much on the manicure as she did on her hair, and she spent $400 on her hair, the cost of the manicure is 1/4 * $400 = $100.

Next, let's find the cost of the pedicure. Since Iris spent 3/4 as much on the pedicure as she did on her manicure, and the manicure cost $100, the cost of the pedicure is 3/4 * $100 = $75.

Now, let's add up the costs of all three services: hair ($400), manicure ($100), and pedicure ($75). 

$400 + $100 + $75 = $575

"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope, we need to calculate the total amount of money she gets from selling the rope and then subtract the cost of the new rope.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Sarah gets from selling the rope. The rope is 20 meters long, and her friend is buying it for $2 a meter. 

Total money from selling the rope = Length of the rope * Price per meter
Total money from selling the rope = 20 * $2
Total money from selling the rope = $40

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 a meter, and Sarah wants to buy a rope of the same length (20 meters).

Cost of the new rope = Length of the new rope * Price per meter
Cost of the new rope = 20 * $1.5
Cost of the new rope = $30

Now, let's subtract the cost of the new rope from the total money Sarah gets from selling the rope to find out how much money she will have left over.

Money left over = Total money from selling the rope - Cost of the new rope
Money left over = $40 - $30
Money left over = $10

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Melanie's current age. Since in 10 years, she will be 18 years old, we can subtract 10 from 18 to find her current age.

Current age = 18 - 10 = 8 years

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let's assume the number of years is 'x'. 

In 'x' years, her age will be 8 + x. This age should be thrice her current age, which is 3 * 8 = 24.

So, we can set up the equation: 8 + x = 24

Now, we can solve for 'x' by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation.

x = 24 - 8
x = 16

Therefore, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age in 16 years.

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's find the cost of the chicken. Since each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and the 5 packs of bacon cost $10, the cost of one pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2. Therefore, the cost of one pack of chicken is $2 * 2 = $4. Since Kelly has 6 packs of chicken, the total cost of the chicken is 6 * $4 = $24.

Next, let's find the cost of the strawberries. Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of the strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

Now, let's find the cost of the apples. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. Since Kelly has 7 packs of apples, the total cost of the apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Finally, let's subtract the total cost of the items from Kelly's budget: $65 (budget) - $60 (total cost) = $5.

"Let's break down the information given. Elaina's final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, and the total runtime of the final concert, including the encore, is 65 minutes. 

Let's denote the runtime of her usual concerts as 'x'. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, its runtime would be 2x. 

The total runtime of the final concert, including the encore, is 65 minutes. This can be represented as: 2x + 15 = 65.

To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate it. Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 65 - 15. 

2x = 50

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for 'x': x = 50 / 2.

x = 25

The runtime of her usual concerts is 25 minutes.

"To find the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged, we first need to find the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs. 

Let's assume the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is 'x'. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is 2x.

However, we know that the singer has 50 microphones in total. Since 20% of the microphones won't find any space to fit in, the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is 80% of 50, which is 0.8 * 50 = 40.

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged is 40 / 2 = 20.

"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate the number of birds in each group and add them together.

First, let's find the number of birds nesting in the bushes: 6 birds.

Next, we need to find 2/3 of the number of birds nesting in the bushes. To do this, we multiply 6 by 2/3, which is the same as multiplying 6 by 2 and then dividing by 3. 

6 * 2 = 12
12 / 3 = 4

So, 2/3 of the number of birds nesting in the bushes is 4. Since Jerry also sees 4 birds flying overhead, we add these to the number of birds nesting in the bushes: 6 + 4 = 10.

Now, let's find the number of birds feeding. Jerry sees 3 groups of 8 birds each, so we multiply 3 by 8 to find the total number of birds feeding: 3 * 8 = 24.

Finally, we add the number of birds nesting, flying, and feeding to find the total number of birds: 6 + 10 + 24 = 40.

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to determine the speed of the thingamabob first. Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can find the speed of the thingamabob by dividing the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11.

Speed of thingamabob = Speed of whatchamacallit / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig by multiplying the speed of the thingamabob by 5.

Speed of whirligig = Speed of thingamabob * 5
Speed of whirligig = 11 * 5
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of the salad and the yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9. 

Since Ellen pays a total of $11 for her daily goods, and the salad and yogurt cost $9, the cost of two carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.

To find the cost of one carrot, we divide the cost of two carrots by 2. So, the cost of one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

"Let's break down the information given. We know that Tasha made $80 in total from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. We also know that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. Then, the number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn is 3x, and the number of times she mowed Alba's lawn is 5x.

The total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns is the sum of the payments from Joe, Kamala, and Alba. Since we know Joe paid $6, we can express the total amount from mowing lawns as 6 + 3x*6 + 5x*6.

We can simplify this expression to 6 + 18x + 30x, which is 48x + 6.

We know that the total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns and lemonade is $80. So, we can set up the equation 48x + 6 + lemonade_sales = 80.

To find the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to isolate lemonade_sales. We can do this by subtracting 48x + 6 from both sides of the equation.

lemonade_sales = 80 - 48x - 6

We also know that Tasha mowed Joe's lawn x times, Kamala's lawn 3x times, and Alba's lawn 5x times. Since we know Joe paid $6, we can set up the equation 6 + 3(6)x + 5(6)x = 48x + 6.

Simplifying this equation, we get 6 + 18x + 30x = 48x + 6.

Combine like terms: 48x + 6 = 48x + 6.

This equation is true for all values of x, so we can't find a specific value for x. However, we can still find the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales.

We can rewrite the equation 48x + 6 + lemonade_sales = 80 as 48x + lemonade_sales = 74.

Subtract 48x from both sides: lemonade_sales = 74 - 48x.

However, we still can't find a specific value for x. But we can express the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales in terms of x.

Since we can't find a specific value for x, we need to find a different approach. We know that Tasha made $80 in total and $6 from mowing Joe's lawn. So, the amount she made from mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns is 80 - 6 = 74.

We also know that the amount she made from mowing Kamala's lawn is 3 times the amount she made from mowing Joe's lawn, and the amount she made from mowing Alba's lawn is 5 times the amount she made from mowing Joe's lawn.

Let's denote the amount she made from mowing Joe's lawn as 'y'. Then, the amount she made from mowing Kamala's lawn is 3y, and the amount she made from mowing Alba's lawn is 5y.

We know that the total amount she made from mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns is 74. So, we can set up the equation 3y + 5y = 74.

Combine like terms: 8y = 74.

Divide both sides by 8: y = 9.25.

We know that y is the amount Tasha made from mowing Joe's lawn, which is $6. However, this is not true. This means our initial assumption that y is the amount Tasha made from mowing Joe's lawn is incorrect.

Let's try a different approach. We know that the amount Tasha made from mowing Kamala's lawn is 3 times the amount she made from mowing Joe's lawn, and the amount she made from mowing Alba's lawn is 5 times the amount she made from mowing Joe's lawn.

Let's denote the amount she made from mowing Joe's lawn as 'y'. Then, the amount she made from mowing Kamala's lawn is 3y, and the amount she made from mowing Alba's lawn is 5y.

We know that the total amount she made from mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns is 74 - 6 = 68.

We can set up the equation 3y + 5y = 68.

Combine like terms: 8y = 68.

Divide both sides by 8: y = 8.5.

We know that y is the amount Tasha made from mowing Joe's lawn, which is not true. This means our initial assumption that y is the amount Tasha made from mowing Joe's lawn is incorrect.

Let's try a different approach. We know that the amount Tasha made from mowing Kamala's lawn is 3 times the amount she made from mowing Joe's lawn, and the amount she made from mowing Alba's lawn is 5 times the amount she made from mowing Joe's lawn.

"To find Harry's weight, we need to calculate the weights of Carl and Christian first. 

Martin's weight is 55 kg. 
Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

"To find John's total monthly income from renting out his car, we need to calculate the total number of hours he rents his car and multiply it by his hourly rate.

He rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so the total number of hours is 10 * 3 = 30 hours.

His hourly rate is $25, so his total monthly income is 30 hours * $25/hour = $750.

To find his profit, we need to subtract his car payment from his total monthly income. 

Profit = Total monthly income - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500
Profit = $250

The final answer is: $250"
"Let's break down the information given. Martha initially had some notebooks, but we don't know the exact number. However, we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha. 

Let's represent the number of notebooks Martha had initially as 'x'. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, Joseph had 3x notebooks.

Martha bought 5 more notebooks, and now she has a total of 7 notebooks. This means that the initial number of notebooks she had (x) plus the 5 she bought equals 7. So, we can write the equation as x + 5 = 7.

To find the value of x, we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation: x = 7 - 5, which gives us x = 2. 

Now that we know Martha had 2 notebooks initially, we can find out how many notebooks Joseph had. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has: 7 - 6 = 1.

"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we first need to determine the distance rowed by Anis. 

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find 1/5 of Dijana's distance, we multiply 50 by 1/5, which is 10 miles. 

So, Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles. 

Now, to find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we add their individual distances: 50 (Dijana) + 60 (Anis) = 110 miles.

The final answer is: 110"
"To find out how many cookies each of Susan's nephews will get, we first need to determine the total number of cookies left after her husband took some. 

Initially, Susan had 100 cookies. Her husband took 4 cookies, so we subtract 4 from 100 to get the remaining cookies: 100 - 4 = 96.

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews, which is 6. 

To do this, we'll divide 96 by 6: 96 Ã· 6 = 16.

So, each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies.

"To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we first need to determine how many pages each of them read in total. 

Denise read 10 pages yesterday and 5 more than Daniel's yesterday's reading today. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today. 

So, Denise's total reading is 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages. 

Daniel read 13 pages yesterday and 0 pages today, so his total reading is 13 pages.

The difference in their total reading is 28 (Denise's total) - 13 (Daniel's total) = 15 pages.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bowls of soup will be used for dinner and then find out how many bowls of soup will be left. 

For dinner, there are 3 adults and 2 children, so a total of 5 people. Since each person eats one bowl, 5 bowls will be used for dinner. 

The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since 5 people are eating, and 4 adult bowls are equivalent to 5 people, we can assume that the pot can fill 5 bowls for dinner. 

Now, let's calculate the number of bowls left. The pot can fill 8 child bowls, and 5 bowls will be used for dinner. So, the number of bowls left is 8 - 5 = 3. 

Since each child eats one bowl for dinner, there will be 3 bowls left for the children to eat for lunch. There are 2 children, so each child will be able to have 3 / 2 = 1.5 bowls of soup for lunch. However, since you can't have half a bowl, we can say that each child will be able to have 1 bowl of soup for lunch and the remaining 1 bowl will be left over.

Now, let's add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen together: $7.50 + $0.5 = $8.

So, William spent $8 in total."
"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to calculate the total amount of material required for small and large masks separately and then add them together.

For small masks: 
- Each small mask requires 2 yards of material.
- Jo needs to make 20 small masks.
- Total material for small masks = 20 * 2 = 40 yards.

For large masks: 
- Each large mask requires 2.25 yards of material.
- Jo needs to make 8 large masks.
- Total material for large masks = 8 * 2.25 = 18 yards.

Total material required = material for small masks + material for large masks = 40 + 18 = 58 yards.

"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to first find the total number of tickets she bought and the total amount she spent. 

Since Deepa saw each of the 9 movies three times, the total number of tickets she bought is 9 movies * 3 showings per movie = 27 tickets.

The total amount she spent is given as $216.

To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets: $216 / 27 tickets.

Average price per ticket = $216 / 27 tickets = $8.

"To find out how much free time Harold has left in his day, we need to calculate the total hours in a day and subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

There are 24 hours in a day. 

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night. 
He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours a day.
He walks his dog for 1 hour a day.

Total hours spent on these activities: 10 (sleep) + 8 (work) + 1 (walking dog) = 19 hours.

Free time left in a day = Total hours in a day - Total hours spent on activities

Now, let's find out how many blue shoeboxes are left. 
Total blue shoeboxes = 7
Blue shoeboxes used = 3
Blue shoeboxes left = 7 - 3 = 4

Now, let's find out how many red shoeboxes are left. 
Total red shoeboxes = 9

18 - 2 = 16

Joseph currently has 16 books."
"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we first need to calculate how many marbles he gave away. 

Dean gives 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie. Since he has 30 marbles, we multiply 30 by 1/5 to find out how many marbles he gave to Jamie. 

30 * 1/5 = 30 / 5 = 6 marbles given to Jamie.

Dean also gives 10 marbles to Donald.

So, in total, Dean gave away 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we subtract the marbles he gave away from the total number of marbles he had initially.

30 (initial marbles) - 16 (marbles given away) = 14 marbles left for Dean.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write an equation:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 2 * Adam's age four years ago
Duncan's age eight years ago = 2x

We know that Duncan's current age is 60, so we can find his age eight years ago by subtracting 8 from 60:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 60 - 8
Duncan's age eight years ago = 52

Now we can equate this to 2x:

52 = 2x

To find x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 52 / 2
x = 26

This means Adam's age four years ago was 26. To find Adam's current age, we add 4 to x:

Adam's current age = x + 4
Adam's current age = 26 + 4
Adam's current age = 30

Finally, to find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = Adam's current age + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 38

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. Twice that would be 2 * 200 = 400 acres. 

Adding 100 acres to that gives us 400 + 100 = 500 acres for Farmer Smith's farm.

Now, to find the total number of acres of both farms, we add the acres of Farmer Brown's farm to the acres of Farmer Smith's farm: 200 + 500 = 700 acres.

"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to calculate the total number of packages he completes in that time and then multiply it by his hourly wage.

First, let's find out how many packages Colby completes in an hour. He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so we can write this as 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total number of packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. This is 40 packages/hour * 8 hours = 320 packages.

Since Colby gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes, we can multiply the total number of packages by his hourly wage to find his total earnings: 320 packages * $0.20/package = $64.

"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the time it takes to solve the extreme sudoku and then divide it by the time it takes him to drink a bottle of water.

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so the time to solve an extreme sudoku is 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to convert the time to solve the extreme sudoku to hours and then divide by 0.5 (since there are 2 half hours in an hour). 

180 minutes is equal to 3 hours. 

Now, we divide 3 hours by 0.5 to get the number of half hours, which is 6. 

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, he drinks 6 bottles of water in 3 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the red balloons and then subtract that from the total number of bologna pieces to find out how many were thrown at the yellow balloons.

Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and there are 20 red balloons, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

Now, we know that Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna at the bundle of balloons. To find out how many pieces were thrown at the yellow balloons, we subtract the number of pieces thrown at the red balloons from the total: 58 - 40 = 18.

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we can find the number of yellow balloons by dividing the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons by 3: 18 / 3 = 6.

So, there are 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

Since Jon drives 100 miles a day, the total miles driven in 30 days is 100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles.

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs.

3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of money Julia and Nadine had, and then divide it by 2 to find out how much each of them received as allowance.

First, let's find the cost of the balloons. 1 dozen balloons is equal to 12 balloons. Since 2 balloons cost $0.5, 12 balloons will cost 12 * $0.5 = $6.

The total cost of the cake and the balloons is $11 + $6 = $17.

They also bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so the total cost of the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total cost of the cake, balloons, and ice cream is $17 + $14 = $31.

Since they spent $31 out of the total amount of money they had, the remaining money is the amount they received as allowance. Let's call this amount 'x'. So, x - $31 = x.

Now, we know that they had x dollars in total, and they spent $31, so the amount each of them received as allowance is x / 2.

We also know that the remaining money after spending $31 is equal to the amount each of them received as allowance. So, x - $31 = x / 2.

To find the value of x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get 2x - 62 = x.

Now, let's isolate x by subtracting x from both sides of the equation: x - 62 = 0.

Now, add 62 to both sides of the equation: x = 62.

So, the total amount of money Julia and Nadine's mother gave them is $62.

The amount each of them received as allowance is $62 / 2 = $31.

The cost of each lollipop is $0.5, and the total number of lollipops sold is 300. So, the total cost of the lollipops is 0.5 * 300 = $150.

The selling price of each lollipop is $0.8, and the total number of lollipops sold is 300. So, the total revenue from selling the lollipops is 0.8 * 300 = $240.

The profit made by the class is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost, which is 240 - 150 = $90.

Therefore, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and then add them up.

Larry has 3 cats.

He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47

The final answer is: 47"
"To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to determine how many slices each person eats per day and then calculate the total number of slices they eat together per day.

Abby eats 2 slices a day. 
Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 * 2 = 4 slices a day.

Together, they eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices a day.

The loaf of bread has 24 slices. To find out how many days it will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat per day: 24 / 6 = 4.

The loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"To find out how many shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and we want to know the total by her 10th birthday, we need to consider the months from her 5th birthday to her 10th birthday.

There are 12 months in a year. From her 5th birthday to her 10th birthday, Martha would have been 5 years old for 1 year, 6 years old for 1 year, 7 years old for 1 year, 8 years old for 1 year, and 9 years old for 1 year. 

So, the total number of months is 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

Since Martha collects one shell every month, the total number of shells she has collected by her 10th birthday is 60 shells.

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cups of tea are in each row. Since Lana divides the 27 cups into 3 rows, we can divide 27 by 3 to get the number of cups in each row.

27 cups / 3 rows = 9 cups per row

Since Lana creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row will be half of the total cups in each row.

9 cups per row / 2 = 4.5 cups of mint tea per row

However, since we can't have a fraction of a cup, we can assume that Lana will make whole cups of tea. This means that she will make 4 cups of mint tea in each row and 5 cups of chamomile tea in each row, as the total number of cups in each row is 9.

4 cups of mint tea per row"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip. 

Let's break down the information given: 

- The sloth takes 4 hours to make a round trip (down and back up) to collect berries.
- The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

Since the sloth takes 4 hours for a round trip, in 8 hours, he can make 8 / 4 = 2 round trips.

If he makes 2 round trips, he will collect a total of 2 * x berries, where x is the number of berries he picks up per trip.

We want this total to be 24 berries, so we can set up the equation: 2 * x = 24.

To find the minimum number of berries he can pick up per trip, we need to solve for x.

x = 24 / 2
x = 12

So, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the initial amount of water in the tank. Since Anthony and his father fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool, we can calculate this as follows:

Initial water in the pool = 10000 gallons
Water in the tank = 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons

Next, we need to find out how much water is used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so we can calculate the total water used as follows:

Water used per day = 500 gallons
Total days = 6
Total water used = 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons

Now, we can find the remaining water in the tank by subtracting the total water used from the initial amount of water in the tank:

Remaining water in the tank = Initial water in the tank - Total water used
= 5000 - 3000
= 2000 gallons

The final answer is: 2000"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much money Colby has left and then determine how many movies he can see with the remaining money.

Colby's initial budget is $150. He has already spent money on:

- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total money spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Colby has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Since tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10, and he wants to see a movie on a Friday, he can see 1 more movie with his remaining money.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked, we first need to calculate the calories of each type of mini pastry. 

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories. 

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, we can calculate the total calories of each type of pastry. The total calories of the mini cinnamon rolls are 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories. The total calories of the mini blueberry muffins are 150 * 300 = 45,000 calories.

The total calories of all the pastries are 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

The final answer is: 85000"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed and then divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, so 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Tuesday, so 2 * 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378

There are 5 days in total. 

Average number of Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days
= 378 / 5
= 75.6

"To find out how far each vehicle traveled, we need to multiply their speeds by the time they traveled.

The bus traveled 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it covered is 60 * 5 = 300 miles.

The car traveled 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it covered is 30 * 8 = 240 miles.

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus. 

300 - 240 = 60 miles.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls from the total number of toys she has now.

The total number of toys before buying the bouncy balls is the sum of the blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings. 

Total number of toys before = 31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48

Now, we subtract this from the total number of toys after buying the bouncy balls to find the number of bouncy balls.

Number of bouncy balls = Total number of toys after - Total number of toys before
= 62 - 48
= 14

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old.
2. Paul is 10 years older than John.
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age.

Let's denote John's age as 'x'. Since Paul is 10 years older than John, Paul's age is 'x + 10'.

From the third point, we know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, which is (x + 10) + x = 2x + 10.

The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old, so we can write the equation: Peter + Paul + Jean = 100. 

Since Peter's age is 2x + 10 and Paul's age is x + 10, we can substitute these values into the equation: (2x + 10) + (x + 10) + Jean = 100.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Initially, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons. So, the total number of balloons given to her friends is 4 * 2 = 8. 

Maria also had 1 water balloon for herself. 

So, the total number of balloons at the start of the game is 8 (given to friends) + 1 (Maria's balloon) = 9.

Then, Maria's mom came out and gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (4 friends and Maria), the total number of additional balloons given is 5 * 3 = 15.

Now, we add the additional balloons to the initial total: 9 (initial balloons) + 15 (additional balloons) = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how many tables they need, we first need to calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have. 

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so they have 10 * 5 = 50 boxes from donations. 
They already have 10 boxes, so the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, they will need 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

They already own 15 tables, so they need 30 - 15 = 15 more tables.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance spat by each person and then divide it by the total number of seeds spat.

Zoey spits 40 seeds, each 10 feet, so the total distance spat by Zoey is 40 * 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney spits 35 seeds, each 12 feet, so the total distance spat by Sydney is 35 * 12 = 420 feet.

The total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney is 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

The total number of seeds spat is 40 + 35 = 75.

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance spat by the total number of seeds spat: 820 / 75 = 10.93 (rounded to two decimal places).

The final answer is: 10.93"
"To determine which widget maker is more profitable, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month and then multiply that by the price of each widget.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month. The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour and runs 24 hours a day. 

60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1440 widgets/day
1440 widgets/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets/month

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour and runs 24 hours a day.

45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1080 widgets/day
1080 widgets/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets/month

Now, let's calculate the total revenue for each machine. Each widget sells for $6.

Widgeteer 3000 revenue: 43,200 widgets/month * $6/widget = $259,200/month
WidgetMaster 9000 revenue: 32,400 widgets/month * $6/widget = $194,400/month

To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we subtract the revenue of the WidgetMaster 9000 from the revenue of the Widgeteer 3000.

$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

The final answer is: $64,800"
"To find out how much Cameron would save, we first need to calculate the cost of his stay with the option of adding 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark and then compare it to the cost of a 24-hour stay.

Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. Since the first 12 hours are already included in the initial charge, we need to calculate the cost of the additional 5 hours.

The cost of the additional 5 hours is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.

The total cost for Cameron's stay would be 1000 (initial 12-hour charge) + 350 (additional 5 hours) = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of a 24-hour stay, which is 1600 pesos.

The amount Cameron would save is 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final answer is: $250"
"To find out how much hay Nate needs, we first need to determine the amount each sheep needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Twice the amount each goat needs: 2 * 5 = 10 pounds
3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs: 10 - 3 = 7 pounds

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately:

For the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds
For the sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

To find the total amount of hay Nate needs, we add the amount needed for the goats and the sheep:

Total hay needed = 75 pounds (goats) + 84 pounds (sheep) = 159 pounds

The final answer is: 159"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate John's total earnings for the week. 

John's hourly wage is 50 dollars, and he worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.

Next, we need to subtract the cost of gas and the cost of pencils from his total earnings. The cost of gas is 50 dollars, and the cost of 5 pencils is 5 * 10 = 50 dollars. 

So, the total amount spent is 50 + 50 = 100 dollars. 

Now, we subtract this amount from John's total earnings: 300 - 100 = 200 dollars.

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he will have 200 - 100 = 100 dollars left.

Now, we need to find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with the remaining 100 dollars. 

To do this, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of a pen: 100 / 25 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total number of letters in the words Craig spelled, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word: 20 * 15 = 300.

Since Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, we add 50 to the total number of letters Craig spelled: 300 + 50 = 350.

Now, we need to find the number of words Craig's brother spelled. Since they took turns, Craig and his brother each spelled 20 words, so Craig's brother also spelled 20 words.

We know the number of letters in each word Craig's brother spelled is the same as Craig's, which is 15. To find the total number of letters in the words Craig's brother spelled, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word: 20 * 15 = 300.

Now, we add the total number of letters in the words Craig spelled and the words Craig's brother spelled: 300 + 300 = 600.

The final answer is: 600"
"To find the total number of children in the drill, we need to multiply the number of children in each row by the number of rows and then multiply the result by the number of schools.

Number of children in each row: 8
Number of rows: 7
Number of schools: 5

First, multiply the number of children in each row by the number of rows: 8 * 7 = 56
Then, multiply the result by the number of schools: 56 * 5 = 280

The total number of children in the drill is 280."
"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we first need to determine the total number of bottles she has initially and then subtract the number of bottles given to the students.

The teacher has 9 coupons, each redeemable for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles she has initially is 9 * 100 = 900 bottles.

Each of the 29 students gets 2 bottles of apple juice, so the total number of bottles given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58 bottles.

To find out how many bottles the teacher has left, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles she initially had: 900 - 58 = 842.

The final answer is: 842"
"To find the total amount Patty charged, we need to calculate the labor cost and add it to the cost of parts and the initial visit fee.

The labor cost is $35 per hour, and the job took 2.25 hours. Since the labor is charged per hour or part thereof, we need to round up to the nearest hour for the labor cost. However, in this case, 2.25 hours is less than 3 hours, so we can simply multiply 2.25 hours by $35 per hour.

Labor cost = 2.25 hours * $35 per hour = $78.75

The cost of parts is $60.

The initial visit fee is $40.

Total cost = Labor cost + Cost of parts + Initial visit fee
Total cost = $78.75 + $60 + $40
Total cost = $178.75

The final answer is: $178.75"
"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we first need to calculate the original price of the CDs and then subtract the discount. 

The original price of 10 CDs is 10 * $15 = $150. 

Since James gets a 40% discount, we need to find 40% of $150. 
40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price: $150 - $60 = $90.

James spent $90 on the CDs.

Next, we need to find out how much he got back from selling 5 CDs. 
He sold each CD for $40, so he got 5 * $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he got back from the amount he spent: $90 - $200 = -$110.

However, since James can't be out a negative amount of money, this means he actually lost money. He spent more than he got back. 

The final answer is: -$110"
"To find out how much Jen will earn, we need to calculate the total revenue from each type of root crop and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the yams: 6 yams * $1.5 = $9

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the sweet potatoes: 10 sweet potatoes * $2 = $20

Now, let's calculate the revenue from the carrots: 4 carrots * $1.25 = $5

Finally, let's add the revenues together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the time it took James to swim 60% of the distance. The distance is 20 miles, and 60% of that is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time it took him to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

Next, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, let's find the remaining distance. The total distance is 20 miles, and James has already swum 12 miles, so the remaining distance is 20 - 12 = 8 miles. James swims the remaining distance at half his original speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. The time it takes him to swim the remaining 8 miles is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

The total time it took James to get across the lake is the sum of the swimming time, the resting time, and the time it took him to swim the remaining distance: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday and then subtract 40 from that result.

First, we find seven times the number of loaves Sam had: 7 * 70 = 490.

Then, we subtract 40 from that result: 490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

450"
"To find out how many stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to calculate the total number of stickers she has after receiving and losing some.

First, Jasmine was given 15 stickers for participating in class. 
Then, she lost 7 stickers during playtime, so we subtract 7 from 15: 15 - 7 = 8 stickers.
After that, her teacher gave her 5 more stickers for helping her classmates. 
Now, we add 5 to 8: 8 + 5 = 13 stickers.

So, Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.

13"
"To find the total commission earned by Cayley, we need to calculate the commission from the sales of the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the commission from the New York Times sales:

- Number of copies sold: 6
- Price per copy: $5
- Commission rate: 10%
- Commission per copy: 10% of $5 = 0.1 * $5 = $0.5
- Total commission from New York Times: 6 * $0.5 = $3

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal sales:

- Number of copies sold: 10
- Price per copy: $15
- Commission rate: 8%
- Commission per copy: 8% of $15 = 0.08 * $15 = $1.2
- Total commission from Wall Street Journal: 10 * $1.2 = $12

Now, let's add the total commission from both newspapers to find the overall commission earned by Cayley:

Total commission = $3 + $12 = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Deanna is 26 years old. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old.

Since Marcus is half of Leo's age, we can set up an equation to find Leo's age: 

Let L be Leo's age. 
Marcus is half of Leo's age, so Marcus = L/2. 
We know Marcus is 21, so L/2 = 21. 
To find L, we multiply both sides by 2: L = 21 * 2. 

L = 42.

The final answer is: 42"
"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Bahati and Dinar. 

Let's denote the points scored by Dinar as 'x'. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati's points can be represented as 'x + 10'. 

We also know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Azibo's points can be represented as '(x + 10) - 20' or 'x - 10'.

The total points scored by the team is 45, which is the sum of the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar. We can write this as an equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x - 10) = 45

Combine like terms:

3x = 45

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 15

Now that we know Dinar scored 15 points, we can find Azibo's points by subtracting 10 from Bahati's points. However, we first need to find Bahati's points. Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, and we know Dinar scored 15 points, we can represent Bahati's points as '15 + 20' or '35'. 

Azibo's points can be found by subtracting 20 from Bahati's points: 35 - 20 = 15.

However, we know that Azibo's points can also be represented as 'x - 10'. Since we found that x = 15, we can confirm that Azibo's points are indeed 15 - 10 = 5.

The points scored by Azibo is 5."
"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book in inches.

Since each paper is 100 pages to the inch and each paper is printed on both sides, we have 200 pages per inch (100 pages per side).

Given that the book is 1.5 inches thick, we can multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book:

200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 300 pages

The final answer is: 300"
"To find out how many reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he worked and then multiply it by the number of reports he staples per minute.

First, let's find the total number of minutes he worked. He worked from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. 

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so the total number of minutes he worked is 15 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 900 minutes.

Now, we know that Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many reports he staples per minute, we divide 30 by 15, which equals 2 reports per minute.

Now, we multiply the total number of minutes he worked (900) by the number of reports he staples per minute (2). 

900 minutes * 2 reports per minute = 1800 reports.

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. This is a total of 8 hours, which is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m. This means she slept for 5:55 a.m. - 10 p.m. = 7 hours and 55 minutes, which is 7 * 60 + 55 = 455 minutes.

She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

To find the total sleep time, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking from the total sleep time: 455 - 23 = 432 minutes.

The final answer is: 432"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons.

Two dozen cups is equal to 2 x 12 = 24 cups.

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we can multiply the number of cups by 2/3 to find the number of measuring spoons.

Number of measuring spoons = 24 x (2/3) = 16

Now, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we subtract the number of spoons he gave away from the initial number of spoons.

Remaining spoons = 16 - 6 = 10

Since Jonathan has 24 cups and 10 spoons, the total number of utensils he has remaining is 24 + 10 = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we first need to find the number of occupied beds and then subtract it from the total capacity.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied. 

1/5 of 1000 is 100. So, the number of occupied beds is 100.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we need to find the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 14 days.

The total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks is 50 * 14 = 700.

Now, we add the initial occupied beds and the beds occupied in 2 weeks: 100 + 700 = 800.

The number of unoccupied beds is the total capacity minus the occupied beds: 1000 - 800 = 200.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we first need to determine the number of non-work emails she sends. 

She sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to her family. Two-thirds of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6. This means she sends 6 emails to her family.

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after sending to her family. Since she sends 6 emails to her family, the remaining emails are 9 - 6 = 3.

One-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend. One-third of 3 is (1/3) * 3 = 1.

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

We know that Aliya is 3 years old. We also know that Shawna is three times as old as Aliya. 

So, Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age = 3 * 3 = 9 years.

We also know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. 

So, Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age = 5 * 9 = 45 years.

"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from the number she reported.

Let's assume the number Courtney reported is 100%. Since she overstated the number by 20%, the actual number is 80% of the number she reported.

Let x be the actual number of people who attended the concert. We can set up the equation:

x = 0.8 * 48

To find x, we multiply 0.8 by 48.

x = 0.8 * 48
x = 38.4

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is: 38.4"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that Jason carried 2 balls, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. This means Jeffrey carried half the number of balls Jason carried, which is 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them: 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

However, this is the number of balls the boys carried, not the total number of balls the coach brought to practice. Since the boys carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is equal to the number of balls the boys carried.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of holes dug on the first day as H1 = 10, the second day as H2 = 13, and the third day as H3 = 8. However, we need to subtract the 2 holes filled in, so the actual number of holes at the end of the third day is H3 - 2 = 6.

The total number of holes at the end of the third day is the sum of the holes dug on the first three days minus the 2 holes filled in: H1 + H2 + (H3 - 2) = 10 + 13 + 6 = 29.

The problem states that the island had four times as many holes by the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. This means the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * H1 = 4 * 10 = 40.

Since we know the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 40, and we know the number of holes at the end of the third day is 29, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 40 - 29 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and the third person, Collins, got 15 more than each of them. 

Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips each person got. So, the total number of corn chips is 70 + 70 + 85 = 225.

The total number of corn chips is 225."
"To find the total cost of travel, we first need to determine the cost of the supplies, which is given as $400. 

Since the tickets for travel cost 50% more than the supplies, we need to calculate 50% of $400 and add it to the cost of the supplies.

50% of $400 is calculated as 0.5 * $400 = $200.

Now, we add this to the cost of the supplies: $400 + $200 = $600.

So, the total cost of travel is $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe have caught a total of 339 PokÃ©mon.
2. Alex has caught 5 more PokÃ©mon than Stan.
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught.

Let's denote the number of PokÃ©mon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as L.

From point 3, we can write an equation: S = 4A - 13.

From point 2, we can write another equation: L = S + 5.

We also know that the total number of PokÃ©mon caught is 339, so we can write the equation: A + S + L = 339.

Now, we can substitute the expression for S from the first equation into the second equation: L = (4A - 13) + 5, which simplifies to L = 4A - 8.

Now we can substitute the expressions for S and L into the total equation: A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339.

Combine like terms: 9A - 21 = 339.

Add 21 to both sides: 9A = 360.

Divide by 9: A = 40.

Now that we know A, we can find S: S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147.

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and then add it to the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the southerly direction for the first 10 hours:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours
Distance = 300 miles

Then, the bird flies towards the north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 36 miles

Since the bird is flying north, this distance is subtracted from the total southerly distance:
Total southerly distance = 300 miles - 36 miles
Total southerly distance = 264 miles

Finally, the bird flies towards the south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 110 miles

To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we add the total southerly distance and the distance traveled in the final southerly direction:
Total distance = Total southerly distance + Distance in the final southerly direction
Total distance = 264 miles + 110 miles
Total distance = 374 miles

"To find the total number of brownies Greta had left over, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and then subtract the number of brownies eaten.

Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself, which is 12 brownies. 

At her office, they sent her home with 1/2 a dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies. 

Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting at home, which is 48 brownies.

So, the total number of brownies Greta received is 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

To find the number of brownies Greta had left over, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies she received: 66 - 18 = 48.

"To find the total age of all three family members, we first need to determine the age of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means her age is 75% of Nani's age. To find 75% of Nani's age, we multiply his age by 0.75: 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we add up the ages of all three family members: Nani's age (8 years) + his brother's age (16 years) + his sister's age (6 years) = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

The total age of all three family members is 30 years."
"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time it takes for each type of stringing and then add them together.

For synthetic gut, it takes 15 minutes per racquet, and there are 3 racquets. So, the total time for synthetic gut is 3 * 15 = 45 minutes.

For polyester string, it takes 22 minutes per racquet, and there are 5 racquets. So, the total time for polyester string is 5 * 22 = 110 minutes.

For hybrid sets, it takes 18 minutes per racquet, and there are 4 racquets. So, the total time for hybrid sets is 4 * 18 = 72 minutes.

Now, we add the total time for each type of stringing together: 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes.

The final answer is: 227"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first two phones and the remaining phones. 

The first two phones cost the full price of $600 each, so the total cost for the first two phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.

The remaining phones are 2 (for the kids and his wife), and each of these phones is half the price of the first two, which is $600 / 2 = $300.

The total cost for the remaining phones is 2 * $300 = $600.

Now, we add the cost of the first two phones and the remaining phones to get the total cost: $1200 + $600 = $1800.

"To find the total number of players in both teams, we first need to determine the number of players in Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players in Zeke's team by adding 7 to 13.

Zeke's team = Carlton's team + 7
Zeke's team = 13 + 7
Zeke's team = 20

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams, we add the number of players in Zeke's team to the number of players in Carlton's team.

Total players = Zeke's team + Carlton's team

Given that the length (l) is 15 feet and the width (w) is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(15 + 10)
P = 2(25)
P = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

Total slats needed = 50 * 2

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we first need to determine how many boxes she had left after giving some to her mom and sister. 

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each, so she gave away a total of 2 + 2 = 4 boxes. 

Now, we subtract the boxes she gave away from the total number of boxes she bought: 12 - 4 = 8 boxes.

Each box contains 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges in 8 boxes is 8 * 20 = 160 oranges.

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 160 = 40 oranges. 

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges: 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total number of states in both countries, we first need to determine the number of states in each country. 

The USA has 50 states. 

Half of 50 is 25. 

India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, so India has 25 + 4 = 29 states.

Now, we add the number of states in the USA and India together: 50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79.

The total number of states in both countries together is 79."
"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books. 

The total cost of the books is the sum of the cost of the dictionary, the dinosaur book, and the children's cookbook. 

Total cost = $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, we need to subtract this from the total cost to find out how much more he needs to earn.

Amount needed to earn = Total cost - Amount saved = $39 - $14 = $25

Now, we can find out how many hours Tyler needs to work by dividing the amount he needs to earn by his hourly wage.

Hours needed to work = Amount needed to earn / Hourly wage = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

So, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more than Richard. This means Richard has 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.

Since the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert and Richard have 30 and 20 cherries respectively, Jerry must have 60 - (30 + 20) = 10 cherries.

Now, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. Robert has 30 cherries, and Jerry has 10 cherries. So, Robert has 30 - 10 = 20 more cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the information given. 

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. 
On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.

On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. 
On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. 
So, on Saturday, he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each day. 
On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread at $6 each, so he earned 10 * 6 = $60 from gingerbread. 
He also sold 11 boxes of apple pie at $15 each, so he earned 11 * 15 = $165 from apple pie. 
Total earnings on Saturday = $60 + $165 = $225.

On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of gingerbread at $6 each, so he earned 15 * 6 = $90 from gingerbread. 
He also sold 15 boxes of apple pie at $15 each, so he earned 15 * 15 = $225 from apple pie. 
Total earnings on Sunday = $90 + $225 = $315.

Total earnings for two days = $225 + $315 = $540.

The final answer is: $540"
"To determine the total number of bottles Pamela will need, we need to calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use and divide it by the amount in each bottle.

Pamela will be outside for 4 hours a day for 8 days, so she will be outside for a total of 4 * 8 = 32 hours.

Since she reapplies sunscreen every hour, she will use 32 ounces of sunscreen in total.

Each bottle contains 8 ounces of sunscreen. To find out how many bottles she will need, we divide the total amount of sunscreen she will use (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces):

32 ounces / 8 ounces per bottle = 4 bottles

So, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen. 

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

First, let's find 40% of the price of the blue car:
40% of $100 = 0.4 * $100 = $40

Now, subtract $40 from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car:
$100 - $40 = $60

So, the price of the red car is $60.

To find the total cost of both cars, we add the prices of the red and blue cars:
$60 + $100 = $160

The final answer is: $160"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Emil is 19 years old now. When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad and twice as old as his brother. 

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B. 

We know that E = 19. 

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = 0.5D. 

We can solve for D: D = 24 / 0.5 = 48.

When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B. 

We can solve for B: B = 24 / 2 = 12.

Now that we have the ages of Emil's dad and brother when Emil turns 24, we need to find their current ages. 

Since Emil is 19 now, his dad's current age is D - (24 - 19) = 48 - 5 = 43.

His brother's current age is B - (24 - 19) = 12 - 5 = 7.

The sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is 43 + 7 = 50.

"To find out how many beads Adrianne has altogether, we need to calculate the number of beads she received from her mother, sister, and friend, and then add them together.

Adrianne's mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day and add them together.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by the serving size: 21 / 3 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the number of students leaving early, we first need to find the number of football players, and then add the number of cheerleaders or band members.

First, let's find the number of football players. 20% of 30 students are football players. 

20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6

So, there are 6 football players.

Now, let's find the number of remaining students. Since 6 students are football players, the remaining students are 30 - 6 = 24.

Out of the remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band.

25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6

So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members.

Now, let's add the number of football players and cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early.

6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we first need to determine Charlie's shoe size. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size five boots, we can calculate Charlie's size as follows:

Charlie's size = 5 * Sophie's size
Charlie's size = 5 * 5
Charlie's size = 25

Now, we can find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie by adding their sizes and dividing by 2:

Average size = (Sophie's size + Charlie's size) / 2
Average size = (5 + 25) / 2
Average size = 30 / 2
Average size = 15

"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to calculate the total space available for plants. Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant, we'll subtract the space taken by the plants and the space between them from the total length of the flower bed.

First, let's convert the length of the flower bed to inches: 111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches.

Now, let's calculate the total space taken by the plants and the space between them. Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (18 inches) between every plant, we'll add the width of the plant (12 inches) and the space between the plants (18 inches) to get the total space taken by each plant: 12 inches + 18 inches = 30 inches.

Now, let's calculate the total space available for plants: 1332 inches - 30 inches (space taken by each plant) = 1302 inches.

Since Pat already owns 17 flowers, we'll subtract the space taken by these plants from the total space available: 1302 inches - (17 * 30 inches) = 1302 - 510 = 792 inches.

Now, let's convert the remaining space back to feet: 792 inches / 12 inches/foot = 66 feet.

Since each plant is 12 inches wide, we can fit 66 feet / 1.5 feet (space between plants) = 44 plants in the remaining space. 

Now, let's add the plants Pat already owns: 44 + 17 = 61 plants.

Since each plant costs $6, Pat will spend 61 * $6 = $366 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day, we need to calculate 1/2 of the number of pretzels Edgar eats in a day. 

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. 
1/2 of 18 is 18 / 2 = 9 pretzels.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to multiply the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day by 7.

9 pretzels/day * 7 days = 63 pretzels

The final answer is: 63"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of petunias: 
5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket = 15 petunias
Cost of 15 petunias = 15 * $3.00 = $45.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of sweet potato vines:
5 baskets * 2 sweet potato vines per basket = 10 sweet potato vines
Cost of 10 sweet potato vines = 10 * $2.50 = $25.00

Now, let's add the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines together:
Total cost = $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

The total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is $70.00."
"To find out how many roses they can plant, we first need to determine how much soil is left after planting the sunflowers and carnations. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers: 4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the carnations: 10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds.

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations: 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds.

Since they started with a 30-pound bag of soil, we subtract the soil used from the total: 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds.

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil, so we can plant 3 roses with the remaining soil.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we first need to calculate how much she saves each month. 

Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets 25% of her paycheck aside for shoes. To find 25% of $2,000.00, we multiply $2,000.00 by 0.25.

$2,000.00 * 0.25 = $500.00

So, Jessica saves $500.00 each month for shoes.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly savings by 12 to find the yearly savings.

$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy with her yearly savings. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp. 

First, let's find out how long it takes her to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, we can divide 90 by 6 to get the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. 

90 / 6 = 15 minutes

Now, let's find out how long it takes her to cook 90 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can divide 90 by 30 to find out how many batches she needs to cook, and then multiply that by 10 to get the total cooking time. 

90 / 30 = 3 batches
3 batches * 10 minutes per batch = 30 minutes

However, since peeling and cooking are done sequentially, we need to add the time it takes to peel and cook. 

15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (cooking) = 45 minutes

So, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

The final answer is: 45"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour on low and 3 degrees per hour on high. The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour without the air conditioner.

2. The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, so it cooled the room by 2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees.

3. Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, so it cooled the room by 3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = 12 degrees.

4. The total cooling effect of the air conditioner is 6 degrees (low) + 12 degrees (high) = 18 degrees.

5. However, the room also warmed up for 2 hours without the air conditioner, so it warmed up by 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees.

6. The net cooling effect of the air conditioner is 18 degrees (cooling) - 4 degrees (warming) = 14 degrees.

7. Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how old Bill's dad was when he saw the comet for the first time and then use that information to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time.

Let's denote the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet as 'x'. Since Bill saw the comet when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, Bill's age at that time is 3x.

We know that the time between two sightings of the comet is 75 years. So, the difference in age between the two sightings is 75 years. 

When Bill saw the comet for the second time, his age was 3x and his dad's age was x. The difference in their ages is 3x - x = 2x. This difference is equal to 75 years.

Now, we can set up the equation: 2x = 75

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 2: x = 75 / 2
x = 37.5

This is the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet for the first time. Now, we need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time. We know that Bill's age at the second sighting was 3x, so we can substitute the value of x into the equation: 3 * 37.5 = 112.5

The final answer is: 112.5"
"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each category and then add them together.

1. Checks for the electric bill: Since Buford writes a check once per month, and there are 12 months in a year, he writes 12 checks for the electric bill per year.
2. Checks for the gas bill: Similarly, since Buford writes a check once per month, he writes 12 checks for the gas bill per year.
3. Checks to the church: Buford writes a check twice per month, so in a year, he writes 2 * 12 = 24 checks to the church.
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: Buford writes a check quarterly, which means 4 times a year. So, he writes 4 checks to the pest and lawn service per year.

Now, let's add up the total number of checks:

12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52

So, Buford writes 52 checks per year.

The final answer is: 52"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as 'x'. Since the second plane makes half the number of trips as the first plane, it makes x/2 trips.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, which is (3/4)x. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is (1/4)x.

We are given that the second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. So, we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 44

To find the total number of flights made by the first plane, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 88

Now that we know the total number of flights made by the first plane, we can find the number of flights to France:

Flights to France = (1/4)x
= (1/4)(88)
= 22

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the individual howling times and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"Let's break down the information given. Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is 2 * $6 = $12. 

So, the total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since Adam bought the trousers for $30, we need to find out how much he had to contribute from his savings. To do this, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the total cost of the trousers: $30 - $18 = $12.

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings.

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the age of Wilfred as 'W'. Since Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, we can express Helene's age as 2 * (average age of the group).

The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children. We know the total age is 20 and there are 4 children. So, the average age of the group is 20 / 4 = 5.

Helene's age is 2 * 5 = 10.

We know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro, which are 3 and 4 respectively. We also know the age of Helene, which is 10. We can express the total age of the group as the sum of their ages: 3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20.

Now, let's solve for W:

3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20
17 + W = 20
W = 20 - 17
W = 3

"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund. 

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Since everyone else (Walter's neighbors and the online fund) donated $2000, Walter's lawyer will donate 3 * $2000 = $6000.

However, the question states that Walter is going to tell his lawyer about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200. This implies that the friend's donation is not included in the amount that Walter's lawyer will base his donation on. Therefore, Walter's lawyer will donate 3 * $2000 = $6000.

"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we first need to find out the total number of cookies. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church. So, the number of cookies given to the church is 1500 * 1/2 = 750.

Now, we know that each person in the church got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church, we need to divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got. 

Number of people in the church = Total cookies given to the church / Number of cookies per person
= 750 / 15

"To solve this problem, let's assume the total number of slices the watermelon is divided into is 'x'. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is 6. 

Let's say each kid gets 'k' slices. Since each adult gets twice as many slices as each kid, each adult gets '2k' slices. 

We know that the total number of slices is 6, so we can set up the equation: 2(2k) + 4k = 6. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 4k + 4k = 6, which is 8k = 6. 

Dividing both sides by 8, we get k = 6/8, which simplifies to k = 3/4.

Since each adult gets 2k slices, each adult gets 2(3/4) = 3/2 slices.

The total number of slices is 6, so the total number of slices is 6. The total number of slices is the sum of the slices each adult and each kid gets. 

The total number of slices the adults get is 2(3/2) = 3. The total number of slices the kids get is 4(3/4) = 3. 

Since the total number of slices is 6, the total number of slices is 6. 

The percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is (3/6) * 100 = 50%.

"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we first need to calculate the total time he spends on rounds and appointments.

Time spent on rounds: 
- Number of inpatients: 9
- Time per inpatient: 20 minutes
- Total time spent on rounds: 9 * 20 = 180 minutes

Time spent on appointments: 
- Number of appointments: 10
- Time per appointment: 30 minutes
- Total time spent on appointments: 10 * 30 = 300 minutes

Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 + 300 = 480 minutes

Since Doctor Jones works for 9 hours at the clinic, we need to convert this to minutes: 
- 9 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 540 minutes

Now, we subtract the total time spent on rounds and appointments from the total time he works: 
- 540 minutes - 480 minutes = 60 minutes

To convert the remaining time back to hours: 
- 60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

So, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records.

"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake. 

First, let's add the time it takes to make the cake batter (20 minutes) and bake the cake (30 minutes): 20 + 30 = 50 minutes.

Next, we add the time it takes to cool the cake (2 hours, which is 120 minutes) and the time it takes to frost the cake (10 minutes): 120 + 10 = 130 minutes. 

Now, we add the time it takes to make the cake batter and bake the cake (50 minutes) to the time it takes to cool and frost the cake (130 minutes): 50 + 130 = 180 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

Now, we add the 3 hours to the time at which Jordan wants to serve the cake (5:00 pm) to find the latest time she can start making the cake: 5:00 pm + 3 hours = 8:00 pm.

The final answer is 8."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to first find the total number of boxes sold by both Lisa and Peter. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so together they sold 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

Since they sold 64 chocolate bars together and they sold 8 boxes, we can divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes to find out how many chocolate bars are in a box.

64 / 8 = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of the students per session, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

The studio is rented 3 days a week, and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month. So, the total number of sessions in a month is 3 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25. The cost of students per session is $1.50 per student, and there are 10 students. So, the total cost of students per session is $1.50 * 10 = $15.

The total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $15 (students) = $40.

To find the total earnings in a month, we multiply the total cost per session by the number of sessions in a month: $40/session * 12 sessions/month = $480.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box for both Peter and Martha, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the gallons of water needed, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. There are 7.48 gallons in a cubic foot, so:

Volume in gallons = 1400 * 7.48
Volume in gallons = 10472 gallons

Now, we multiply the volume in gallons by 5.9 to get the total gallons of water needed:
Total gallons = 10472 * 5.9
Total gallons = 61851.28 gallons

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the total gallons by the cost per gallon:
Cost = 61851.28 * 0.10
Cost = 6185.128

The final answer is: $6185.13"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to determine the number of blue and yellow sticks first. 

We know there are 9 red sticks and 5 more blue sticks than red. So, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how many miles each person traveled, we need to multiply their speed by the time they traveled.

Matteo's distance = speed * time = 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles

Shandy's distance = speed * time = 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, we need to find the difference between the two distances to see how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo.

Difference = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the number of female students, we first need to determine the number of students over 16 and under 16, and then find the number of female students in each group.

Half of the students are over 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500 students.
One-fourth of the students over 16 are male: 1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16.
So, the number of female students over 16 is 1500 - 375 = 1125.

The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500 students.
One-half of the students under 16 are male: 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16.
So, the number of female students under 16 is 1500 - 750 = 750.

Now, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16 to find the total number of female students: 1125 + 750 = 1875.

"To find out how many laps each person can run, we need to calculate their individual lap counts.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we need to subtract Quinn's lap count from Bethany's lap count: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how much water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day. 

Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. 
Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. 
Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water pumped on both days. 
Wanda's total = 4500 + 3000 = 7500 gallons.
Ms. B's total = 3375 + 1125 = 4500 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped is 7500 + 4500 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the remaining amount of water needed to fill the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park is x.

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is 100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%.

In the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining is 55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%.

However, we are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. This means that the 34% charge remaining after 8 hours is reduced to 28% in the last hour. This implies that the power bank loses 34% - 28% = 6% of its capacity in the last hour.

Since the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour for 3 hours, we can set up an equation to find the charge remaining after 8 hours: 34% - (7% * 3) = 34% - 21% = 13%. However, we know that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 28%, so the power bank loses 13% - 28% = -15% in the last hour, which is not possible. This means that the power bank does not lose 7% of its capacity for 3 hours.

Let's re-evaluate the situation. The power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour for 5 hours, and then it loses 7% of its capacity for 3 hours. However, we know that the final charge remaining is 28%. We can set up an equation to find the charge remaining after 5 hours: 100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%.

Now, let's assume that the power bank loses 7% of its capacity for 2 hours instead of 3 hours. In this case, the charge remaining after 7 hours is 55% - (7% * 2) = 55% - 14% = 41%. In the last hour, the power bank loses 41% - 28% = 13% of its capacity. However, we know that the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour for 5 hours, and then it loses 7% of its capacity for 2 hours. We can set up an equation to find the charge remaining after 5 hours: 100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%.

"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings. 

Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, so her total hourly earnings are $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1000.

Next, we need to find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car, so the down payment amount is 20% of $10,000, which is 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000.

Now, we can divide the down payment amount by Janet's weekly earnings to find out how many weeks she needs to work: $2,000 / $1000 = 2.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has spent so far. 

3 peaches at $0.5 each will be 3 * $0.5 = $1.5

2 kiwis at $1 each will be 2 * $1 = $2
5 apples at $0.75 each will be 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Adding these amounts together, Jamaar has spent $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9 so far.

Since Jamaar has $10, he has $10 - $9 = $1 left.

Plums cost $0.25 each, so we can divide the remaining money by the cost of a plum to find out how many plums he can buy: $1 / $0.25 = 4.

"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of her friends received, we first need to determine the total number of packs Anne gave to her friends. Since she kept 2 packs for herself, she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Next, we need to find out how many packs each friend received. Since there are 10 friends, we divide the total number of packs given away (13) by the number of friends (10). 

13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs per friend. 

Since each pack contains 60 pieces, we multiply the number of packs each friend received by the number of pieces in each pack.

1.3 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 78 pieces.

So, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures by 8.

Total pictures = 72
Pictures per album = Total pictures / 8
Pictures per album = 72 / 8
Pictures per album = 9

Now, we know that 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits. Since the number of pictures per album is 9, we can multiply this by the number of albums for each category to find the total number of selfies and portraits.

Selfies = Pictures per album * Number of selfie albums
Selfies = 9 * 3
Selfies = 27

Portraits = Pictures per album * Number of portrait albums
Portraits = 9 * 2
Portraits = 18

The final answer is: 
Selfies: 27
Portraits: 18"
"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to determine how many sets of 3 pages he reads and then multiply that by the time it takes him to read one set of 3 pages.

Since James reads 18 pages, we can divide 18 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 pages he reads: 18 / 3 = 6.

Now, we know it takes James 10 minutes to read one set of 3 pages. Since he reads 6 sets, we multiply 10 minutes by 6: 10 * 6 = 60.

James spends 60 minutes reading his book."
"To find the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to calculate the number of guests who checked in and subtract the number of guests who checked out.

Initially, there were 100 guests. 

24 guests checked out early, so the remaining guests are 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, so the number of guests who have checked out is 24 (early checkouts) + 15 (late checkouts) = 39.

The number of guests who have not checked out is 76 - 39 = 37.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30.

So, the total number of guests who have checked in is 30 (in the afternoon) + 7 (after dinner) = 37.

Now, we add the number of guests who have checked in to the number of guests who have not checked out: 37 (checked in) + 37 (not checked out) = 74.

"To find out how many points Aries is sure to get, we first need to determine the number of questions in each category. 

There are 60 questions in total. 40% of them are easy, so the number of easy questions is 0.4 * 60 = 24. The rest are equally divided between average and difficult questions, so there are 60 - 24 = 36 questions left. This means there are 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 0.75 * 24 = 18 easy questions. She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 0.5 * 18 = 9 average questions and 0.5 * 18 = 9 difficult questions.

To find the total number of points Aries is sure to get, we add the number of easy, average, and difficult questions she is sure to get: 18 + 9 + 9 = 36.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 's' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'l'. We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write an equation:

s = 2l

We also know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total amount earned from the sales is $120. We can write an equation based on the total earnings:

4s + 12l = 120

Substituting s = 2l into the equation, we get:

4(2l) + 12l = 120
8l + 12l = 120
20l = 120

Now, we can solve for l:

l = 120 / 20
l = 6

Since s = 2l, we can find the number of small stuffed animals:

s = 2 * 6

"To find the total number of sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches they eat per day and then multiply it by 7.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, the wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and the son eats 2 sandwiches per day. 

Total sandwiches per day = 5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day.

Now, we multiply the total sandwiches per day by 7 to get the total sandwiches in a week.

Total sandwiches in a week = 11 sandwiches per day * 7 days = 77 sandwiches.

The final answer is: 77"
"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings and then subtract the amount she gave to her sisters.

First, let's calculate her earnings from selling cookies: 80 cookies * $1 each = $80.

Next, let's calculate her earnings from selling cupcakes: 60 cupcakes * $4 each = $240.

Now, let's add her earnings from cookies and cupcakes: $80 + $240 = $320.

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave away a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the amount she gave away from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To find the number of eggs found by the friends, we first need to determine the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins. Since each twin found 30 eggs, the total number of eggs found by the twins is 2 * 30 = 60.

Now, we know that all the eggs except 10 were found by the twins and their friends. This means that the total number of eggs found by the twins and their friends is 100 - 10 = 90.

Since the twins found 60 eggs, the number of eggs found by the friends can be calculated by subtracting the number of eggs found by the twins from the total number of eggs found by the twins and their friends. 

Number of eggs found by friends = Total eggs found by twins and friends - Eggs found by twins
= 90 - 60
= 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then multiply it by 40 dwarves and 30 days.

First, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe. Since he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe as with his bare hands, he can mine 2 * 12 = 24 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe.

Next, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. Since he can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe, he can mine 24 + (24 * 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes. Since one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, 40 dwarves can mine 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds of ore per day.

Finally, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in 30 days with steel pickaxes. Since they can mine 1440 pounds of ore per day, they can mine 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds of ore in 30 days.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for the first two packages. 

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.5 per sandwich. 

The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.5 per sandwich. 

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is consistent across all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is $1.5.

To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches: $1.5 * 8 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we first need to calculate how much he still owes after selling his old bedroom set. 

The cost of the bedroom set is $3000, and he sells his old bedroom for $1000. 

So, the remaining amount he owes is $3000 - $1000 = $2000.

Since he has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we need to calculate 10% of $2000.

10% of $2000 is calculated as 0.1 * $2000 = $200.

Therefore, Tom has to pay $200 per month. 

The final answer is: $200"
"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 40% of 25 is 0.4 x 25 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 6, so she released 6 yellow balloons, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 75% of 8 is 0.75 x 8 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

Now, let's add up the remaining balloons: 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons. 

15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34

The final number of balloons Sally carried into the school is 34."
"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the scenarios where he won't get an extension. 

First, let's consider the scenario where the substitute teacher is present. In this case, there's a 50% chance of the substitute teacher being present, and since the homework won't be collected in this scenario, the probability of having to turn in the homework is 0%.

Next, let's consider the scenario where the normal teacher is present. In this case, there's a 60% chance (100% - 40% extension chance). Within this 60%, there's a 80% chance (100% - 20% chance of getting a personal extension) that Marcus won't get an extension.

Now, we can calculate the overall probability of having to turn in the homework:

Probability of substitute teacher: 50% * 0% = 0%
Probability of normal teacher with no extension: 60% * 80% = 48%

Adding these probabilities together, we get the overall probability of having to turn in the homework: 0% + 48% = 48%

The final answer is: 48%"
"To find out how many tickets each graduate can receive, we first need to determine the total number of available seats for guests. 

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center: 6000
Seats for graduates: 950
Seats for faculty: 300

Total seats taken: 950 + 300 = 1250
Available seats for guests: 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive.

4750 / 950 = 5

So, each graduate can receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up. We also know that he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans. This means that the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is 2 times 75, which is 150.

Now, we are also told that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. This means that the number of small beans he can eat is 3 times the number of medium-sized beans he can eat. Since he can eat 150 medium-sized beans, he can eat 3 * 150 = 450 small beans.

The final answer is: 450"
"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total earnings and total expenses. 

Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so her total hours worked is 6 * 3 = 18 hours. 

Her total earnings are $15 per day for 3 days, which is 15 * 3 = $45.

Her total expenses for parking are $3 per day for 3 days, which is 3 * 3 = $9.

Now, we subtract her total expenses from her total earnings to find her net earnings: 45 - 9 = $36.

To find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her net earnings by her total hours worked: 36 / 18 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of the books is 3 * 16 = 48 dollars.
The cost of the pencils is 3 * 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the books and the pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

So, Ted spent a total of 66 dollars.

The final answer is: $66"
"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to first determine how many soda bottles he will place along the driveway. 

Since the driveway is 24 feet wide and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet, we can divide the width of the driveway by the spacing between the bottles to find the total number of bottles:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since it takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we can multiply the number of bottles by the time it takes to set off each one:

8 bottles * 5 seconds per bottle = 40 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 40 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many packs Uncle Franky can make, we first need to determine the total number of apples he has. Since he ordered two boxes and each box has 40 apples, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of apples per box.

Total apples = 2 boxes * 40 apples/box = 80 apples

Next, we need to find out how many packs he can make with 80 apples. Since each pack has 8 apples, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack.

Number of packs = Total apples / apples per pack = 80 / 8 = 10

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples. 

10"
"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought. 

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 * $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 * $6 = $18.
The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Since Amor starts with $50, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount of money: $50 - $40 = $10.

So, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat. 

The final answer is: $10"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost due to loans and not working while in college. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of loans he took: 
4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money he lost by not working while in college. 
He earned $25,000 per year before college, so in 4 years, he would have earned:
4 years * $25,000/year = $100,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he lost:
$200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000

After graduating, his income tripled to $75,000 per year. To find out how long it would take him to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost, we can divide the total amount of money he lost by his new income:
$300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total area of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the two pieces of fabric. 

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Since Jim needs the fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, we add 2 feet to both the length and the width. 

New length = 6 + 2 = 8 feet
New width = 8 + 2 = 10 feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the new dimensions by 2 to get the total area of fabric needed.

Total length = 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Total width = 10 * 2 = 20 feet

Now, we multiply the total length and total width to get the total area of fabric needed.

Total area = Total length * Total width = 16 * 20 = 320 square feet

The final answer is: 320"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then add them up.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 17 more than that is 85 + 17 = 102. So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 5 more than that is 204 + 5 = 209. So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, let's add up the number of letters delivered each day: 425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

"To find the average loss, we need to calculate the total loss and then divide it by the number of races. 

First, let's calculate the amount Johnny's dad lost and won in each race. 

In the first race, he lost $5. 
In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost, so he won 2 * $5 + $1 = $11. 
In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race, so he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.

Now, let's calculate the total loss. 
Total loss = Loss in the first race + Loss in the third race = $5 + $16.5 = $21.5

Since there were 3 races, we can now calculate the average loss. 
Average loss = Total loss / Number of races = $21.5 / 3 = $7.17

"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we first need to calculate their current heights. 

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet, which is equivalent to 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches). He grew 3 inches over the summer, so his current height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Cole's initial height was 50 inches, and he grew 2 inches over the summer, so his current height is 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

Now, we can find the difference in their heights by subtracting Xavier's height from Cole's height: 52 - 51 = 1 inch.

The final answer is: 1"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the share of the first person as 'x'. 

Since the second person took $80 more than the first, the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Combine like terms: x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920.

Combine like terms again: 4x + 240 = 1920.

Subtract 240 from both sides: 4x = 1680.

Divide both sides by 4: x = 420.

The share of the first person is $420.

The final answer is: $420"
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we first need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks have 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since the painters worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to convert 3/8ths to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days to get the total hours worked: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4 to get the hours worked by each painter: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Expanding the equation:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

Number of balls in the first set = x + 4
= 6 + 4

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation of the car from 2007 to 2010.

The car was bought in 2007 for $20,000. 

First, let's calculate the depreciation for 3 years (2008, 2009, and 2010).

The depreciation rate is 21% per year. 

For the first year (2008), the depreciation is 21% of $20,000, which is 0.21 * $20,000 = $4,200. 
The price of the car in 2008 is $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800.

For the second year (2009), the depreciation is 21% of $15,800, which is 0.21 * $15,800 = $3,318.
The price of the car in 2009 is $15,800 - $3,318 = $12,482.

For the third year (2010), the depreciation is 21% of $12,482, which is 0.21 * $12,482 = $2,623.22.
The price of the car in 2010 is $12,482 - $2,623.22 = $9,858.78.

The price of the car in 2010 is $9,858.78.

"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to determine the total number of books that are not written in English. 

Since half of the books are written in English, that's 50 / 2 = 25 books in English.

We are also given that 10% of the books are written in German. To find the number of German books, we need to calculate 10% of 50, which is 0.1 * 50 = 5 books in German.

Now, to find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books. 

Number of Spanish books = Total number of books - (Number of English books + Number of German books)

"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we first need to calculate how many cups of water she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. To find out how many cups she drinks in 30 days, we multiply the number of cups she drinks per day by 30.

8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups

Now, we need to convert the total number of cups to gallons. There are 16 cups in a gallon. To find out how many gallons, we divide the total number of cups by 16.

240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

Initially, there are 120 people on the train.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the total number of people becomes:
120 + 20 = 140

At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (100) board the train. So, the total number of people becomes:
140 - 50 + 100 = 190

At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the total number of people becomes:
190 - 80 = 110

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"To find the total amount Alison spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

1. The tank top costs $10.
2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48, but they were on sale for half price. Half of $48 is $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The athletic socks cost $8, and she had a coupon for $2 off, so the socks cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:

"To find the total cost of renovating your kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and then multiply it by the cost of each tile.

First, let's find the area of a single tile. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1 ft, the area of a single tile is 1 ft * 1 ft = 1 SqFt.

Now, to find the total number of tiles required, we divide the total area of the kitchen floor by the area of a single tile: 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt = 200 tiles.

The cost of renovating your kitchen floor will be the total number of tiles multiplied by the cost of each tile: 200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"To find the increased cost of the insurance, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

60% of $120 is 0.6 x $120 = $72. 

The increased cost is $120 + $72 = $192 per month.

"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a week, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he puts on the beds and then divide that by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. Since a twin bed has 1 set of sheets and a king size bed has 1 set of sheets, the total number of sheets he puts on the beds is 4 + 1 = 5.

Since he can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 1, which is 2. This means he can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time.

However, since he has 5 sets of sheets to wash, he will need to do 3 loads of laundry: 2 loads of twin sets (4 twin sets) and 1 load of a king set (1 king set).

To find out how many loads of laundry he does in a year, we need to multiply the number of loads he does in a week by the number of weeks in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year.

So, the total number of loads of laundry he does in a year is 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year.

"To find out how many stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to calculate the total number of stickers he collected over the past three years.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. 
Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.
This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.
So, this year he has 150 + 100 = 250 stickers.

Now, let's add up the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection: 100 (two years ago) + 50 (last year) + 250 (this year) = 400 stickers.

"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount of cat food each cat eats per day (60 grams).

First, we need to calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's 3 cats eat per day. Since each cat eats 60 grams of food twice a day, we multiply 60 grams by 2 to get the daily consumption per cat, which is 120 grams. Then, we multiply this by the number of cats, which is 3.

Daily consumption per cat: 60 grams * 2 = 120 grams
Total daily consumption for 3 cats: 120 grams * 3 = 360 grams

Now, we divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the total daily consumption (360 grams) to find out how many days it will last.

720 grams / 360 grams = 2

So, the cat food will last for 2 days.

We know that Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake did, Jake must have eaten 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

We also know that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake did. Since Jake ate 7 slices, Silvia must have eaten 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

To find the total number of slices eaten, we need to add up the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia. 

Total slices eaten = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices eaten = 10 + 7 + 14
Total slices eaten = 31

Total slices eaten = 31"
"Let's denote the time Donovan took as 'x'. Since Betsy took 18 minutes longer than Donovan, the time Betsy took is 'x + 18'. 

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of the time taken by both Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. So, we can write the equation as x + (x + 18) = 98.

Combine like terms: 2x + 18 = 98.

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

Since x is the time Donovan took, and Betsy took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's time is x + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58.

The final answer is: 58"
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of the cast, the visit, the painkillers, and the parking.

The cost of the cast is $200.

The cost of the visit is $300/hour for 0.5 hours (30 minutes). So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.

The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill for 30 pills. So, the cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

The cost of parking is $6/hour for 2 hours. So, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up the costs: $200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"To find out how many emails James responds to, we first need to find out how many emails he doesn't respond to. 

20% of 80 emails is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails. 

Since James doesn't respond to these 16 emails, he responds to the rest. The rest of the emails are 80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Now, we need to find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week. Since he responds to 64 emails per day, in 5 days he responds to 64 * 5 = 320 emails.

The final answer is: 320"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we need to calculate the number of classes that visited each day and then add them up.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the number of classes that visited each day:
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 207

The final answer is: 207"
"To find the average score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the number of tests. 

First, let's add up the scores of the first 3 tests: 100 + 100 + 100 = 300. 

Then, we add the score of the 4th test: 300 + 80 = 380.

Now, we divide the total score by the number of tests: 380 / 4 = 95.

The final answer is: 95"
"To find the total number of pizzas left, we first need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 
70% of 20 is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 
They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

The total number of pizzas eaten is 14 (by the glee club) + 32 (by the football team) = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered is 20 (by the glee club) + 40 (by the football team) = 60 pizzas.

The number of pizzas left is the total number of pizzas ordered minus the total number of pizzas eaten, which is 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total cost of postage, we first need to determine the number of small and big coupons Anthony is sending out. 

He wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons, so the number of big coupons is 2 * 700 = 1400.

The total number of coupons is 700 (small) + 1400 (big) = 2000.

The cost of mailing small coupons is 2000 * 0.05 = $10.
The cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 0.15 = $210.

The total cost of postage is $10 + $210 = $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"To find out how many meatballs were in the sub sandwiches that remained, we first need to determine how many meatballs Sidney initially ordered. 

Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, so Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches. 

Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, so Sidney initially had 7 * 4 = 28 meatballs.

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, which means he ate 4 * 4 = 16 meatballs.

After Mark ate 4 sub sandwiches, Sidney had 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches left. 

Sidney then ordered 3 more sub sandwiches, so he had a total of 3 + 3 = 6 sub sandwiches left.

The total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we first need to determine the number of trucks that did not experience mechanical failures. 

Since a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, we can calculate the number of trucks that failed as follows:

Number of trucks dispatched = 20
Number of trucks that failed = 20 * (1/4) = 5

Now, we subtract the number of trucks that failed from the total number of trucks dispatched to find the number of trucks that reached the farmers:

Number of trucks that reached the farmers = 20 - 5 = 15

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we multiply the number of trucks that reached the farmers by the tons of fertiliser each truck carried:

Total tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers = 15 * 20 = 300

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total cost of the butter, we first need to determine how much Dennis needs to buy. Since he needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

Since the grocery store has a promotion for buy one pound of butter get one half off, we can calculate the cost of 6 pounds of butter as follows:

- For the first 3 pounds, Dennis will pay full price: 3 pounds * $4.00/pound = $12.00
- For the next 3 pounds, Dennis will get one half off: 3 pounds * $2.00/pound (half of $4.00) = $6.00

The total cost of 6 pounds of butter will be $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00

The final answer is: $18.00"
"To find the total cost of the party, we first need to determine the total number of guests. Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 dance class girls, and 13 family members, but 4 people said they couldn't come. 

Total invited guests = 25 (classmates) + 7 (dance class) + 13 (family members) = 45
Guests who can attend = Total invited guests - Guests who can't come = 45 - 4 = 41

Since the initial fee is for 20 guests, we need to find the number of additional guests. 
Additional guests = Guests who can attend - Initial 20 guests = 41 - 20 = 21

Now, we can calculate the total cost by adding the initial fee and the cost for the additional guests. 
Total cost = Initial fee + (Additional guests * Cost per additional guest)
Total cost = $125 + (21 * $6)
Total cost = $125 + $126
Total cost = $251

The final answer is: $251"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has 3/4 of her money left. Since she had $60, we can set up the equation:

3/4 * x = 60

To find the total amount of money Maggie had, we can multiply both sides by 4/3:

x = 60 * (4/3)
x = 80

So Maggie had $80 initially.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she has 2/3 of her money left. Since she also had $60, we can set up the equation:

2/3 * y = 60

To find the total amount of money Riza had, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

y = 60 * (3/2)
y = 90

So Riza had $90 initially.

Now, let's find the total amount of money they had initially:

Maggie's initial money: $80
Riza's initial money: $90
Total initial money: $80 + $90 = $170

Since they spent a portion of their money, we need to find the total amount they spent. Maggie spent 1/4 of her money, which is $20, and Riza spent 1/3 of her money, which is $30. The total amount they spent is:

$20 + $30 = $50

Now, let's subtract the total amount they spent from the total initial money to find the amount they have left:

Total initial money: $170
Total spent: $50
Money left: $170 - $50 = $120

The final answer is: $120"
"Let's break down the information given. 

First, we know that Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas for his three monkeys for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the daily consumption of bananas for all three monkeys. 

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day. 

Let's denote the number of bananas the third monkey eats as x. Since the total number of bananas for the week is 315, we can set up the equation: 

10 * 7 + 14 * 7 + x * 7 = 315

Combine like terms: 
70 + 98 + 7x = 315

Combine the constants: 
168 + 7x = 315

Subtract 168 from both sides: 
7x = 147

Divide both sides by 7: 
x = 21

The third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

"To find out how many puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to determine how many pieces he placed in total and then subtract the pieces he placed before the hour. 

Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which is 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. 

Then, he finished another 500 piece puzzle. 

So, in total, he placed 250 + 500 = 750 pieces. 

Since he already placed 250 pieces before the hour, we subtract those from the total to find out how many pieces he placed during the hour: 750 - 250 = 500.

The final answer is: 500"
"To find out how much Jenny paid for the roses, we need to determine if she bought the roses by the dozen or individually. Since she bought 15 roses, it's more cost-effective for her to buy a dozen (12 roses) and 3 individual roses.

The cost of a dozen roses is $15. The cost of 3 individual roses is 3 * $2 = $6. So, the total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25. To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she paid with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

Jenny leaves with 16 quarters."
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the revenue from each item and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the revenue from milkshakes: 
6 milkshakes * $5.50 each = 6 * 5.50 = $33

Next, let's calculate the revenue from burger platters: 
9 burger platters * $11 each = 9 * 11 = $99

Now, let's calculate the revenue from sodas: 
20 sodas * $1.50 each = 20 * 1.50 = $30

Finally, let's add the revenue from all items together: 
$33 + $99 + $30 = $162

"To find out how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time intervals between the trains and the time Paul has to wait for his train.

The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station after 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after the first train's arrival. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station after 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes after the first train's arrival. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes after the first train's arrival. Since Paul is at the station when the first train arrives, he will wait for 145 minutes for his train.

The first train arrives in 10 minutes, so Paul will wait for 145 - 10 = 135 minutes.

The final answer is: 135"
"To find out how many more weeks Melanie needs to save toothpicks, we first need to determine how many toothpicks she has saved so far. 

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week and has been doing so for 12 weeks. 

Number of toothpicks saved so far = 10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks.

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks in total, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs to save. 

Number of toothpicks needed = 200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Melanie to save 80 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week.

Number of weeks needed = 80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we first need to find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price, so the price he paid is 75% of $2000, which is 0.75 * $2000 = $1500.

Then, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is 1.2 * $1500 = $1800.

To find the discount percentage, we need to find the difference between the original price and the price at which Mr. Rogers' friend bought the watch, and then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100.

The discount percentage is (($2000 - $1800) / $2000) * 100 = (200 / 2000) * 100 = 10%.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours and then multiply it by the rate at which the springs create jellyfish.

There are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute. So, the total number of seconds in 4 hours is:

60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since each spring creates a new jellyfish every second, the total number of jellyfish created by one spring in 14400 seconds is 14400.

Now, if we have 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created in 14400 seconds is:

14400 * 5 = 72000

So, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

The final answer is: 72000"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score. Binkie's score is 90, so twice that would be 2 * 90 = 180.

Since Frankie's score is 15 better than twice Binkie's, we need to add 15 to the result. So, Frankie's score is 180 + 15 = 195.

The final answer is: 195"
"To find the total distance James walked, we need to calculate the round trip distance. Since he walked halfway to the store and then back home, the total distance is 2 * 4 miles = 8 miles.

Since James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula time = distance / speed to find the total time taken. 

time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours

However, this is the total time taken for the round trip. We need to find the time taken to reach the store initially. Since James walked halfway to the store and then back home, the time taken to reach the store initially is half of the total time.

Time taken to reach the store initially = 2 hours / 2 = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we first need to calculate the total cost of buying the bananas individually and then compare it to the cost of buying them in bunches.

If Jenny buys 10 bunches with 4 bananas per bunch, she buys a total of 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

The cost of buying 10 bunches is $3.00 per bunch, so the total cost is 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

So, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much fence each person gets. Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet of fence.

We know that the total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we need to determine its growth rate per year. 

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. To find the growth rate per year, we divide the total growth by the number of years: 8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year.

Now, we multiply the growth rate per year by the number of years to find the total growth: 2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles, we need to calculate the total number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold. We know that half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes, so the number of Trekking bikes sold is 300 / 2 = 150.

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold. We know that 15% of the 300 bikes sold were BMX bikes, so the number of BMX bikes sold is 300 * 0.15 = 45.

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold. We know that the rest of the bikes sold were MTB type, so the number of MTB bikes sold is 300 - 150 - 45 = 105.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:

- Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250 (since BMX is half the price of an MTB, which is $500, so BMX is $500 / 2 = $250)
- MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add up the total earnings from each type of bike to find the total earnings: $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250.

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck, then subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour and works for 6 hours, so the total number of bales made is 5 * 6 = 30.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour and works for 6 hours, so the total number of bales picked up is 3 * 6 = 18.

Now, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made: 30 - 18 = 12.

So, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total time John spends learning, we need to calculate the time spent in classes, and the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday.

First, let's calculate the time spent in classes. John takes 2 extra classes, each 40 minutes long, 5 days a week. So, the total time spent in classes per week is:
2 classes * 40 minutes/class * 5 days/week = 400 minutes/week

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time spent in classes to hours:
400 minutes/week / 60 minutes/hour = 6.67 hours/week

Next, let's calculate the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday. John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time. There are 7 days in a week, so the total minutes in a week is:
7 days/week * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 1680 minutes/week

John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time:
(1/16) * 1680 minutes/week = 105 minutes/week

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the extra time to hours:
105 minutes/week / 60 minutes/hour = 1.75 hours/week

Now, let's add the time spent in classes and the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday to find the total time spent learning:
6.67 hours/week + 1.75 hours/week = 8.42 hours/week

The final answer is: 8.42"
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to first find the initial height from which it is dropped. Since the third floor is 24 feet high, the initial height is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

The ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height with each bounce. So, on the first bounce, it will reach a height of 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, it will reach a height of 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child in inches. 

The first child is 6 feet tall, which is 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to determine the number of bags sold and then multiply that by the price per bag.

Since the orchard sold a total of 2000 apples and each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag to find the number of bags sold.

Number of bags sold = Total apples / Apples per bag
= 2000 / 10
= 200

Now, we can multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Number of bags sold * Price per bag
= 200 * $5
= $1000

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

First, the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. Before that, the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left. So, the velociraptors ate half of (x - 270), where x is the total weight of the triceratops before the T-Rex ate. 

This can be written as: (x - 270) / 2.

The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, which is x / 2.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, and the velociraptors ate half of what was left, the total weight of the triceratops before the T-Rex ate is equal to the weight eaten by the T-Rex plus the weight eaten by the velociraptors.

So, we can set up the equation: x = (x / 2) + ((x - 270) / 2).

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fractions: 2x = x + (x - 270).

Combine like terms: 2x = 2x - 270.

Subtract 2x from both sides: 0 = -270.

This equation doesn't make sense, as we can't have a negative number of kilograms. Let's re-examine the problem.

The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, and the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left. So, the velociraptors ate half of (x - 270), where x is the total weight of the triceratops before the T-Rex ate.

This can be written as: (x - 270) / 2.

The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, which is x / 2.

The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, so the weight eaten by the velociraptors plus the weight eaten by the T-Rex is equal to the total weight of the triceratops minus 270.

So, we can set up the equation: (x - 270) / 2 + x / 2 = x - 270.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fractions: x - 270 + x = 2x - 540.

Combine like terms: 2x - 270 = 2x - 540.

So, we can set up the equation: (x - 270) / 2 + x / 2 = x - 270.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fractions: x - 270 + x = 2x - 540.

Subtract 2x from both sides: -270 = -540.

This equation still doesn't make sense. Let's re-examine the problem again.

The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, and the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left. So, the velociraptors ate half of (x - 270), where x is the total weight of the triceratops before the T-Rex ate.

This can be written as: (x - 270) / 2.

The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, which is x / 2.

The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, so the weight eaten by the velociraptors plus the weight eaten by the T-Rex is equal to the total weight of the triceratops minus the weight eaten by the Allosaurus.

So, we can set up the equation: (x - 270) / 2 + x / 2 = x - 270.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fractions: x - 270 + x = 2x - 540.

"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted and then divide it by the coverage of a gallon of paint to find out how many gallons are needed. After that, we can multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon to get the total cost.

First, let's calculate the area of each wall:
- North and south walls: 10 x 8 = 80 square feet each
- East and west walls: 5 x 8 = 40 square feet each

The total area of the four walls is: 2 x 80 + 2 x 40 = 160 + 80 = 240 square feet

Since a gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, we need to divide the total area by the coverage of a gallon:
240 / 20 = 12 gallons

Now, we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon:
12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144

The total cost to paint the room is $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to determine the probability of her choosing a shaken can out of the remaining cans.

Initially, there were 12 sodas in total. Ellen shook 3 of them, so there are 3 shaken sodas and 9 unshaken sodas. Ellen took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.

Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas.

Now, there are 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas. The total number of sodas is 8.

The probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans: 2/8 = 0.25.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we add the distances they've traveled to find the total distance between them: 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find out how many people Billy can help, we first need to determine the total number of days he works. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days (since April 19th is the last day he works). So, the total number of days in this period is 31 + 19 = 50 days.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. To do this, we multiply 50 by 0.2 (which is the decimal form of 20%). 

20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 days off.

Now, we subtract the number of days off from the total number of days to find the number of days he works: 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so we need to find out how many hours he works in a day. 

3 hours/day * 40 days = 120 hours.

Now, we multiply the number of hours he works by the number of people he can help per hour: 

120 hours * 2 people/hour = 240 people.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of people inside the church, we first need to calculate the total number of people that were transported by the buses and the cars. 

The number of people transported by the buses is the number of buses multiplied by the number of people each bus can carry: 12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people.

The number of people transported by the cars is the number of cars multiplied by the number of people each car can carry: 20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people.

The total number of people transported is the sum of the people transported by the buses and the cars: 420 people + 60 people = 480 people.

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the total number of people transported from the total number of people present (which is not given). However, we can infer that the total number of people present is the sum of the people transported and the people inside the church. 

Let's denote the number of people inside the church as x. Then, the total number of people present is x + 480. However, the total number of people present is not given, so we cannot find the exact number of people inside the church."
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Mike is 24 years old, and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike. 

So, Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

We also know that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. 

So, Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of each slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: 
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute
Time = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute
Time = 3 minutes

Now, we need to find the difference in time between the two slides:
Difference in time = Time for the biggest slide - Time for the second biggest slide
Difference in time = 5 minutes - 3 minutes
Difference in time = 2 minutes

"To find the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 x 15-minute breaks per day. 
Total time spent per day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 2 x 15 minutes (breaks) = 30 + 30 = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60. 
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunch and breaks. 
Total time spent in 5 days = 1 hour/day x 5 days = 5 hours

The total time spent on lunch and breaks after 5 days is 5 hours."
"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can multiply 8 by 3.5 to find out how many miles Micah ran.

8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now that we know Micah ran 28 miles, we can subtract the total miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles run by all three to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

Total miles run by all three = 52 miles
Miles run by Amber = 8 miles
Miles run by Micah = 28 miles
Miles run by Ahito = Total miles run by all three - (Miles run by Amber + Miles run by Micah)
Miles run by Ahito = 52 - (8 + 28)
Miles run by Ahito = 52 - 36
Miles run by Ahito = 16 miles

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total amount she spent after returning the item and then add that to the initial charge minus the returned item.

First, let's calculate the amount Sheila got back after returning the item:
$85.00 (initial charge) - $15.00 (returned item) = $70.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan:
The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage:
$20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00
Now, subtract the discount from the original price:
$20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

The cost of the frying pan is $16.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the set of towels:
The set of towels was 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage:
$30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00
Now, subtract the discount from the original price:
$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

The cost of the set of towels is $27.00.

Now, let's add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the amount Sheila got back after returning the item:
$70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"Let's break down the information given:

- A fifth of the jellyfish are large.
- A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light.
- The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue.
- When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color.

Since a third of the large jellyfish change color, and 6 jellyfish changed color, we can set up an equation to find the number of large jellyfish. Let L be the number of large jellyfish.

(1/3)L = 6

To find L, we multiply both sides by 3:

L = 6 * 3
L = 18

So, there are 18 large jellyfish. Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, we can set up another equation to find the total number of jellyfish. Let T be the total number of jellyfish.

(1/5)T = 18

To find T, we multiply both sides by 5:

T = 18 * 5
T = 90

Therefore, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find Caroline's age, we need to determine Ben's age first, and then multiply it by 3.

Since Chris is 4 years old, and Ben is two times older than Chris, we can calculate Ben's age as follows:
Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben's age, we can find Caroline's age by multiplying Ben's age by 3:
Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate Lauren's total savings needed for retirement and then determine how many years she needs to work to achieve that goal.

First, let's calculate Lauren's annual expenses in retirement. Since she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, her annual expenses will be 0.4 x $100,000 = $40,000.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount Lauren needs to save for retirement. Assuming she will live for 20 years in retirement, we can use the following formula:

Total Savings = Annual Expenses x Number of Years in Retirement
Total Savings = $40,000 x 20
Total Savings = $800,000

Since Lauren saves 20% of her salary each month, we need to calculate her monthly savings. First, let's convert her annual salary to a monthly salary:

Monthly Salary = $100,000 / 12
Monthly Salary = $8,333.33

Now, let's calculate her monthly savings:

Monthly Savings = 20% of Monthly Salary
Monthly Savings = 0.2 x $8,333.33
Monthly Savings = $1,666.67

Now, we can calculate the number of years Lauren needs to work to save $800,000:

Total Savings / Monthly Savings = Number of Months
$800,000 / $1,666.67 = 480 months

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can convert the number of months to years:

480 months / 12 = 40 years

However, this is the total number of years Lauren needs to work to save $800,000. Since she already has a retirement period of 20 years, we need to subtract that from the total number of years:

40 years - 20 years = 20 years

"To find the total population of the school, we need to use the information given about the boys. Since 40% of the school population is 240 boys, we can set up the equation:

40% of total population = 240

To find the total population, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:

0.4 * total population = 240

Now, we can solve for the total population by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.4:

total population = 240 / 0.4
total population = 600

Now that we know the total population, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total population:

number of girls = total population - number of boys
number of girls = 600 - 240
number of girls = 360

The final answer is: 360"

"To find the average height of heels at the party, we need to first find the total height of all the heels and then divide it by the total number of women.

The total number of women is 6 (3 wearing 4 inch heels and 3 wearing 2 inch heels).

The total height of the heels for the women wearing 4 inch heels is 3 * 4 = 12 inches.
The total height of the heels for the women wearing 2 inch heels is 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

The average height of heels at the party is 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Since Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days, we can calculate her daily target by dividing the total miles by the number of days:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Soledad is planning to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is a total of 250 miles per day. To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we subtract her planned daily miles from her target daily miles:

310 miles per day - 250 miles per day = 60 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total amount the store will receive after selling all the balls, we need to calculate the total revenue from each color of ball and add them together.

The store has 3 red balls, and each red ball costs $9. So, the total revenue from red balls is 3 * $9 = $27.

The store has 11 blue balls, and each blue ball costs $5. So, the total revenue from blue balls is 11 * $5 = $55.

The store has 25 green balls, and each green ball costs $3. So, the total revenue from green balls is 25 * $3 = $75.

Now, let's add the revenue from all the balls together: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157.

The store will receive a total of $157 after selling all the balls.

"To find out how much James will have left, we first need to determine how much Pierre and Paul will take. 

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg. 

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

So, Pierre and Paul will take 3 + 4 = 7 kg in total.

Since there are three people (Pierre, Paul, and Jacques), and we know that Pierre and Paul will take 7 kg, we can assume that Jacques will take the remaining amount. 

The total amount of apples is 12 kg, and Pierre and Paul will take 7 kg, so Jacques will have 12 - 7 = 5 kg.

"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he spent. He spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle, so the total amount spent is $5 + $19 = $24.

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Raymond had. He had $21 initially and spent $24, so we subtract 24 from 21.

$21 - $24 = -$3

However, since we can't have a negative amount of money, this means that Raymond doesn't have enough money to buy the puzzle. He is short $3.

But, if we consider the puzzle purchase as an error in the problem, we can calculate the amount of money he has left after buying the comic book. 

$21 - $5 = $16

So, if we ignore the puzzle purchase, Raymond has $16 left."

Since Anna bought 2 books and they both cost the same amount of money, we can divide the total amount she spent ($14) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

Cost of each book = Total amount spent / Number of books
Cost of each book = $14 / 2
Cost of each book = $7

The final answer is: $7"
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we need to calculate 20% of the previous year's enrollment and add it to the previous year's enrollment.

20% of 50 is 0.20 x 50 = 10.

So, the increase in enrollment is 10 students.

To find the total number of students this year, we add the increase to the previous year's enrollment: 50 + 10 = 60.

Therefore, there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year.

60"
"To find out how long it will take the light to blink 459 times, we need to first determine the rate at which the light blinks. 

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. To find the rate, we divide the number of blinks by the time taken: 255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take for the light to blink 459 times. We can do this by dividing the total number of blinks by the rate: 459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute.

459 / 51 = 9 minutes.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total number of male and female fishes, we need to add the initial and the additional numbers of each type.

Initial male guppies: 4
Additional male guppies: 2
Total male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6

Initial female guppies: 7
Additional female guppies: 1
Total female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8

Initial male goldfishes: 3
Additional male goldfishes: 2
Total male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5

Initial female goldfishes: 5
Additional female goldfishes: 3
Total female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's find the total number of male and female fishes.
Total male fishes: 6 (guppies) + 5 (goldfishes) = 11
Total female fishes: 8 (guppies) + 8 (goldfishes) = 16

To find the difference between the number of female and male fishes, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes.
Difference: 16 (female fishes) - 11 (male fishes) = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total time they all took to do their chores, we need to calculate the time each person took and add them together.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took 4 hours longer than Amalia, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, let's add the time each person took to do their chores: 4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours.

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"To find the total distance John drives in a round trip, we need to calculate the distance of a single trip and then multiply it by 2.

The distance of a single trip is calculated by multiplying the speed by the time. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

Since John makes two trips a month, we need to multiply the distance of a single trip by 2.

Total Distance = 2 * 140 miles
Total Distance = 280 miles

So, John drives 280 miles a month when visiting his parents.

280"
"To find out how many miles Brian will walk in 7 days, we first need to determine how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we multiply 10 miles by 7 days.

10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we can set up an equation where Sofie's distance is twice Brian's distance. Let's represent Brian's distance as B. 

70 miles = 2 * B

To find Brian's distance, we divide both sides of the equation by 2.

B = 70 miles / 2
B = 35 miles

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

The final answer is: 35"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers and then find out how many toys the fifth worker must produce to meet the remaining demand.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour. Since they work for 10 hours, they produce a total of 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys.

Next, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the other 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour. Since they work for 10 hours, they produce a total of 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys.

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to meet the order, the fifth worker must produce 20 toys in 10 hours.

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker (20) by the number of hours worked (10). 

20 / 10 = 2

The fifth worker produces 2 toys per hour."
"To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we first need to find the weight of each of his dogs. 

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/4 to find the weight of Elijah's first dog: 60 * 1/4 = 15 pounds.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/2 to find the weight of Elijah's second dog: 60 * 1/2 = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of Elijah's two dogs to find the total weight of his dogs: 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

To find the total weight of all three dogs, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs: 60 + 45 = 105 pounds.

The final answer is: 105"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Seth had x stickers in the beginning.

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received x/2 stickers.

Luis used half of the stickers he received, which is (x/2)/2 = x/4 stickers. He gave the rest to Kris, so Kris received x/2 - x/4 = x/4 stickers.

Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. This means Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers.

Since Kris received x/4 stickers from Luis, we can set up the equation x/4 = 16 to find the value of x.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 4: x = 16 * 4
x = 64

So, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

The final answer is: 64"
"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to calculate the total weight of the M&M's and then multiply it by the number of M&M's per ounce. 

First, let's find the total weight of the M&M's: 3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces.

Since an ounce of M&M's has 30 M&M's, the total number of M&M's is 30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's.

Now, we need to find out how many small bags John can make. Each small bag contains 10 M&M's, so we divide the total number of M&M's by 10: 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per small bag = 90 small bags.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to first calculate half of the circumference of the earth. 

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of that would be 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers. We know that Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. 

To find the number of days, we can divide the total distance (20,000 kilometers) by the distance Alfie flies per day (400 kilometers). 

20,000 / 400 = 50 days.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the speed of the fastest car, we first need to find the speed of the 2nd fastest car. We know that the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, which is 120 miles per hour. 

Speed of the 2nd fastest car = 5 * 120 miles per hour = 600 miles per hour.

Now, we know that the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. 

Speed of the fastest car = 1.25 * 600 miles per hour = 750 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 750"
"To find Vince's current age, we first need to determine Liam's age two years ago. Since Liam is 16 now, two years ago he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince, so we can set up an equation: 14 = 2 * Vince's age two years ago.

To find Vince's age two years ago, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: Vince's age two years ago = 14 / 2 = 7.

Since we want to find Vince's current age, we need to add 2 to his age two years ago: Vince's current age = 7 + 2 = 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so let's call this number A.
- Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's call the number of eggs Sarah painted S. Then, Camden painted S + 12 eggs.
- Since Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, we can write the equation: S + (S + 12) = 30.
- Simplifying the equation, we get 2S + 12 = 30.
- Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get 2S = 18.
- Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 9.
- Since Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.
- We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. So, the total number of eggs painted by Arnold, Madeline, and Camden is 30. Since Camden painted 21 eggs, the total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline is 30 - 21 = 9. 
- Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, each of them painted 9 / 2 = 4.5 eggs. However, you can't paint half an egg, so we'll assume that they each painted 4 eggs, and the remaining 1 egg was either painted by one of them or it was not counted in the total. For the sake of this problem, we will assume that they each painted 4 eggs.
- Now, we can find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold: 21 - 4 = 17.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we first need to find the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes separately.

Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce and Nik has 200 crayons, the total weight of the crayons is 200 ounces.

Since each box weighs 8 ounces and Nik has 200 crayons, he will need 200 / 8 = 25 boxes. The total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces to a pound, we can convert the total weight from ounces to pounds by dividing by 16: 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much John makes, we first need to determine how many logs he can make from the tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we calculate 80% of 80 feet.

80% of 80 feet = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet long, we divide the total length of the usable tree by the length of each log to find the number of logs.

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

From each log, he cuts 5 planks. So, we multiply the number of logs by the number of planks per log.

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

He sells each plank for $1.2. To find the total amount he makes, we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we first need to determine the monthly earnings of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of what her brother earns. So, her brother's monthly earnings are 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is 2 * ($5000 + $10,000) = 2 * $15,000 = $30,000.

Now, we add up their monthly earnings to find the total amount of money they all have together: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out Grandma's speed on the beach and on the sidewalk. 

Let's assume Grandma's speed on the beach is x miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she spends 40 minutes on the beach. 

The time it takes to walk 2 miles on the beach is 2/x. The time it takes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is 1/(2x).

Since the total time spent on the beach is 40 minutes, we can set up the equation: 2/x = 40.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by x, which gives us 2 = 40x. Then, we divide both sides by 40, which gives us x = 1/20.

Now that we know Grandma's speed on the beach is 1/20 miles per minute, we can find her speed on the sidewalk, which is 2x = 2(1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute.

The time it takes to walk 2 miles on the beach is 2/(1/20) = 40 minutes. The time it takes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is 1/(1/10) = 10 minutes.

The total time it takes to complete the entire 3-mile walk is 40 + 10 = 50 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Jane to save a total of $60, we first need to calculate how much she has saved so far. 

Jane has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved is 4 * 8 = $32.

Since she wants to save a total of $60, we need to find out how much more she needs to save. This is 60 - 32 = $28.

Since she saves $4 per week, we can find out how many weeks it will take her to save $28 by dividing 28 by 4. 

28 / 4 = 7.

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

The final answer is: 7"

3 trees * 7 blue birds/tree = 21 blue birds

Next, let's calculate the number of blue birds in the 2 trees with 4 blue birds each:
2 trees * 4 blue birds/tree = 8 blue birds

Then, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the number of blue birds in each group together:
21 blue birds + 8 blue birds + 3 blue birds = 32 blue birds

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24. 

So, initially, Bob had 60 - 24 = 36 marbles.

Now, if he loses 10 marbles, we need to subtract 10 from the initial number of marbles he had. 

36 - 10 = 26

Therefore, Bob will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature of the second bottle of water. 

Let's denote the temperature of the second bottle as x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle into his water bottle, the total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces. 

Since the temperature of the mixture is at least 40 degrees, we can set up the following equation:

(33 * 4 + x * 1) / 5 >= 40

Simplifying the equation:

132 + x >= 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x >= 68

So, the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of cows. Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 21 days in three weeks. 

Number of cows added in three weeks = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of cows = Initial number of cows + Number of cows added
Total number of cows = 50 + 420
Total number of cows = 470

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens. Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. 

Number of chickens added in three weeks = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
Total number of chickens = Initial number of chickens + Number of chickens added
Total number of chickens = 20 + 210
Total number of chickens = 230

Now, let's add the total number of cows and chickens to find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks.

Total number of animals = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens
Total number of animals = 470 + 230
Total number of animals = 700

"To find the cost of each single bagel, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels with the discount. 

The original price of 4 packs of bagels is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00. 
Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $40.00. 
10% of $40.00 is 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00. 
So, the discounted price of 4 packs of bagels is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00. 

Now, we need to find the total number of bagels in 4 packs. 
Each pack has 9 bagels, so 4 packs have 4 * 9 = 36 bagels. 

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the discounted price by the total number of bagels. 
The cost of each single bagel is $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate, we first need to determine how many scoops 1 less than 3 scoops is. 3 scoops minus 1 is 2 scoops.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops, which is 3 less than 6 potatoes for 2 scoops. 6 minus 3 is 3 potatoes for 2 scoops.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. If 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, then 1.5 potatoes make 1 scoop. 

Now, we know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. 23 minus 5 is 18 scoops.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate. If 1 scoop is equal to 1.5 potatoes, then 18 scoops is equal to 18 * 1.5 potatoes. 18 * 1.5 is 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, and then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days is 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester increases his egg consumption to 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days is 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

Now, we add the total number of eggs from both periods: 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens: 240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen eggs.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to determine the total number of red jellybeans. We know there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans. 

So, the number of red jellybeans = 2 * 17 = 34.

We also know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can find the total number of green and red jellybeans by adding the number of green and red jellybeans together. 

Total green and red jellybeans = 17 (green) + 34 (red) = 51.

Now, we can find the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans.

Number of blue jellybeans = Total jellybeans - Total green and red jellybeans

First, let's find the total number of lemons he collects in one year. He has 5 trees and each tree gives him 6 lemons per year. 

Total lemons per year = Number of trees * Lemons per tree per year
Total lemons per year = 5 * 6
Total lemons per year = 30

Now, we multiply the total lemons per year by 10 to find the total lemons in a decade.

Total lemons in a decade = Total lemons per year * 10
Total lemons in a decade = 30 * 10
Total lemons in a decade = 300

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women on the bus initially. 

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can let the number of men be 5x and the number of women be 9x. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the equation: 5x + 9x = 84

Combine like terms: 14x = 84

Divide both sides by 14: x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of women on the bus initially: 9x = 9 * 6 = 54

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining is: 54 - 20 = 34

"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we need to first determine how many bouquets he sold. We know that each bouquet has 12 sunflowers and costs $8. 

Faraday earned $56 from the bouquets per day. To find out how many bouquets he sold, we can divide the total earnings from bouquets by the cost of each bouquet: $56 / $8 = 7 bouquets per day.

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers sold from bouquets per day is 7 * 12 = 84 sunflowers.

Now, let's find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold per day from individual sales. We know that he earned $26 from individual sunflowers per day and each sunflower costs $2. To find out how many sunflowers he sold, we can divide the total earnings from individual sunflowers by the cost of each sunflower: $26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers per day.

Now, we need to find the total number of sunflowers sold per day. We add the number of sunflowers sold from individual sales and bouquets: 84 + 13 = 97 sunflowers per day.

To find the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days, we multiply the number of sunflowers sold per day by 3: 97 * 3 = 291 sunflowers.

"To find out how much money Adam loses, we first need to determine how many rocks he can buy with his $100. 

Since each rock costs $5, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of each rock: 

$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Adam can buy 20 rocks. 

Now, let's calculate how much money he can make by selling 60% of his inventory. 

60% of 20 rocks is 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks.

Since he sells each rock for $7, the total amount of money he makes is: 

12 rocks * $7 = $84

However, Adam invested all his money in the rock stand, which is $100. To find out how much he loses, we subtract the money he made from the initial investment:

"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene. 

First, let's find the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene:

- Large-sized picture scenes: 45 / 5 = 9 days
- Medium-sized picture scenes: 36 / 6 = 6 days
- Small-sized picture scenes: 49 / 7 = 7 days

Now, we need to find the LCM of 9, 6, and 7. 

The prime factorization of 6 is 2 * 3.
The prime factorization of 7 is 7.
The prime factorization of 9 is 3 * 3.

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:
- The highest power of 2 is 2 (from 6).
- The highest power of 3 is 3 * 3 (from 9).
- The highest power of 7 is 7 (from 7).

So, the LCM is 2 * 3 * 3 * 7 = 42.

Therefore, it will take Lauren 42 days to complete all the picture scenes.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which is 0.2 in decimal form. 

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 times the probability of the first ticket. Since the first ticket has a 20% chance, the second ticket has a 60% chance (3 * 20% = 60%). In decimal form, this is 0.6.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

- Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.
- Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. This means Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

Now, let's find the total number of seashells collected by all three. 
Total seashells = Jim's seashells + Carlos' seashells + Carrey's seashells
Total seashells = 27 + 22 + 11
Total seashells = 60

They divided the seashells equally among themselves. 
Number of people = 3
Seashells per person = Total seashells / Number of people
Seashells per person = 60 / 3
Seashells per person = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and add the number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday). So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 + 5 = 10.

Now, let's add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend: 20 + 10 = 30.

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. 

The second song is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes. To find 60% of 5 minutes, we multiply 5 by 0.6. 

5 * 0.6 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song. To find the total length of the second song, we add 3 minutes to the length of the first song.

5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now, we have the lengths of both songs: the first song is 5 minutes and the second song is 8 minutes. To find the total time of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs.

5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

"To find the total profit, we first need to calculate the profit from each device. 

The cost price of one device is $20, and the selling price is twice the cost price, which is 2 * $20 = $40.

The profit from one device is the selling price minus the cost price, which is $40 - $20 = $20.

Linus bought 2 devices on Monday, so the profit from Monday's sales is 2 * $20 = $40.

He bought 4 devices on Tuesday, so the profit from Tuesday's sales is 4 * $20 = $80.

The total profit is the sum of the profit from Monday and Tuesday, which is $40 + $80 = $120.

The total profit Linus was able to earn after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday is $120."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Isabel is 7 feet tall.
2. Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned's height is 7 - 2 = 5 feet.
3. Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, so Carl's height is 5 + 1 = 6 feet.
4. Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, so the length of the cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet.

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles required to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

Since each juice can cover 20% of one person's daily energy demand, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, we need 100 / 20 = 5 bottles.

For 2300 people, we need 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, to find out how many more bottles it needs to produce, we subtract the number of bottles it can produce from the total number of bottles required: 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

The final answer is: 7300"
"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we first need to determine the number of babies wearing purple and bows, and the total number of babies wearing bows.

Let's assume there are 8 babies in total since Carla gave birth to octuplets. 

3/4 of the babies are dressed in purple, which is (3/4) * 8 = 6 babies. 
1/4 of the babies are dressed in blue, which is (1/4) * 8 = 2 babies.

Now, we need to find the number of babies wearing bows. All 2 babies wearing blue also wear bows. Additionally, 1/3 of the purple babies wear bows, which is (1/3) * 6 = 2 babies. So, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4 babies.

The number of babies wearing purple and bows is 2.

To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we divide the number of babies wearing purple and bows by the total number of babies wearing bows, and then multiply by 100.

(2 / 4) * 100 = 50%

"To find out how many reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday, and then subtract that result from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports received last week = 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

First, let's find the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday. 

Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Now, let's subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday. 

Reports received on Thursday and Friday - Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 2136 - 1907 = 229

Now, let's subtract the result from the total number of reports received last week to find the number of reports received on Wednesday.

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received last week - (Reports received on Monday and Tuesday + Reports received on Thursday and Friday - Reports received on Thursday and Friday)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136 - 2136)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 1907
Reports received on Wednesday = 3261

Reports received on Wednesday = 3261"
"To find out how much money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land, we need to calculate the total amount of money he earned from each sale and add it up.

First, Abraham sold half of his land for $50. Since he owns 80 square meters, half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. 

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Since he owns 80 square meters, 1/4 of that is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters. 

Now, let's calculate the total amount of land he has left. He sold 40 + 20 = 60 square meters, so he has 80 - 60 = 20 square meters left.

He then sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, the amount of money he earned from selling the remaining land is 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money he earned from each sale: $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find Geb's age, we need to first calculate half of Haley's age. Haley is 26 years old, so half of her age would be 26 / 2 = 13.

13 - 10 = 3

Geb is 3 years old."
"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to first determine how many face masks he uses in a day. 

Since Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out and he goes out three times a day, the total number of face masks he uses in a day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, to find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses in a day by 2. 

6 * 2 = 12

So, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. Since a dozen is 12, we can calculate the total number of eggs as 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs, so the remaining number of eggs is 36 - 5 = 31.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, which means she finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs. Now, the remaining number of eggs is 31 - 10 = 21.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so he finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. The remaining number of eggs is now 21 - 8 = 13.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, which means she finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs. The remaining number of eggs is 13 - 4 = 9.

Therefore, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is 9."
"To find out how much money John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments in each complex and then the total number of collections he makes in a week.

The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so the total number of apartments in these two complexes is 200 + 200 = 400.

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, which means it is 160% of 400 (100% of 400 + 60% of 400). To find 160% of 400, we multiply 400 by 1.6 (which is the decimal form of 160%): 400 * 1.6 = 640.

So, the total number of apartments in all three complexes is 400 + 640 = 1040.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections he makes in a week is 3 * 1040 = 3120.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so the total amount of money he makes in a week is 3120 * $0.40 = $1248.

"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree, we need to calculate the fruits produced each year and add them up.

- In the 5th year, the tree produces 50 fruits.
- In the 6th year, it produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- In the 7th year, it produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- In the 8th year, it produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Since a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits, an 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.
- In the 9th year, the tree doesn't produce any fruits.
- In the 10th year, it produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, let's add up the fruits produced each year: 
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

"To find out how much money Jack has now, we need to calculate the amount Sophia gave him and add it to his initial amount.

Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100. To find 1/5 of $100, we multiply $100 by 1/5, which is the same as dividing $100 by 5.

$100 / 5 = $20

So, Sophia gave Jack $20. 

Now, we add the amount Sophia gave Jack to his initial amount:

$100 (initial amount) + $20 (amount given by Sophia) = $120

Jack now has $120.

"Let's break down the information given. 

Let the length of the blue rope be x. 
Since the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, the length of the yellow rope is x + 7. 
The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so its length is 4x. 

The total length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 7) + 4x = 37.

Combine like terms: 6x + 7 = 37.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 6x = 30.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 5.

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope: 4x = 4 * 5 = 20.

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume Ronnie was given $5 initially. Since Rissa was given thrice as much, Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's call the amount given to the little sister 'x'. So, Ronnie is left with $5 - x and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

According to the problem, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. This means (15 - x) = (4/5) * 15. 

To find the value of x, we can solve the equation: 
(15 - x) = (4/5) * 15
15 - x = 12
x = 3

Now that we know x, we can find out how much money Ronnie is left with:
Ronnie's money = $5 - x
= $5 - 3
= $2

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that there are four colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow. We also know that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, so let's call the amount of each of these colors 'x'. 

Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, so the sum of the amounts of red, white, and purple paint is 12 - 6 = 6 pints. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can write the equation: x + x + x = 6.

Combine like terms: 3x = 6.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 2.

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, the amount of red paint is x = 2 pints.

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, then add them together.

First, let's find the area of one bedroom: 
Area of one bedroom = length * width = 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms = 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area = 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas together: 
Total area = area of bedrooms + area of living room + area of the rest of the house
Total area = 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

"To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run with the new box for $1, we first need to determine how many pods are in the new box. 

The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box. To find 20% of 100, we multiply 100 by 0.2, which is 20. So, the new box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, we know that the new box costs $12 and has 120 pods. To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to find out how many pods you can buy for $1. Since the new box costs $12 for 120 pods, we divide $12 by 120 to get the cost per pod, which is $0.1 per pod.

Now, we know that each cycle requires 1 pod, and we want to know how many cycles we can run for $1. Since each pod costs $0.1, we can run 1 / 0.1 = 10 cycles for $1.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. This means he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he is left with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which is 40 / 2 = 20 bills. So, he is left with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

Thomas then triples his money, which means he triples the number of bills. So, he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since each bill is now worth $5, the total amount of money he has is 60 * 5 = $300.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. 

Now, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

The total number of goals scored by team A is 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals. The total number of goals scored by team B is 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much chalk the teacher has left after Monday and then determine how many days it will last.

The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. He uses 45% of it on Monday, so we need to find 45% of 5 inches.

45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

This means the teacher has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk left after Monday.

Now, we need to find out how many days the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk will last when the teacher uses 20% of it each day.

Let's assume the number of days the chalk will last is 'x'. Then, 20% of 2.75 inches will be used each day.

0.20 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches per day

Since the teacher starts with 2.75 inches, we can set up the equation:

2.75 = 0.55x

To solve for 'x', we divide both sides by 0.55:

x = 2.75 / 0.55
x = 5

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Colin's current age as C and Wendy's current age as W.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:
20 = C

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we first need to determine the total number of books he can buy with $27000. 

Since he can buy 100 books for $500, we can find the total number of books by dividing the total amount spent ($27000) by the cost per 100 books ($500).

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost per 100 books
Total number of books = $27000 / $500
Total number of books = 54

Now that we know Bob can buy 54 books in total, we need to find out how many books he can buy per school. Since he is distributing the books to 3 schools, we divide the total number of books by 3.

"To find out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza is needed for. 

For the cheese pizza, each friend eats 6 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of cheese pizza slices needed is 6 friends * 6 slices = 36 slices. 

For the pepperoni pizza, each friend eats 4 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices needed is 6 friends * 4 slices = 24 slices.

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to find out how many whole pizzas of each type Kate needs to buy. 

For the cheese pizza, we need 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas. 

For the pepperoni pizza, we need 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many snowballs Jay builds and how many melt in a given time frame. 

First, let's calculate how many snowballs Jay builds in 15 minutes. Since he can build 20 snowballs in an hour, we need to find out how many he builds in 15 minutes. 

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in 15 minutes, Jay builds (20 snowballs / 60 minutes) * 15 minutes = 5 snowballs.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. So, the net number of snowballs Jay has after 15 minutes is 5 - 2 = 3 snowballs.

Now, let's find out how many 15-minute intervals it will take to reach 60 snowballs. We can do this by dividing 60 by the net number of snowballs Jay has after each 15-minute interval, which is 3.

60 / 3 = 20 intervals of 15 minutes.

Since each interval is 15 minutes, we multiply the number of intervals by 15 to find the total time.

20 intervals * 15 minutes = 300 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60.

300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

John's age 20 years ago = 28 - 20 = 8

Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we can set up an equation to find Jim's age at that time:

John's age 20 years ago = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago
8 = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago

To find Jim's age 20 years ago, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Jim's age 20 years ago = 8 / 2
Jim's age 20 years ago = 4

Now, we need to find Jim's current age by adding 20 to his age 20 years ago:

Jim's current age = Jim's age 20 years ago + 20
Jim's current age = 4 + 20
Jim's current age = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Doxa ate 1 slice of the apple. 
Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, let's add up the number of slices each of them ate: 
Doxa ate 1 slice, her sister ate 2 slices, and her brother ate 3 slices. 
So, the total number of slices they ate is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as 'x'. 

On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the remaining bandages after the first day are x - 38 + 50.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The remaining bandages after the second day are (x - 38 + 50) - 28.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages (2 * 50 = 100) and used half a pack (50 / 2 = 25 bandages). The remaining bandages after the third day are ((x - 38 + 50) - 28) - 25 + 100.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation:

(x - 38 + 50) - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78

Simplifying the equation:

x - 38 + 50 - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78
x + 57 = 78

Subtracting 57 from both sides:

x = 21

"To find the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut first. The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, and her hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches. 

The length of hair cut is 10 - 8 = 2 inches. 

The cost of the haircut is 2 inches * $30 per inch = $60.

The cost of the color is $40.

The total cost is $60 (haircut) + $40 (color) = $100.

"To find Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her regular pay and her attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay. She works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week, and there are 4 weeks in April. 

Total hours worked in a week = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week
Total hours worked in April = 45 hours/week * 4 weeks = 180 hours

Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her total regular pay for April is:
Total regular pay = 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since Jen has complete attendance for the month, she receives an additional $10 for the attendance bonus. 

Total earnings = Total regular pay + Attendance bonus
Total earnings = $270 + $10
Total earnings = $280

The final answer is: $280"
"To find out how much Jason earned, we need to calculate the total amount he earned for each task and then add them up.

For doing laundry, Jason earned $3.00 once, so that's $3.00.
For cleaning his room, Jason earned $1.50 once, so that's $1.50.
For taking the trash to the curb, Jason earned $0.75 twice, so that's 2 x $0.75 = $1.50.
For emptying the dishwasher, Jason earned $0.50 six times, so that's 6 x $0.50 = $3.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount Jason earned: $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 + $3.00 = $8.00.

Then, 40 more people entered at 10:00. 
Next, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. 
Finally, 3 times as many people as the number that came in first (50) entered by evening, which is 3 * 50 = 150 people.

Now, let's add up the number of people who entered at each time: 
50 (morning) + 40 (10:00) + 80 (lunch) + 150 (evening) = 320

The total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we first need to determine the number of red pens and black pens separately.

Since Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack has 5 pens, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

It's given that she bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. So, the number of black pens is 2 * 25 = 50 black pens.

To find the total number of pens Alain has, we add the number of red pens and black pens: 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

The final answer is: 75"
"To find the total amount John spent, we first need to determine the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. To find the cost per bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles: $600 / 10 = $60 per bottle.

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of the cognac is 50% more than the scotch, so the cost per bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $90.

Now, we can find the total cost of the cognac: 20 bottles * $90 per bottle = $1800.

To find the total amount John spent, we add the cost of the scotch and the cognac: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. He also planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which means he planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it a total of 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day. Since he planted 40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day, 1/4 of that is 40 * 1/4 = 10. So, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

To find the total number of trees planted in the two days, we need to add the number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees planted on both days. 

Total White Oak trees = 20 (first day) + 10 (second day) = 30
Total Lodgepole Pine trees = 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90

Total number of trees = Total White Oak trees + Total Lodgepole Pine trees = 30 + 90 = 120

"To find out how much root beer was available for each person to drink, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer left after all the incidents. 

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer. 

On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed by his children. So, the remaining amount is 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled. So, the remaining amount is 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.

On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed by Ronnie. So, the remaining amount is 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, and they shared the remaining root beer equally. To find out how much each person got, we need to divide the remaining amount by the number of people. 

8 gallons / 3 people = 2.67 gallons per person.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as 'x'. 

The problem states that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be translated into the equation: 4x + 8 = 40.

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable. First, we'll subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 4x = 40 - 8.

This simplifies to: 4x = 32.

Next, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for 'x': x = 32 / 4.

x = 8.

One-third of 66 is 66 / 3 = 22.

Now, we need to find the number of fish that do not have red stripes. Since 22 fish have red stripes, the remaining fish are 66 - 22 = 44.

Now, we need to find 5/11 of the remaining fish that have blue stripes. 

5/11 of 44 is (5/11) * 44 = 20.

So, the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is 22 + 20 = 42.

"Let's break down the information given. Amy initially had two eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors from the palettes. 

She also had three makeup sets with 6 eyeshadow colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister stole one of the palettes, which means Amy lost 4 eyeshadow colors. So, she now has 26 - 4 = 22 eyeshadow colors.

Amy then used up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set has 6 eyeshadow colors, half of that would be 6 / 2 = 3 eyeshadow colors.

So, Amy used up 3 eyeshadow colors from the makeup set. Now, she has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we first need to determine the height of the two-story house and the first floor.

Mattison's height is 60 inches. The two-story house is 7 times as high as he is, so the total height of the two-story house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The first floor's floor to ceiling height is thrice as high as Mattison's height, which is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Since the two-story house is 420 inches high, and the first floor's height is 180 inches, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is the same as the height of the second floor, which is 240 inches.

"To find the number of shells found by team Alphas, we need to calculate 40% of 700. 

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

Now, we know that team Alphas found 280 shells. The remaining shells are 700 - 280 = 420.

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells, which is 60% of 420.

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Now, we know that team Alphas found 280 shells and team The finders found 252 shells. To find the number of shells found by team Gogetters, we subtract the total shells found by Alphas and The finders from the total number of shells.

Total shells found by Alphas and The finders = 280 + 252 = 532

Shells found by Gogetters = Total shells - Total shells found by Alphas and The finders

Now, let's add up the miles the first three dogs need to walk: 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the miles the first three dogs need to walk from the total miles: 12 - 8 = 4 miles.

The last dog needs to walk 4 miles."
"To find out how much money John got from the loan, we need to calculate 40% of the value of his house. 

40% of $250,000 = 0.4 * $250,000 = $100,000

Now, John uses 60% of this amount to pay off his debts. 

60% of $100,000 = 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000

This means John paid off $60,000 of his debt. To find out how much money he has leftover, we subtract this amount from the loan amount.

$100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

So, John has $40,000 leftover after paying off his debt.

Total number of balloons = Number of packs * Number of balloons per pack
Total number of balloons = 10 * 30
Total number of balloons = 300

Since 12 balloons were left by the end of the afternoon, we can find the number of balloons thrown by subtracting the remaining balloons from the total number of balloons:

Number of balloons thrown = Total number of balloons - Remaining balloons
Number of balloons thrown = 300 - 12

"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we first need to find the capacity of John's school. 

Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we can find the capacity of one of John's classes by multiplying Ali's class capacity by 1/8. 

Capacity of one of John's classes = 120 * (1/8) = 15 students

Since John has two classes, we multiply the capacity of one class by 2 to find the total capacity of John's school.

Capacity of John's school = 15 * 2 = 30 students

Now, we add the capacity of Ali's school (which is 120 students) to the capacity of John's school to find the combined capacity of both schools.

Combined capacity = 120 + 30 = 150

"To find the total amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we first need to calculate the total interest he owes his sister. 

The interest is 2% of the initial $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6. 

However, Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount he pays in the first 11 months is 25 * 11 = $275.

The remaining amount, including the interest, will be paid in the twelfth month. This remaining amount is the initial $300 (the amount he borrowed) plus the interest ($6), minus the total amount he paid in the first 11 months ($275). 

So, the amount he will pay in the twelfth month is 300 + 6 - 275 = $31.

"To find the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we first need to calculate the volume of the jar. The jar has a square base with a side length of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. 

The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the jar) is calculated by multiplying the area of the base by the height. The area of the base is 6 * 6 = 36 square inches. 

The volume of the jar is 36 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans have an efficiency of 80%, we need to divide the volume of the jar by 0.8 to get the total volume that can be occupied by the jelly beans. 

Total volume for jelly beans = 540 / 0.8 = 675 cubic inches.

Since each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, we can find the total number of jelly beans by dividing the total volume for jelly beans by the volume of a single jelly bean.

Total number of jelly beans = 675 / 0.15 = 4500.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3.

Number of red jelly beans = 4500 * 0.3 = 1350.

However, we are given that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find how far off Tim's guess was, we need to know what his guess was. Since we don't have that information, we can't calculate the exact difference.

However, we can calculate the percentage difference between the true number of red jelly beans and the estimated number of red jelly beans. 

Percentage difference = ((true number - estimated number) / true number) * 100
= ((900 - 1350) / 900) * 100
= (-450 / 900) * 100
= -50%

Since the percentage difference is negative, it means Tim's guess was higher than the true number of red jelly beans.

The final answer is: $\boxed{-50}$"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. 

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 of 40 is (3/4) * 40 = 30. So, 30 people entered the bus at the second stop. The total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the remaining spaces, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

There are 4 grades (4-7) with 10 students in each grade, so the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40.

Since only the top 10 students in each grade get to try the escape room, we need to find the total number of students who will try the escape room. Since there are 4 grades, we need to find the total number of students who will try the escape room in each grade, which is 10 students per grade. So, the total number of students who will try the escape room is 4 * 10 = 40.

However, only 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students who will try the escape room by 8.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as 'x'. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. So, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet. 

We can write the equation as: x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms: 5x = 40

Now, divide both sides by 5 to solve for x: x = 8

Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x = 4 * 8 = 32

"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound to find the total pounds of meat needed.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Now that we know Aiden needs 5 pounds of ground beef, we can find out how much seasoning he needs. He adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat.

Total pounds of meat needed = 5
Seasoning per pound = 2 tablespoons

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat needed * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2

So, the discounted cost of both manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers in total (5 on each hand), the cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted cost of manicure and pedicure plus the cost of nail art, which is $60 + $30 = $90.

The final numerical answer is: $90"
"To find the total number of magazines Susan receives each year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them up.

The first 3 magazines send 12 issues a year, so that's 3 * 12 = 36 issues.

The second magazine sends 6 issues a year.

The third magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, which is 4 * 6 = 24 issues.

Now, let's add up the total number of issues: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

So, Susan receives 66 magazines every year.

The final answer is: 66"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Samantha has 27 paintings. Since Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, Shelley must have 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.

Now, we know Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. To find out how many paintings Kim has, we subtract 8 from Shelley's total: 39 - 8 = 31.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the price of the toy after the discount in January, we need to follow the given changes in price.

Initially, the price of the toy was $40.

In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we multiply the initial price by 1.8 (100% + 80% = 180%, or 1 + 0.8 = 1.8).

New price in December = $40 * 1.8 = $72

In January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we multiply the price in December by 0.5 (100% - 50% = 50%, or 1 - 0.5 = 0.5).

New price in January = $72 * 0.5 = $36

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the amount he earns from the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons separately and then add them together.

For the standard rate lessons, Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 per hour. So, the total amount he earns from these lessons is:
4 * $80 = $320

For the reduced rate lessons, Charlie has 2 lessons at a 25% discount on his standard rate. First, we need to find the reduced rate:
$80 - (25% of $80) = $80 - $20 = $60

Now, we can calculate the total amount he earns from the reduced rate lessons:
2 * $60 = $120

To find the total amount Charlie will make for the day, we add the amounts from the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons:
$320 + $120 = $440

The final answer is: $440"
"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and then divide by the total number of scores.

First, let's add up all the scores: 
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

The sum of all the scores is 630.

Next, we need to count the total number of scores, which is 9.

Now, we divide the sum by the total number of scores to find the mean:
630 Ã· 9 = 70

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to first determine what 1/4 of the original amount is. 

Since Eve had 20 pieces of pomelos originally, 1/4 of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5. 

This means Eve was left with 5 pomelos after giving some away. To find out how many she gave away, we subtract the remaining pomelos from the original amount: 20 - 5 = 15.

So, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

15"
"To find out how much money Walter received, we need to calculate the number of apples he had left after eating and giving some to his sister, and then multiply that by the price he sold them for.

First, Walter ate 2/5 of the 60 apples. To find out how many apples he ate, we multiply 60 by 2/5:
60 * (2/5) = 60 * 2 / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 apples

Now, we subtract the number of apples Walter ate from the total number of apples:
60 - 24 = 36 apples

Walter then gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples. To find out how many apples he gave her, we multiply 36 by 25% (or 0.25):
36 * 0.25 = 9 apples

Now, we subtract the number of apples Walter gave to his sister from the remaining apples:
36 - 9 = 27 apples

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find out how much money he received, we multiply the number of apples by the price:
27 * 3 = 81

"To find the total distance covered by Michael in 3 days, we need to calculate the distance he covers in one day and then multiply it by 3.

First, let's convert the speed from km/hr to km/day. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply 50 km/hr by 24 hours to get the distance covered in a day.

Distance covered in a day = 50 km/hr * 24 hr/day = 1200 km/day

Now, we multiply the distance covered in a day by 3 to get the total distance covered in 3 days.

Total distance covered in 3 days = 1200 km/day * 3 days = 3600 km

Now, we need to find the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered. To do this, we divide the total distance covered by Michael by the total distance between Alaska and Texas and multiply by 100.

Percentage covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
= 0.6 * 100
= 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass, so he used 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Each pie requires 12 grapes, so the total number of grapes used by their mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by all three is 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

Since we don't know the initial number of grapes, let's call it x. We know that x - 84 is the number of grapes left over. However, we are not given any information about the leftover grapes, so we can't determine the initial number of grapes.

However, we can express the initial number of grapes as x = 84 + leftover grapes. Since we don't have any information about the leftover grapes, we can't determine the exact initial number of grapes.

However, we can express the initial number of grapes as x = 84 + leftover grapes. Since we don't have any information about the leftover grapes, we can't determine the exact initial number of grapes."
"To find the total number of teachers at school that day, we need to add the number of teachers who were sick and the number of substitute teachers. 

First, let's find the number of teachers who were not sick. There were 82 teachers in total, and 13 were sick. So, the number of teachers who were not sick is 82 - 13 = 69.

However, this includes the 9 substitute teachers. To find the total number of teachers at school, we need to add the 9 substitute teachers to the 69 teachers who were not sick. 

So, the total number of teachers at school that day is 69 + 9 = 78.

"To find the total number of classrooms the custodian needs to clean, we already know that number is 80. 

The custodian has 5 days to clean the classrooms. We need to find out how many minutes they have to clean in total. Since they work 8 hours a day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, they work 8 * 60 = 480 minutes per day.

In 5 days, they work a total of 5 * 480 = 2400 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes they spend cleaning per classroom. We already know that it takes them 15 minutes per classroom.

To find the total time spent cleaning, we multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom: 80 * 15 = 1200 minutes.

Now, we need to find the percentage of their day spent cleaning. To do this, we divide the total time spent cleaning by the total time available and multiply by 100: (1200 / 2400) * 100 = 50%.

"Let's break down the information given. We know that each middle shelf can hold 10 books, and there are 2 middle shelves. So, the total capacity of the middle shelves is 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, which means it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase: 20 (middle) + 20 (bottom) + 15 (top) = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to find out how many bookcases she needs to hold all of them. To do this, we'll divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase: 110 / 55 = 2.

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"To find Rose's profit, we first need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The cost of five dozens of eggs is 5 * $2.40 = $12.

Since one dozen has 12 eggs, five dozens will have 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

Rose will sell each egg for $1, so the total revenue will be 60 * $1 = $60.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $60 - $12 = $48.

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and there's a $3.00 discount. 

$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Since the bag contains 30 sticks of jerky, we need to divide the discounted price by the number of sticks to find the cost per stick.

$15.00 Ã· 30 = $0.50

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100.

$0.50 * 100 = 50 cents

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as 's' and the number of blueberry cubes as 'b'. We are given that the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so we can write this as:

b = 5s - 4

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, which is the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes:

s + b = 116

Substituting the expression for b from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6s - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6s = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

s = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting s into the first equation:

b = 5s - 4
b = 5(20) - 4
b = 100 - 4
b = 96

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the family, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Next, let's calculate the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of 8 rooms is 4 rooms. So, 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, which is 4 * 4 = 16 small candles. The other 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each, which is 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles. 

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

"To find the total cost of the phone plan, we need to determine the cost of the additional phones and add it to the cost of the main phone.

Let's assume the cost of each additional phone is x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We know that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

The total cost of the phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones:

Total cost = 20 + 40
Total cost = 60

"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in a day and then multiply it by the number of days in June.

Since Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day, and 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can calculate the total number of doughnuts he makes in a day as follows:

10 dozen * 12 doughnuts/dozen = 120 doughnuts/day

Since Derrick sells all the doughnuts, we can assume he sells 120 doughnuts every day.

Now, let's calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

To find the total number of doughnuts Derrick sells in June, we multiply the number of doughnuts he sells in a day by the number of days in June:

"To find the new speaking speed of John after training, we need to multiply his original speed by 2.5. 

Original speed = 150 WPM
New speed = 2.5 * 150 WPM = 375 WPM

Now, we need to find the total number of words John needs to speak. Since each page has 450 words, and he needs to speak 10 pages, the total number of words is:

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words/page = 4500 words

Now, we can find the time it would take John to speak 4500 words at his new speed:

Time = Total words / New speed
Time = 4500 words / 375 WPM

To find the time in minutes, we need to divide the total words by the new speed and then convert the result to minutes.

Time = 4500 / 375 = 12 hours

However, we need to convert the result to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

Time = 12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes

However, the question asks for the time it would take to speak 10 pages, not the total time in minutes. We need to find the time it would take to speak 10 pages in minutes.

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the total number of people he saw on the first three days and add it to the total number of people he saw on the remaining days.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the number of people on the second day is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day, so the number of people on the third day is 2 * 70 = 140.

The total number of people on the first three days is 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, the total number of people he saw on the remaining days is 60 * 4 = 240.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 260 + 240 = 500.

The final answer is: 500"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop. 

In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.

In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to four times the initial rate, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, which is 0.5 * 80 = 40 kernels.

So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 120 seconds is 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels.

After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. This is 0.25 * 40 = 10 kernels.

The total number of kernels that popped is 200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

"To find out how many lemons Tim will need, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemonade he needs to make, including the extra gallon for Allen. 

Since Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade and 1 extra gallon, he will need to make a total of 5 gallons. 

For each gallon of lemonade, he needs 1 cup of lemon juice. Since he's making 5 gallons, he will need 5 cups of lemon juice.

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can find out how many lemons are needed for 5 cups of juice by multiplying 6 lemons by 5 cups. 

6 lemons * 5 cups = 30 lemons

So, Tim will need 30 lemons.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we first need to calculate the daily consumption of the dogs. 

There are 3 German Shepherds and 2 Bulldogs. 

The daily consumption of the German Shepherds is 3 * 5 = 15 kilograms. 
The daily consumption of the Bulldogs is 2 * 3 = 6 kilograms.

The total daily consumption is 15 + 6 = 21 kilograms.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total weekly consumption is 21 * 7 = 147 kilograms.

The Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of animal legs on the farm, we need to calculate the total number of legs from the 2-legged animals and the 4-legged animals separately and then add them together.

For the 2-legged animals, each animal has 2 legs. Since there are 10 2-legged animals, the total number of legs from these animals is 10 * 2 = 20.

For the 4-legged animals, each animal has 4 legs. Since there are 15 4-legged animals, the total number of legs from these animals is 15 * 4 = 60.

Now, we add the total number of legs from the 2-legged animals and the 4-legged animals to get the total number of legs on the farm: 20 + 60 = 80.

The total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is 80 / 2 = 40.

"To find the number of red blocks, we first need to determine the total number of blue and yellow blocks. We know there are 4 blue blocks and twice as many yellow blocks, so the number of yellow blocks is 4 * 2 = 8.

The total number of blue and yellow blocks is 4 + 8 = 12. 

Since there are 32 blocks in total, the number of red blocks can be found by subtracting the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks: 32 - 12 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the distance Elvis traveled west and then east, we need to multiply the speed by the time for each part of the journey.

Distance traveled west = Speed * Time = 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles
Distance traveled east = Speed * Time = 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the net distance from his house. The distance traveled east cancels out the distance traveled west, so we subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east.

Net distance from his house = Distance traveled east - Distance traveled west = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and subtract it from the initial value.

Initial value of the boat = $9000

First year depreciation: 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Second year depreciation: 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Third year depreciation: 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after third year = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The final value of the boat after three years is $3528.

The final answer is: $3528"
"To find the number of pink candies, we first need to determine the number of orange and yellow candies. 

We know there are 54 red candies. Since there are twice as many orange candies as red candies, the number of orange candies is 2 * 54 = 108.

We also know there are half as many yellow candies as red candies, so the number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, we can find the total number of non-pink candies by adding the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

Since there are 232 candies in total, the number of pink candies is 232 - 189 = 43.

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus trips is 7 * $8 = $56.

The total cost of the hotel and bus travels is $240 + $56 = $296.

The final answer is: $296"
"To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we first need to determine how many marbles Dallas received. We know that Dallas had 21 marbles after dropping 4, so we can find the number of marbles he received by adding the marbles he dropped back to the marbles he has now.

Dallas received 21 + 4 = 25 marbles.

Since Mazie gave a total of 52 marbles to the twins, and Dallas received 25, we can find out how many marbles Darla received by subtracting the number of marbles Dallas received from the total number of marbles given.

Darla received 52 - 25 = 27 marbles.

"To find the total weight of the car, luggage, and children, we need to add the individual weights together. 

Total weight = weight of the car + weight of luggage + weight of children
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + (2 * 75)
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Since the force needed to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we need to calculate 1% of 1600.

Force needed = 1% * 1600
Force needed = 0.01 * 1600
Force needed = 16 pounds

"To determine the amount of crepe paper James needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of the backyard fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2l + 2w, where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the length (l) is 20 feet and the width (w) is 15 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(20) + 2(15)
P = 40 + 30
P = 70

So, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to go around the entire fence.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the average age of Mia and Emma, we first need to determine Emma's age. Since Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart in age, we can calculate Emma's age by adding 16 to Mia's age.

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now that we know both Mia's and Emma's ages, we can find the average of their ages by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

Next, we subtract the number of cracked seashells from the total: 
732 - 67 = 665

So, the total number of good seashells they found together is 665."
"To find the total cost of the place settings, we need to calculate the cost of each type of plate and then add them together.

Avery needs 12 dinner plates, and each costs $6.00, so the total cost of dinner plates is 12 x $6.00 = $72.00.

She also needs 12 bowls, and each costs $5.00, so the total cost of bowls is 12 x $5.00 = $60.00.

For the salad plates, she needs 12 as well, and each costs $4.00, so the total cost of salad plates is 12 x $4.00 = $48.00.

Now, let's add the costs of all the plates together: $72.00 (dinner plates) + $60.00 (bowls) + $48.00 (salad plates) = $180.00.

The total amount Avery will spend on place settings is $180.00.

"To find out how much feed is left after a week, we first need to calculate how much feed the pigs eat in a day and then multiply it by 7 to get the weekly consumption.

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so the total feed consumed by one pig in a day is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

Since Dexter has 5 pigs, the total feed consumed by all pigs in a day is 8 * 5 = 40 pounds.

Now, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 to get the weekly consumption: 40 * 7 = 280 pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so to find out how much is left, we subtract the weekly consumption from the total ordered: 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

"To find out how many hot dogs John needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the party. 

Since each guest will eat 2 hot dogs and there are 20 guests, the total number of hot dogs needed is 20 * 2 = 40 hot dogs.

However, John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. So, the total number of hot dogs he needs to buy is 40 - 4 = 36 hot dogs.

Since a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2, we need to find out how many packs John needs to buy. 

To do this, we divide the total number of hot dogs needed by the number of hot dogs in a pack: 36 / 6 = 6.

Since each pack costs $2, the total amount John needs to spend on hot dogs is 6 * $2 = $12.

She sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 20 x $2 = $40.
She sells 40 cookies at $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 40 x $1 = $40.
Her total earnings are $40 (cupcakes) + $40 (cookies) = $80.

Next, let's calculate her total expenses. She buys 5 trays at $4 each, so her total expenses are 5 x $4 = $20.

Now, let's subtract her total expenses from her total earnings to find out how much money she has left.
$80 (total earnings) - $20 (total expenses) = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there are 5 children following the truck.

On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child, so the total number of children becomes 5 + 5 = 10.

On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children, so the total number of children becomes 10 + (10 * 2) = 10 + 20 = 30.

The original 5 children then give up and leave the group, so we subtract 5 from the total number of children: 30 - 5 = 25.

Therefore, there are 25 children now following the truck.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to calculate the total number of meals she has given out and subtract that from the total number of meals she has.

On Friday, she gave out 64 meals.
On Saturday, she gave out 30 meals.
On Sunday, she gave out 48 meals.

Total meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48 = 142 meals

Total meals Mamou has = 1,360 meals
Meals left to distribute = Total meals - Total meals given out
= 1,360 - 142
= 1,218 meals

"To find the total age of all the siblings, we first need to determine the age of the older brother. Since one of the brothers is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother, the older brother's age is 12 * 2 = 24 years.

Now, we know that all the sisters are 16 years old. There are 3 sisters, so their total age is 16 * 3 = 48 years.

The total age of the brothers is 12 (younger brother) + 24 (older brother) = 36 years.

To find the total age of all the siblings, we add the total age of the brothers and the total age of the sisters: 36 (brothers) + 48 (sisters) = 84 years.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity separately and then add them together.

Meditation time per day: 15 minutes (morning) + 15 minutes (night) = 30 minutes
Since Charisma meditates 7 days a week, the total meditation time per week is: 30 minutes/day * 7 days/week = 210 minutes/week

Yoga time per day: 1 hour = 60 minutes
Since Charisma practices yoga 5 days a week, the total yoga time per week is: 60 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 300 minutes/week

Total time spent on meditation and yoga per week: 210 minutes/week (meditation) + 300 minutes/week (yoga) = 510 minutes/week

In 4 weeks, the total time spent on meditation and yoga is: 510 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 2040 minutes

"To find the total number of seeds, we first need to determine the number of seeds in a large sunflower. 

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, a small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5, which equals 18. 

Now, we add the 50% more seeds to the original 36 seeds: 36 + 18 = 54 seeds in a large sunflower.

To find the total number of seeds, we add the seeds from the small sunflower and the large sunflower: 36 + 54 = 90 seeds.

The total number of sunflower seeds is 90."
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

We know that George has 18 pens. 

Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, we can calculate Timothy's pens as follows:
Timothy's pens = 3 * George's pens
Timothy's pens = 3 * 18
Timothy's pens = 54

Now, we know that Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy. We can calculate Sarah's pens as follows:
Sarah's pens = 0.5 * Timothy's pens
Sarah's pens = 0.5 * 54
Sarah's pens = 27

"To find out how much money the company will receive for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks and then multiply it by the price per bar.

First, let's find out how many bars the company produces in one week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the company produces 5000 bars/day * 7 days/week = 35,000 bars/week.

Now, we need to find out how many bars the company produces in two weeks. 35,000 bars/week * 2 weeks = 70,000 bars.

Since each bar is sold for $2, the total amount of money the company will receive is 70,000 bars * $2/bar = $140,000.

"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, the total cost of the T-shirts would be 2 * $8 = $16. However, since there's a buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake only pays for one T-shirt at the original price and the other one at 50% off. So, the cost of the first T-shirt is $8 and the cost of the second T-shirt is $8 * 0.5 = $4. The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and Jake gets a 40% discount. The discount amount is $40 * 0.4 = $16. So, the cost of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store. The total cost is $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ryan earns $6 each week he completes his chores, and he did his chores for 3 weeks. So, his total earnings are 6 * 3 = $18.

He then spent $1.25 each on ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, which is a total of 4 cones. The total cost of the ice cream cones is 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, let's subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from his total earnings: $18 - $5 = $13.

The movie tickets cost $6.50 each, and Ryan wants to buy tickets for himself and his 3 friends, which is a total of 4 tickets. To find out how many tickets he can buy, we need to divide the remaining amount by the cost of one ticket: $13 / $6.50 = 2.

So, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets.

"To find the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars, we first need to calculate the cost of making one jar and then multiply it by 10.

The cost of making one jar of the mixture is the sum of the costs of the ingredients:
- 2 pounds of passion fruit at $6 per pound: 2 * $6 = $12
- 1.5 pounds of jackfruit at $8 per pound: 1.5 * $8 = $12
- 2 pounds of honey at $10 per pound: 2 * $10 = $20
Total cost of making one jar: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Now, we need to find the total cost of making 10 jars:
$44 * 10 = $440

The selling price of one jar is $50, so the total revenue from selling 10 jars is:
$50 * 10 = $500

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
$500 - $440 = $60

The profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars is $60."
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add them together.

A quarter is worth $0.25, so 32 quarters are worth 32 x $0.25 = $8.

A dime is worth $0.10, so 95 dimes are worth 95 x $0.10 = $9.50.

A nickel is worth $0.05, so 120 nickels are worth 120 x $0.05 = $6.

A penny is worth $0.01, so 750 pennies are worth 750 x $0.01 = $7.50.

Initially, Randy has 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. 

He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. So, he now has:
- 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies
- 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies

Then, he ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. So, he now has:
- 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies (no change)
- 4 sugar cookies (no change)

He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. So, he now has:
- 6 oatmeal cookies (no change)
- 3 chocolate chip cookies (no change)
- 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies

Then, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. So, he now has:
- 6 + 4 = 10 oatmeal cookies
- 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies
- 2 + 4 = 6 sugar cookies

Now, let's count the total number of cookies Randy has:

"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the amount he would get for the first half of the collection and the second half separately, and then add them together.

Since Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, we can divide them into two equal halves: 6 toy soldiers for the first half and 6 toy soldiers for the second half.

For the first half, Matthew would get $5 per toy, so the total amount for the first half would be 6 * $5 = $30.

For the second half, Matthew would get $7 per toy, so the total amount for the second half would be 6 * $7 = $42.

To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we add the amounts for the first and second halves together: $30 + $42 = $72.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then find out how many holes Nate fills in per day. 

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled in per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes.

To find out how many days it takes to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled in per day: 84 / 3 = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the number of weeks by dividing the total number of days by 7: 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws needed for the tables and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws, so each table needs 4 x 2 = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is 8 x 4 = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, so to find out how many he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

"Let's break down the information given. We know that Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, but Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron. This means that if Aaron runs a certain distance in a certain time, Vanessa will run twice that distance in the same time.

Let's denote the time it takes Aaron to run 1 mile as 't'. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, the time it takes Vanessa to run 1 mile is 2t.

We are given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, and since he runs twice as fast as Vanessa, the distance he ran is half of the distance Vanessa ran. Vanessa ran 4 miles, so Aaron ran 4/2 = 2 miles.

Since Aaron runs 2 miles in 16 minutes, the time it takes him to run 1 mile is 16/2 = 8 minutes. This means that t = 8 minutes.

Now, we know that Vanessa runs 2t miles in the same time it takes Aaron to run 1 mile. Since t = 8 minutes, Vanessa runs 2t = 2 * 8 = 16 minutes to run 2 miles. 

Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, the total time it took her to complete her part of the race is 16 * 2 = 32 minutes.

First, let's calculate their daily revenue. They get 6 reservations a night, and each reservation includes 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine. 

Daily revenue = (6 reservations * 2 meals * $5) + (6 reservations * $5)
Daily revenue = (6 * 2 * $5) + (6 * $5)
Daily revenue = $60 + $30
Daily revenue = $90

2. James is now twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. This means that Dora is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.
3. Since James is twice as old as Dora, James is 2 * 9 = 18 years old.
4. We know that James is 18 years old now, and he was born when John was 19. This means that John is currently 19 + (18) = 37 years old.
5. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

"To find out how much Mark paid, we first need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original price of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it for 80% off. 

80% off means he pays 20% of the original price. To find 20% of $400, we multiply $400 by 0.20. 

$400 * 0.20 = $80

So, Mark pays $80 for the radiator. 

Next, we need to calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic works for 3 hours at $50 an hour. 

$50 * 3 = $150

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of hiring the mechanic to find the total amount Mark paid.

$80 (radiator) + $150 (mechanic) = $230

"Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation C + W = 20.

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. Therefore, we can write the equation 2C + 4W = 70.

We can solve the first equation for W: W = 20 - C.

Now, substitute W = 20 - C into the second equation: 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70.

Expand the equation: 2C + 80 - 4C = 70.

Combine like terms: -2C + 80 = 70.

Subtract 80 from both sides: -2C = -10.

Divide both sides by -2: C = 5.

The number of chickens is 5.
