"Let's break it down step by step. 

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and bakes 4 for her friends. So, she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs for breakfast and baking. 

Now, let's find out how many eggs she has left. 16 (total eggs) - 7 (eggs used) = 9 eggs left.

She sells these 9 eggs at $2 each. So, she makes 9 x 2 = $18 every day at the farmers' market.

"To find out how many bolts of white fiber it takes, we need to find half of 2 bolts of blue fiber. Half of 2 is 1. 

So, it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and 1 bolt of white fiber. 

To find the total number of bolts, we add 2 and 1. 

2 + 1 = 3

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit Josh made, we need to first find the total value of the house after the repairs. 

The house was originally $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

To find 150% of $80,000, we multiply $80,000 by 1.5 (since 100% + 50% = 150%). 

$80,000 x 1.5 = $120,000

So the total value of the house after the repairs is $120,000. 

Now, we need to find the total amount Josh spent on the house. He bought the house for $80,000 and put in $50,000 in repairs. 

$80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

The profit Josh made is the difference between the total value of the house after the repairs and the total amount he spent on the house.

$120,000 - $130,000 = -$10,000

Josh actually lost $10,000.

The final answer is: -$10,000"
"To find out how many meters James runs in a week, we need to first find out how many meters he runs in one week of sprints. 

James runs 3 sprints a day, and he does this 3 times a week. So, he runs a total of 3 * 3 = 9 sprints a week.

Since each sprint is 60 meters, we multiply the number of sprints by the distance of each sprint: 9 * 60 = 540 meters.

So, James runs 540 meters a week."
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we need to know how many cups of feed she gives in total and divide it by 3 meals. 

First, let's find out how many cups of feed Wendi gives in total. She gives 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. So, 15 + 25 = 40 cups. 

Now, we need to divide the total cups of feed by 3 meals. 40 cups / 3 meals = 13.33 cups per meal. 

Since Wendi feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed, and she has 20 chickens, she gives 3 * 20 = 60 cups of feed in total per day. 

Now, we can divide the total cups of feed by 3 meals. 60 cups / 3 meals = 20 cups per meal.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break it down. One glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5. To find 60% of $5, we multiply 5 by 0.6. 

5 * 0.6 = $3

So, the second glass costs $3. Now, we need to find the total cost of 16 glasses. We can do this by adding the cost of the first glass and the cost of the second glass, and then multiply by the number of second glasses Kylar wants to buy.

Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. The first glass costs $5, and the second glass costs $3. There are 8 second glasses in 16 glasses (since every second glass is a second glass). 

The total cost of the first glass is $5. The total cost of the second glasses is 8 * $3 = $24. 

Now, we add the cost of the first glass and the cost of the second glasses. 

$5 + $24 = $29

So, Kylar needs to pay $29 for the first glass and $24 for the second glasses. To find the total cost, we add these two amounts together.

$29 + $24 = $53

The final answer is: $53"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Seattle has 20 sheep. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 x 20 = 80 sheep. 

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 x 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, let's add up the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle: 160 + 80 + 20 = 260.

The final answer is: 260"
"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to find out how long it takes to download the first 40% of the file, add the time it takes to install the updates, and then add the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file.

First, let's find out how long it takes to download 40% of the file. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 x 200 = 80 GB. Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, it will take her 80 / 2 = 40 minutes to download 40% of the file.

Then, it takes 20 minutes to install the updates.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file. 60% of 200 GB is 0.6 x 200 = 120 GB. It will take Carla 120 / 2 = 60 minutes to download the remaining 60% of the file.

So, the total time it takes to download the file is 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how far John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in each part of his trip and then add them up.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. Distance = speed * time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

Then, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move at all during this time.

Next, he drives for half an hour at 30 mph. Distance = speed * time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.

Finally, he drives for the remaining 2 hours at 80 mph. Distance = speed * time = 80 * 2 = 160 miles.

Now, let's add up the distances: 180 + 0 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles.

John is 355 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours."
"To find Eliza's earnings for this week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours. 

First, let's find her earnings for the first 40 hours. Her rate per hour is $10, so her earnings for 40 hours will be 40 x $10 = $400.

Now, let's find her earnings for the overtime hours. She worked 45 hours in total, so the overtime hours are 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime pay is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, which is 1.2 x $10 = $12 per hour. So, her earnings for the overtime hours will be 5 x $12 = $60.

Now, let's add her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours to find her total earnings. $400 + $60 = $460.

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and add them up.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month. So, the second month downloads = 3 * 60 = 180.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3. 180 * 0.3 = 54. So, the third month downloads = 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, let's add up the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the donuts. 3 dozen donuts cost $68 per dozen, so 3 x $68 = $204.

Next, let's find the cost of the mini cupcakes. 2 dozen mini cupcakes cost $80 per dozen, so 2 x $80 = $160.

Now, let's find the cost of the mini cheesecakes. 6 dozen mini cheesecakes cost $55 per dozen, so 6 x $55 = $330.

Now, we add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The final answer is: $694"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much money Carlos will make in a year from selling lemons. He gets 7 lemons per year and sells each lemon for $1.5. 

7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5 per year

Now, we need to subtract the cost of taking care of the tree, which is $3 per year. 

$10.5 per year - $3 per year = $7.5 per year profit

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for the tree to pay for itself. The tree costs $90 to plant. 

We need to divide the cost of the tree by the profit per year. 

$90 / $7.5 per year = 12 years

So, it will take 12 years for the tree to pay for itself and start earning money.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. If we say she started with x vacuum cleaners, then she sold x/3 at the green house. 

Now, she has x - x/3 vacuum cleaners left. To simplify this, we can multiply x by 3 and then subtract x, which is the same as subtracting x/3. So, she has 3x - x = 2x vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, she has 2x - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Next, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. Half of 2x - 2 is (2x - 2)/2 = x - 1. So, she has 2x - 2 - (x - 1) = x - 1 vacuum cleaners left.

We know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation x - 1 = 5. 

To solve for x, we add 1 to both sides of the equation. x = 5 + 1 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"First, let's find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. 20% of 20 students is 0.2 x 20 = 4 students.

Now, we have 20 - 4 = 16 students left. 25% of 16 students is 0.25 x 16 = 4 students.

So, the number of students left for hip-hop dance is 16 - 4 = 12 students.

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100. 

12 / 20 = 0.6
0.6 x 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the profit, we need to calculate the increase in value of each item. 

For the jewelry, the increase in value is 2.5% of $5,000, which is 0.025 x 5000 = $125. 

For the electronic gadgets, the increase in value is 1.2% of $8,000, which is 0.012 x 8000 = $96.

The merchant will choose the jewelry because it has a higher increase in value. 

The profit will be the increase in value of the chosen item, which is $125."
"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they're traveling in the same direction, they both cover the same distance, which is 80 miles.

The next day, they travel northward, covering 150 miles. Again, since they're traveling in the same direction, they both cover the same distance, which is 150 miles.

So, the total distance covered by each train in the two days is 80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate how much she earns from teaching and coaching separately, then add them together.

First, let's calculate how much Jill earns from teaching. She works 35 hours a week for 50 weeks a year. 

35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year

Since she gets paid $20 per hour, we multiply the total hours by her hourly wage.

1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Now, let's calculate how much Jill earns from coaching. She works 15 hours a week for 50 weeks a year.

15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year

Since she gets paid $30 per hour, we multiply the total hours by her hourly wage.

750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, we add the amount she earns from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary.

$35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To find out how many eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to know how many days are in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks is 4 x 7 = 28 days.

Since Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. To find out how many eggs she eats in 28 days, we multiply 3 eggs per day by 28 days: 3 x 28 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks: 84 / 12 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we need to first find the total time she has to walk the remaining distance. 

She has already walked 4 miles in 1 hour and 2 miles in another hour, so she has walked 6 miles in 2 hours. 

The total distance is 12 miles, and she has already walked 6 miles, so she has 12 - 6 = 6 miles left to walk.

Since she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, and she has 6 miles left to walk, she needs to walk these 6 miles in 6 / 4 = 1.5 hours.

The speed she needs to walk the remaining distance is 6 miles / 1.5 hours = 4 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much water is in the remaining 24 liters, we need to find out how much water is in the orange drink and the pineapple drink separately, then add them together and subtract the water from the spilled drink.

First, let's find out how much water is in the orange drink. Since it's two-thirds water, we multiply 10 liters by 2/3.

10 liters * 2/3 = 20/3 liters of water in the orange drink.

Now, let's find out how much water is in the pineapple drink. Since it's three-fifths water, we multiply 15 liters by 3/5.

15 liters * 3/5 = 45/5 liters of water in the pineapple drink.

Now, let's find out how much water is in the spilled drink. Since it's two-thirds water, we multiply 1 liter by 2/3.

1 liter * 2/3 = 2/3 liters of water in the spilled drink.

Now, let's add the water from the orange drink, pineapple drink, and subtract the water from the spilled drink.

(20/3 + 45/5) - 2/3 = (20/3 + 45/5) - 2/3

To add 20/3 and 45/5, we need to find a common denominator, which is 15.

(20/3) * (5/5) = 100/15
(45/5) * (3/3) = 135/15

Now, we can add them together.

(100/15 + 135/15) = 235/15

Now, let's subtract 2/3 from 235/15. To do this, we need to find a common denominator, which is 15.

(2/3) * (5/5) = 10/15

Now, we can subtract 10/15 from 235/15.

235/15 - 10/15 = 225/15

Now, we can simplify 225/15 by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 15.

225/15 = 15

So, the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 15 liters.

15"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that Samantha is 31 years old now. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we can find out how old Raymond is by adding 6 to Samantha's age. 

Raymond's age = Samantha's age + 6
Raymond's age = 31 + 6
Raymond's age = 37

We also know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we need to subtract 23 from Raymond's current age.

Years ago Raymond's son was born = Raymond's current age - 23
Years ago Raymond's son was born = 37 - 23
Years ago Raymond's son was born = 14

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, Billy's first 3 customers buy one DVD each, so that's 3 x 1 = 3 DVDs. 

Then, his next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs. 

Now, we add the DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers, which is 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs. 

The last 3 customers don't buy any DVDs, so we don't need to add anything to the total. 

So, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"To find out how many centimeters shorter the candle will be, we need to know how many hours it burns. 

The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. That's 4 hours. 

Since the candle melts 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply 2 centimeters by 4 hours. 

2 centimeters/hour * 4 hours = 8 centimeters

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to figure out what 100% of the price is, since the 25% discount is a part of the original price. 

If 25% is $19.50, then we need to find 100% (or the whole). To do this, we can use a simple math trick. 

First, we need to find out what 1% is. We can do this by dividing $19.50 by 25 (since 25% is the same as 25/100 or 1/4). 

$19.50 ÷ 25 = $0.78

Now that we know 1% is $0.78, we can find 100% by multiplying $0.78 by 100.

$0.78 × 100 = $78

So, the original price of the book was $78.

The final answer is: $78"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much Marie spent on the chicken meal, milk, and apples. 

The chicken meal costs $12. 
5 packs of milk cost $3 each, so 5 x $3 = $15. 
4 apples cost $1.50 each, so 4 x $1.50 = $6. 

Now, let's add up the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples. 
$12 + $15 + $6 = $33. 

Marie paid a total of $50, and she spent $33 on the chicken meal, milk, and apples. So, the amount she spent on pizza is $50 - $33 = $17. 

Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so to find out how many boxes Marie ordered, we need to divide the total amount she spent on pizza by the cost of each box. 
$17 ÷ $8.50 = 2. 

The final answer is: 2"

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to know how many cartons she buys and how much each carton costs. 

Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, and there are 15 servings in a carton. So, she will need 15 servings per day. 

Since there are 30 days in a month, in 60 days, there will be 2 months. 

In 2 months, she will need 15 servings per day * 60 days = 900 servings. 

Since there are 15 servings in a carton, she will need 900 servings / 15 servings per carton = 60 cartons. 

Each carton costs $4.00, so she will spend 60 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $240.00.

The final answer is: $240.00"
"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to know the distance between the two stops. 

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip was 60 miles, we can find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip by subtracting 15 miles from 60 miles. 

60 miles - 15 miles = 45 miles

Now, we know the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip. To find the distance between the first and second stops, we need to subtract the distance of the first stop from the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip. 

45 miles - 20 miles = 25 miles

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

We know that one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much. So, the other pair of heels costs 2 x 33 = $66.

We also know that the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. Let's call the cost of the boots ""x"". So, the equation would be: 33 + 66 = x - 5.

Now, let's solve for x. First, we add 33 and 66: 33 + 66 = 99. Now, we have 99 = x - 5.

To solve for x, we need to add 5 to both sides of the equation: 99 + 5 = x. This simplifies to 104 = x.

So, the boots cost $104.

The final answer is: $104"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Let Darrell's age be 7x and Allen's age be 11x. 

Since their total age is 162, we can write the equation: 7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Darrell's and Allen's current ages. Darrell's age is 7x = 7(9) = 63. Allen's age is 11x = 11(9) = 99.

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109.

"Let's break it down step by step.

The first friend says 80 jelly beans. 

The second friend says 20 more than half of 80, which is 40. So, the second friend says 40 + 20 = 60 jelly beans.

The third friend says 25% more than 80, which is 80 + (25% of 80). To find 25% of 80, we multiply 80 by 0.25 (since 25% is the same as 0.25). 80 * 0.25 = 20. So, the third friend says 80 + 20 = 100 jelly beans.

Now, we have three guesses: 80, 60, and 100. To find the average, we add them up and divide by 3. 

80 + 60 + 100 = 240

240 / 3 = 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To find out how many hours John spends taking care of dogs in a week, we need to multiply the number of hours he spends per day with each dog by the number of days in a week and then multiply that by the number of dogs.

First, let's find out how many hours he spends per day with all the dogs. He has 10 dogs and each dog takes 0.5 hours a day, so:

10 dogs * 0.5 hours/day = 5 hours/day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the hours per day by 7:

5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

So, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of dogs.

35"
"Let's say the number of silver coins is x. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30.

We know that the total number of coins is 110, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40

So, the number of silver coins is 40. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is 40 + 30 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"

Next, we need to find out how many jewels Aaron has. It's given that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Half of Raymond's jewels is 40 / 2 = 20. 

So, Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Now, we know Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to subtract 2 from Aaron's jewels. 

Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

25% of 4 points is 0.25 x 4 = 1 point. 

So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we need to add the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes. 

4 points (first 20 minutes) + 5 points (second 20 minutes) = 9 points.

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to first find out how much he spends on yogurt per day. 

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. They are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00. To find the price of 1 yogurt, we need to divide $5.00 by 4 yogurts. 

$5.00 ÷ 4 yogurts = $1.25 per yogurt

Now, we know that Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, and each yogurt costs $1.25. To find out how much he spends on yogurt per day, we multiply the number of yogurts he eats by the price of each yogurt.

2 yogurts/day * $1.25/yogurt = $2.50/day

Now, we need to find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days. We multiply the amount he spends per day by the number of days.

$2.50/day * 30 days = $75.00

"Let's break it down step by step. 

John sells 13 lego sets for $15 each. To find out how much money he made, we multiply the number of sets by the price of each set: 13 * 15 = 195 dollars.

He then buys 8 video games for $20 each. To find out how much money he spent, we multiply the number of games by the price of each game: 8 * 20 = 160 dollars.

He had $5 left after buying the video games. This means he had 195 - 160 = 35 dollars left after buying the video games.

Since he had 35 dollars left after buying the video games, and he had 195 dollars before buying the video games, he must have spent 195 - 35 = 160 dollars on the video games.

We already know he spent 160 dollars on 8 video games. Now we need to find out how many sets he sold to get 160 dollars. We know each set is worth 15 dollars, so we divide 160 by 15 to find out how many sets he sold: 160 / 15 = 10.67. 

Since you can't sell a fraction of a set, we round down to 10 sets. This means he sold 13 - 10 = 3 sets."
"To find out how fast John runs, we need to find out how many miles he runs per hour. 

First, let's find out how many miles he runs in a day. He runs 3 hours the first day, and half as much on the other two days. Half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours. So, he runs 3 hours on the first day and 1.5 hours on each of the other two days. 

Total hours he runs in a week is 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours.

He runs 60 miles in a week. To find out how many miles he runs per hour, we need to divide the total miles by the total hours. 

60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour. Since she can skip at a rate that is half as fast as she can run, we can find her running speed by multiplying her skipping speed by 2. 

Her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

We also know that Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. So, we can find her walking speed by dividing her running speed by 4.

Her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, we know she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, in 6 hours, she will spend 2 hours running and 4 hours walking.

To find the total distance she can travel in 6 hours, we need to multiply the time she spends running by her running speed and the time she spends walking by her walking speed, then add the two distances together.

Distance running = 2 hours * 6 miles per hour = 12 miles
Distance walking = 4 hours * 1.5 miles per hour = 6 miles

Total distance = 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. 
Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, so Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old. 
Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, so Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how far outside of the dragon's flames Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we need to find out how far she can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone. 

When Polly holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. Since she can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, she can throw it 3 * 400 = 1200 feet with the gemstone.

The dragon's flames reach 1000 feet. To find out how far outside of the flames Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we need to subtract the distance of the flames from the distance she can throw the javelin. 

So, 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

The final answer is: 200"
"Let's break it down step by step. Grandma Jones baked 5 pies and cut each pie into 8 pieces. So, the total number of pie pieces is 5 x 8 = 40. 

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. This means that the guests took 40 - 14 = 26 pieces of pie. 

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how many calories you can still eat, we need to subtract the calories you've already consumed from your daily target. 

2000 (daily target) - 1800 (already consumed) = 200 calories left

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, we need to find out how many servings you can eat with 200 calories.

200 (calories left) / 250 (calories per serving) = 0.8 servings

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, we need to find out how many grams are in 0.8 servings.

0.8 (servings) / 5 (total servings) = 0.16 (or 16%) of the bag

Now, we need to find 16% of 300g.

16% of 300g = 0.16 * 300g = 48g

So, you can eat 48g of chips."
"To find the net profit, we need to first find the cost and the revenue. 

The cost of making 20 candles is the cost of the supplies, which is $10.00 per pound of beeswax. Since Charlie makes 10 candles per pound, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles. The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax is 2 x $10.00 = $20.00.

The revenue is the amount of money Charlie gets from selling the candles. He sells each candle for $2.00, so the revenue from selling 20 candles is 20 x $2.00 = $40.00.

The net profit is the revenue minus the cost. So, the net profit is $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To find out how many articles Meredith wrote on Tuesday, we need to calculate 2/5 times more articles than Monday. 

2/5 times more articles than Monday means 2/5 of 5 plus 5. 
2/5 of 5 is 2. 
2 + 5 is 7. 

So, Meredith wrote 7 articles on Tuesday. 

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. 
Twice 7 is 14. 

So, Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday, 7 articles on Tuesday, and 14 articles on Wednesday. 

To find the total number of articles, we add 5 + 7 + 14. 
5 + 7 + 14 is 26. 

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, we multiply the total number of articles by 4. 
26 * 4 is 104.

The final answer is: 104"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Candice started with 80 post-it notes. She used 220 post-it notes at work. To find out how many post-it notes she had left, we need to subtract the ones she used from the ones she started with. 

80 - 220 = -140 

This is a negative number, which means she doesn't have enough post-it notes to use 220. This can't be right. Let's think about it again.

Candice had 80 post-it notes initially. She bought some more, and then she had 23 post-it notes left. This means she used 80 + 23 = 103 post-it notes in total. 

Since she used 220 post-it notes at work, and she used 103 post-it notes in total, we need to find out how many post-it notes she bought. 

Let's call the number of post-it notes she bought 'x'. We can write an equation to represent this situation:

x + 80 = 103 + 220

Combine the numbers on the right side of the equation:

x + 80 = 323

Now, we need to isolate 'x'. To do this, we need to subtract 80 from both sides of the equation:

x = 323 - 80

x = 243

So, Candice bought 243 post-it notes.

The final answer is: 243"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. To find out how many blue ties he bought, we can divide the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie.

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 times the number of blue ties in red ties.

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

Now, we know the number of red ties and blue ties. We also know that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. This means the cost of each red tie is 1.5 times the cost of each blue tie.

Cost of each red tie = 1.5 * Cost of each blue tie
= 1.5 * $40
= $60

Now, we can find the total amount spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie.

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Finally, we can find the total amount spent on all ties by adding the total amount spent on blue ties and the total amount spent on red ties.

Total amount spent on all ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find out how many pieces Tracy got, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot. 

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces

So, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire.

"To find the total number of units in the building, we need to multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor. 

Number of floors: 15
Number of units per floor: 8

Total units = Number of floors * Number of units per floor
Total units = 15 * 8
Total units = 120

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total units to find the number of unoccupied units.

1/4 of the total units = (1/4) * 120
1/4 of the total units = 30

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to first find out how much he makes per day and then multiply it by 7.

Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. Since he sells them for $2 per dozen, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs he sells per day. 

There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide 252 by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs he sells per day. 

252 ÷ 12 = 21 dozen eggs per day.

Now, we multiply the number of dozens of eggs he sells per day by the price per dozen to find out how much he makes per day.

21 dozen eggs per day * $2 per dozen = $42 per day.

To find out how much he makes per week, we multiply the amount he makes per day by 7.

$42 per day * 7 days per week = $294 per week.

The final answer is: $294"
"To find out how long it takes Tom to get back, we need to know how long he was sailing from 1 to 4 PM. 

First, let's find out how long he was sailing from 1 to 4 PM. There are 3 hours from 1 to 4 PM. 

Now, we know that the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM is the same distance he will travel back. We can use the formula: distance = speed * time. 

Since we don't know the distance, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. We know the speed is 10 miles per hour, and the time is 3 hours. 

So, distance = 10 * 3 = 30 miles.

Now, we know the distance is 30 miles, and the speed is 6 miles per hour. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed.

time = 30 / 6 = 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

Uriah has 30 comic books, and each comic book weighs 1/4 pound. To find the total weight of the comic books, we multiply the number of comic books by the weight of each comic book.

30 comic books * 1/4 pound per comic book = 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds

Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total. Since the comic books already weigh 7.5 pounds, we subtract this from the total weight he needs to remove.

15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds left to remove

Now, we know that each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy.

7.5 pounds / 0.5 pounds per toy = 15 toys

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

"To find the revenue earned on Thursday, we need to multiply the number of truck tires by the price per truck tire and add the number of car tires by the price per car tire. 

Revenue on Thursday = (6 * $60) + (4 * $40)
Revenue on Thursday = $360 + $160
Revenue on Thursday = $520

To find the revenue earned on Friday, we need to multiply the number of car tires by the price per car tire.

Revenue on Friday = (12 * $40)
Revenue on Friday = $480

Now, we need to compare the revenues of Thursday and Friday to find the day with higher revenue. 

Thursday's revenue is $520 and Friday's revenue is $480. Thursday has higher revenue.

To find how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to subtract the revenue of the day with lower revenue from the revenue of the day with higher revenue.

Difference in revenue = $520 - $480
Difference in revenue = $40

The final answer is: $40"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that the Doubtfire sisters have 7 kittens from the animal shelter. 

Then, their mother says that Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens. Since they adopted 7 kittens, thrice that number would be 3 x 7 = 21. 

Trixie has had 12 kittens. 

So, the total number of kittens now is 7 (adopted) + 21 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 40.

5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Now, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each box:
1245 / 15 = 83

So, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 83.

The final answer is: 83"
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to follow the order of operations. 

First, we need to find the total cost of the groceries before the delivery fee and tip. We know that the delivery vendor added a 25% fee to the final total, and then added a $3.00 delivery fee. 

Let's call the original price of the groceries ""x"". The 25% fee is 0.25x. The total cost before the tip is x + 0.25x + 3.00. 

The total cost before the tip is 1.25x + 3.00. 

We know that the final bill was $40.00, and Stephen added a $4.00 tip. So, the total cost before the tip is 40.00 - 4.00 = 36.00.

Now we can set up the equation: 1.25x + 3.00 = 36.00

To solve for x, we need to subtract 3.00 from both sides of the equation: 1.25x = 33.00

Now, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 1.25 to find x: x = 33.00 / 1.25
x = 26.40

So, the original price of the groceries was $26.40. 

The final price of Stephen's groceries is the original price plus the delivery fee and tip: 26.40 + 3.00 + 4.00 = 33.40

The final answer is: $33.40"

There are 2 sour oranges. 

So, the total number of oranges that are not good is 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 oranges. 

Now, to find the number of good oranges, we subtract the number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges. 
25 - 8 = 17 oranges.

Then, we need to find 10% of $1300. To do that, we multiply $1300 by 0.1 (since 10% is the same as 0.1). 

$1300 * 0.1 = $130.

Now, we add the insurance cost to the total cost: $1300 + $130 = $1430.

So, Janet paid $1430.

"To find Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to calculate the value of the pension after 30 years and then add 5% of that value.

Marcy works for 30 years, but she only gets the 5% increase after 20 years. So, for the first 20 years, she gets $50,000 per year. 

For the next 10 years (30 - 20 = 10), she gets 5% more than $50,000 per year. 

5% of $50,000 is $2,500. 

So, for the last 10 years, Marcy gets $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500 per year.

To find the total value of the pension after 30 years, we multiply the annual pension for the first 20 years by 20 and the annual pension for the last 10 years by 10.

Total value of the pension after 30 years = ($50,000 * 20) + ($52,500 * 10)
= $1,000,000 + $525,000
= $1,525,000

Now, we need to find 5% of the total value of the pension after 30 years to get the additional amount she gets after 20 years.

5% of $1,525,000 = $76,250

Now, we add this to the annual pension for the last 10 years to get Marcy's annual pension after 30 years.

Marcy's annual pension after 30 years = $52,500 + $76,250
= $128,750

First, we know there are 175 diamonds. 

Then, we know there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. So, the number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140.

Next, we know there are twice the number of emeralds as rubies. So, the number of emeralds is 2 x 140 = 280.

Now, we need to find the total number of gems. To do that, we add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds together. 

175 (diamonds) + 140 (rubies) + 280 (emeralds) = 595

"Let's break it down step by step. Bailey starts with a certain amount of money, let's call it x. 

She receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so she gets 5 * 8 = $40 from her allowance.

At the end of 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. This means that the money she started with (x) plus the money she got from her allowance ($40) equals $100.

So, we can write an equation: x + 40 = 100.

To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to solve for x. We can do this by subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation.

x = 100 - 40
x = 60

So, Bailey started with $60.

"To find out how much Shiela will pay each month, we need to first calculate the total cost of the cell phones with the interest. 

The cost of 5 cell phones is $150 each, so the total cost is 5 x $150 = $750.

A 2% interest will be charged for each unit. To find the interest, we multiply the total cost by 2% (or 0.02). 

Interest = $750 x 0.02 = $15.

Now, we add the interest to the total cost to get the total amount Shiela needs to pay. 

Total amount = $750 + $15 = $765.

Since Shiela will pay this amount over 3 months, we need to divide the total amount by 3 to find out how much she will pay each month.

$765 ÷ 3 = $255.

So, Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months.

"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year. 

First, let's find out how many days are in a year. There are 365 days in a year. 

The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food for the first 180 days. So, the puppy eats 1 cup * 180 days = 180 cups of dog food in the first 180 days.

The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of its life, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days. So, the puppy eats 2 cups * 185 days = 370 cups of dog food in the rest of the year.

Now, let's add the amount of dog food the puppy eats in the first 180 days and the rest of the year. 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we can find out how many bags Cecilia will use by dividing the total amount of dog food by the number of cups in one bag. 550 cups / 110 cups per bag = 5 bags.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

If Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, and she does 4 times as much laundry as David, then David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.

Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, then Raymond does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry.

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do. To do that, we subtract the amount David does from the amount Raymond does: 200 - 100 = 100.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 and packages of 2.

If Vincent buys 18 flowers in packages of 3, he will need 6 packages (18 / 3 = 6). The cost will be 6 x $2.50 = $15.

If Vincent buys 18 flowers in packages of 2, he will need 9 packages (18 / 2 = 9). The cost will be 9 x $1 = $9.

The better price is $9. To find the savings, we subtract the cost of the better price from the cost of the more expensive option: $15 - $9 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find the cost of the grooming, we need to first find the discount amount. 

The discount is 30% of $100. To find 30% of $100, we multiply $100 by 0.3 (since 30% is the same as 30/100 or 0.3).

$100 x 0.3 = $30

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the final cost.

$100 - $30 = $70

The final cost of the grooming is $70.

$70"
"So, two girls got 1/6 of 24 liters each. To find out how much they got, we need to multiply 24 by 1/6. 

24 * 1/6 = 4 liters. Since there are two girls, they got 4 * 2 = 8 liters in total.

Now, the boy got 6 liters. So, the total amount of water taken is 8 + 6 = 14 liters.

To find out how much water is left, we need to subtract 14 from 24.

24 - 14 = 10 liters.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break it down step by step. Charlie started with 10 stickers. 

He bought 21 stickers from the store, so now he has 10 + 21 = 31 stickers.

Then, he got 23 stickers for his birthday, so now he has 31 + 23 = 54 stickers.

After that, he gave 9 stickers to his sister, so now he has 54 - 9 = 45 stickers.

Finally, he used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so now he has 45 - 28 = 17 stickers.

So, Charlie has 17 stickers left.

"To find Alex's weight, we need to multiply Grace's weight by 4 and then subtract 2. 

First, multiply Grace's weight by 4: 125 * 4 = 500

Then, subtract 2 from that result: 500 - 2 = 498

Now, we know Alex's weight is 498 pounds. 

To find their combined weight, we need to add Grace's weight and Alex's weight: 125 + 498 = 623

The final answer is: 623"
"To find the total number of thorns, we need to multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush, and then multiply that by the number of thorns per rose.

First, we multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush: 3 * 25 = 75

Then, we multiply the result by the number of thorns per rose: 75 * 8 = 600

So, there are 600 thorns in total. 

600"
"Let's say the number of games they lost is x. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is x + 8.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so the number of games they won plus the number of games they lost is equal to 22. We can write this as an equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

So they lost 7 games. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, they won 7 + 8 = 15 games.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break this down step by step. Gene goes on 4 vacations a year and has been vacationing since he was 23 years old. To find out how many years he has been vacationing, we need to subtract his age from the current year. However, we don't know the current year, but we know he is 34. 

Since we don't know the current year, let's find the difference in years. 34 (his age) - 23 (his age when he started vacationing) = 11 years.

Now, we know he goes on 4 vacations a year. To find the total number of quilt blocks, we multiply the number of years he has been vacationing by the number of vacations he goes on each year.

11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 quilt blocks

The final answer is: 44"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times. 

The second time, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.

The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to add the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to first find her salary after 5 years of service, then find her salary after 8 years of service.

Sylvie's initial salary is $600. After 5 years, her salary will increase by 10% of $600, which is 0.1 x $600 = $60. So, her salary after 5 years will be $600 + $60 = $660.

Now, we need to find her salary after 8 years. Her salary after 5 years is $660. After 3 more years, her salary will increase by 10% of $660, which is 0.1 x $660 = $66. So, her salary after 8 years will be $660 + $66 = $726.

The final answer is: $726"
"Let's say Harald sold x copies. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn sold 10x copies. 

We know that the total number of copies sold is 88,000, so we can set up the equation: x + 10x = 88,000. 

Combine like terms: 11x = 88,000. 

Divide both sides by 11: x = 8,000.

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

"To find out how much potato salad Ted needs, we need to calculate how much an adult and a child will eat. 

An adult will eat 10 lbs of potato salad. A child will eat half as much as an adult, so a child will eat 10 / 2 = 5 lbs of potato salad.

There are 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic. To find out how much an adult will eat in total, we multiply the number of adults by the amount an adult eats: 20 * 10 = 200 lbs. To find out how much a child will eat in total, we multiply the number of children by the amount a child eats: 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

Now, we add the total amount of potato salad that adults and children will eat: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. We also know that Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald. 

So, if Lee runs 38 seconds, Gerald runs 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Now, Gerald changed his diet, which improved his speed by 10%. To find 10% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.1. 

40 * 0.1 = 4

So, Gerald's speed improved by 4 seconds. 

To find Gerald's new time, we subtract 4 from his original time. 

40 - 4 = 36

So, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know there are 60 dogs. Since there are two cats for every dog, we can find the number of cats by multiplying the number of dogs by 2. 

Number of cats = 60 * 2 = 120

Now, we know the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we need to add the number of dogs and cats first, then subtract 12.

Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180

Now, we subtract 12 from the combined number of dogs and cats to find the number of rabbits.

Number of rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 168 (rabbits) = 348

"First, we need to find out how many boys and girls there are in the class. 

Since 2/5 of the students are boys, we can find the number of boys by multiplying 2/5 by 200. 

2/5 * 200 = (2 * 200) / 5 = 400 / 5 = 80

So, there are 80 boys in the class. 

Now, we know that there are 200 students in total and 80 are boys, so the number of girls is 200 - 80 = 120.

Now, we need to find out how many girls are in the girl scout. 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, so we can find the number of girls in the girl scout by multiplying 2/3 by 120.

2/3 * 120 = (2 * 120) / 3 = 240 / 3 = 80

So, there are 80 girls in the girl scout. 

Now, we need to find out how many girls are not in the girl scout. We know that there are 120 girls in total and 80 are in the girl scout, so the number of girls not in the girl scout is 120 - 80 = 40.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know that the 16 ounce can of tomatoes loses half its volume when cooked into sauce. This means the sauce will be half the volume of the can. So, if we have a 16 ounce can, the sauce will be 8 ounces. 

Since each can of tomatoes makes 8 ounces of sauce, and we have 32 ounces of sauce, we need to find out how many cans of tomatoes Freda used. To do this, we divide 32 ounces by 8 ounces (the amount of sauce per can). 

32 ÷ 8 = 4

This means Freda used 4 cans of tomatoes. 

Now, we know each can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes. To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can.

4 cans * 3 tomatoes/can = 12 tomatoes

So, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

She will give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges, so she will give away 40 potted plants.

To find out how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we need to subtract the number of plants she gave away from the total number of plants she had. 

98 - 40 = 58

So, Mary will remain with 58 potted plants.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

To find out how many 3-mile sections there are, we divide 42 by 3. 

42 / 3 = 14

So, the city is divided into 14 sections. 

Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each section, we multiply the number of sections by the time it takes to cover each one. 

14 * 10 = 140

So, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to find the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The outer dimensions of the box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick. So, we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension to get the inner dimensions.

Inner length = 5 - 2 = 3 inches
Inner width = 6 - 2 = 4 inches
Inner height = 4 - 2 = 2 inches

Now, we can find the inner volume of one box by multiplying the inner dimensions:
Inner volume = length * width * height = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since there are 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3:
Total inner volume = 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches

However, he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the total number of cookies he actually baked is 2x + 15.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. So, we can set up the equation: 2x + 15 - 5 = 110.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 10 = 110.

The gas station is selling gas for $3.00 a gallon, and the app company is offering $.20 cashback per gallon. 

So, if someone buys 10 gallons of gas, the cashback rewards will be 10 gallons * $.20 per gallon = $2.00.

Now, we need to subtract the cashback rewards from the total cost of the gas. 

The total cost of the gas is 10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00.

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to know how many times Julia rows 10 feet in 64 seconds. 

Since it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find out how long it takes her to row 10 feet. 20 feet is 2 times 10 feet, so it takes her 2 times 16 seconds to row 20 feet. That's 32 seconds to row 20 feet. To row 10 feet, it would take her half of that time, which is 32 / 2 = 16 seconds. 

Now, we need to find out how many times 10 feet fits into 64 seconds. 64 / 16 = 4. So, Julia rows 10 feet 4 times in 64 seconds. 

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, and Julia rows 10 feet 4 times, the boat takes on 4 times 2 liters of water. That's 4 x 2 = 8 liters.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. This means if Jamal's phone can hold x photographs, then Brittany's phone can hold x/6 photographs.

We know Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. So, Brittany's phone can hold 1800/6 = 300 photographs.

The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This means if the number of birds in Jamal's photograph is y, then 300 = 50y.

To find y, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 50. So, y = 300/50 = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.

"To find the profit, we need to first find the total cost and the total selling price. 

The total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 = $100. 
The total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80. 
The total cost is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices for lumber have gone up 50%, the new price for each 2 x 4 x 10 board is $10 + ($10 * 0.5) = $15. 
The new price for each 4 x 4 x 10 board is $16 + ($16 * 0.5) = $24.

The total selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $15 = $150. 
The total selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $24 = $120. 
The total selling price is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total selling price minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

"To find out how many teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we need to know the total parts in the ratio and the fraction of the total that sugar represents. 

The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, so the total parts in the ratio is 7 + 13 = 20. 

The fraction of the total that sugar represents is 7/20. 

Since Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and water, we can set up the equation: 

(7/20) * total = 120 

To find the total, we can multiply both sides by 20/7. 

total = 120 * (20/7) 
total = 342.86 (round down to 342.86, but since we can't have a fraction of a cup, we'll use the whole number part which is 342, but since we are looking for teaspoons of sugar, we'll use the whole number part of the total which is 342, and multiply it by 7/20 to find the amount of sugar used)

amount of sugar = 342 * (7/20) 
amount of sugar = 120.9 

Since we can't have a fraction of a teaspoon, we'll round down to 120."

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 x 5 = 10.

Now, we know that the total number of vehicles on the second day is 30. To find the number of vehicles that were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container has 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers that were imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added on the second day by 5: 20 / 5 = 4.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. This means that if Adrien's salary is A, then Lylah's salary is A / 1.3 (since 100% + 30% = 130%, or 1.3 times).

We also know that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000. Since his salary increased by 40% four years later, his new salary is 40000 * 1.4 (since 100% + 40% = 140%, or 1.4 times).

Now, let's find Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up the equation:

A = 1.3L

We know that A = 40000, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

40000 = 1.3L

To find L, we can divide both sides by 1.3:

L = 40000 / 1.3
L = 30769.23

Now that we know Lylah's salary four years ago, we can find her salary four years later. Since her salary increased simultaneously with Adrien's, we can multiply her salary by 1.4:

Lylah's new salary = 30769.23 * 1.4
Lylah's new salary = 43055.72

Now, we can find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later:

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = 40000 * 1.4 + 43055.72
Total salary = 56000 + 43055.72

"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to know how many weeks are in a month. There are about 4 weeks in a month. 

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week. Since there are 30 sheets of paper in a pad, he uses 2 x 30 = 60 sheets of paper a week.

Since there are about 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the number of sheets he uses in a week by 4. 60 x 4 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. 

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, so Kael brought 2 x 5 = 10 apples. 

Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, so Kael brought 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

Now, let's count the total number of fruits they have. Morisette has 5 + 8 = 13 fruits. Kael has 10 + 4 = 14 fruits. 

In total, they have 13 + 14 = 27 fruits.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. 

For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day. 

The rest of the week is 5 days (Tuesday to Saturday). She slept 1 hour more than the 2 days before, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day for the rest of the week.

Now, let's calculate the total hours she slept for the 2 days she slept 6 hours: 6 * 2 = 12 hours.

And let's calculate the total hours she slept for the rest of the week: 7 * 5 = 35 hours.

Now, let's add the hours she slept on Monday and the hours she slept for the 2 days and the hours she slept for the rest of the week: 8 + 12 + 35 = 55 hours.

"To find out how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 3 hours and the next 4 hours.

In the first 3 hours, Rosie runs 10 miles per hour. So, we multiply 10 miles per hour by 3 hours to get the total miles she runs in the first 3 hours. 

10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles

Now, we need to find out how many miles Rosie runs in the next 4 hours at 5 miles per hour. We multiply 5 miles per hour by 4 hours.

5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 20 miles

Now, we add the miles Rosie ran in the first 3 hours to the miles she ran in the next 4 hours to get the total miles she can run in 7 hours.

30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

Jennie has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps. She puts stamps on one-third of them. To find one-third of 60, we need to divide 60 by 3. 

60 / 3 = 20

So, Jennie put stamps on 20 letters. This means that the pile of already-stamped letters increased by 20. 

We know that after Jennie put stamps on the letters, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This means that before Jennie put stamps on the letters, there were 30 - 20 = 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Julia bought a package of spoons, and then her husband gave her 5 more spoons. So, before she used any spoons, she had a total of x (the number of spoons in the package Julia bought) + 5 spoons.

Then, she used 3 spoons to sample her stew. So, the total number of spoons she had left was x + 5 - 3.

Later, when she set the table, she had 12 spoons. This means that x + 5 - 3 = 12.

To find the number of spoons in the package Julia bought, we need to solve the equation x + 5 - 3 = 12.

First, we simplify the equation: x + 2 = 12.

Then, we subtract 2 from both sides: x = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many fish sausages Dylan bought, we need to add 6 to the number of chicken sausages. 

38 (chicken sausages) + 6 = 44 (fish sausages)

50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs. Since each pepper costs $15, a watermelon costs 3 x $15 = $45.

Next, we know that an orange costs 5 dollars less than what a watermelon costs. So, an orange costs $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, we know the prices of each item: watermelon ($45), pepper ($15), and orange ($40). Dillon is buying 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges.

To find the total cost of the watermelons, we multiply the price of one watermelon by the number of watermelons: 4 x $45 = $180.

To find the total cost of the peppers, we multiply the price of one pepper by the number of peppers: 20 x $15 = $300.

To find the total cost of the oranges, we multiply the price of one orange by the number of oranges: 10 x $40 = $400.

Now, we add up the total cost of the watermelons, peppers, and oranges: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

The final answer is: $880"
"To find the profit, we need to find out how much the hospital pays the doctors and how much it gets from the patients.

First, let's find out how many hours the doctors work in a day.  There are 500 patients and each patient is seen for 24 minutes.  We need to convert 24 minutes to hours.  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours.

Now, we multiply the number of patients by the time each patient is seen: 500 * 0.4 = 200 hours.

The doctors charge $150 an hour, so the hospital pays the doctors 200 * 150 = $30,000.

Now, let's find out how much the hospital gets from the patients.  The hospital charges $200 an hour and the doctors work 200 hours, so the hospital gets 200 * 200 = $40,000.

The profit is the amount the hospital gets minus the amount it pays the doctors: $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

The final answer is: $10,000"
"To find out how many elves are left, we need to follow the steps:

1. A third of the elves quit after kids vomit on them. To find out how many elves quit, we need to divide the total number of elves by 3. 
   Total elves = 60
   Elves who quit after kids vomit = 60 / 3 = 20

2. Now, we need to subtract the elves who quit from the total number of elves to find out how many are left.
   Total elves left after kids vomit = 60 - 20 = 40

3. Then, 10 more elves quit after kids kick their shins. We need to subtract these elves from the total elves left after kids vomit.
   Elves left after kids kick their shins = 40 - 10 = 30

So, there are 30 elves left.

"To find the total expenditure, we need to add the expenditure in May and June. 

In May, Joseph spent $500. 
In June, he spent $60 less than May, so he spent $500 - $60 = $440.

The final answer is: $940"
"To find out how many tickets they used, we need to find out how many rides they did in total and then multiply it by the cost of each ride.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she rode a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides. 

Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he rode a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

Together, they rode a total of 4 + 6 = 10 rides.

Each ride costs 6 tickets, so they used 10 x 6 = 60 tickets that day.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. 
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, so he walked 4 x 6 = 24 miles on Tuesday. 

Now, we know that his total mileage from Monday to Wednesday was 41 miles. We already know that he walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday, so we can subtract those from the total to find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday. 

41 - 4 - 24 = 13 miles.

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.

"To find out how much Tom pays in a year, we need to multiply the number of car washes he gets in a month by the cost of each car wash, and then multiply that by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year).

First, we multiply the number of car washes by the cost of each car wash: 4 car washes/month * $15/car wash = $60/month

Then, we multiply the monthly cost by 12: $60/month * 12 months/year = $720/year

So, Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes."
"To find out how many video games Bobby has, we need to first find out how many video games Brian has after losing 5. 

Brian has 20 video games, but he lost 5, so he has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. To find out how many video games Bobby has, we need to multiply the number of video games Brian has by 3 and then subtract 5.

3 times 15 is 45, and 5 fewer than that is 45 - 5 = 40.

So, Bobby has 40 video games.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we need to divide 27 by 3 because one third of them are there. 

27 / 3 = 9

Now, we know that 9 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. To find out how many of them are female, we need to divide 9 by 2 because two thirds of them are female.

9 / 2 = 4.5

Since we can't have half a unicorn, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. 

4.5 is closer to 4 than 5, so we round down to 4.

The answer is 4."
"First, we need to find the total cost of the subs, chips, and cookies. 

2 subs for $7.50 each will be 2 x 7.50 = $15.00
2 bags of chips for $1.50 each will be 2 x 1.50 = $3.00
2 cookies for $1.00 each will be 2 x 1.00 = $2.00

Now, we add the cost of the subs, chips, and cookies together. 
$15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, we need to add the 20% delivery fee. 20% of $20.00 is 0.20 x 20.00 = $4.00

Now, we add the delivery fee to the total cost of the subs, chips, and cookies.
$20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, we add the $5.00 tip to the total cost.
$24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many questions Mark completed in the first test. Since he completed the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour and he had 8 hours, we multiply 5 questions per hour by 8 hours. 

5 questions/hour * 8 hours = 40 questions

Since the first test had 75 questions, we subtract the questions he completed from the total questions to find out how many he left incomplete. 

75 questions - 40 questions = 35 questions

Now, let's do the same for the second test. Mark had 6 hours to complete the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 

5 questions/hour * 6 hours = 30 questions

Since the second test had 100 questions, we subtract the questions he completed from the total questions to find out how many he left incomplete. 

100 questions - 30 questions = 70 questions

To find the total number of questions Mark left incomplete, we add the questions he left incomplete in both tests. 

35 questions + 70 questions = 105 questions

First, we know there are 12 blue gumballs. 

The problem says there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. This means we need to multiply the number of blue gumballs by 4 and then add 22.

So, we multiply 12 by 4: 12 * 4 = 48

Then we add 22: 48 + 22 = 70

So, there are 70 pink gumballs.

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to know how many semi-automatic cars there are. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 are automatic, and 4 are manual. 

First, let's find out how many semi-automatic cars there are. We can do this by subtracting the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars.

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now that we know there are 4 semi-automatic cars, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars. 

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

"Let's break it down step by step. 

There are 700 bees in total. 

Let's say the number of queens is Q. Then, the number of babies is 2Q (twice as many as queens). 

The total number of bees is the sum of queens, babies, and worker bees. So, we can write an equation: Q + 2Q + W = 700, where W is the number of worker bees.

We also know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees. So, W = 2 * 2Q = 4Q.

Now, we can substitute W in the first equation: Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700.

Combine like terms: 7Q = 700.

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100.

Now that we know Q, we can find W: W = 4Q = 4 * 100 = 400.

So, there are 400 worker bees.

Jordan works 2 hours a day and earns $10 an hour. So, in one day, he would earn 2 hours * $10/hour = $20.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the amount he earns in one day by 7. 

$20/day * 7 days = $140.

So, Jordan would earn $140 in one week if he spent his video game time working instead.

"To find the total cost, we need to add up the cost of all the items. 

First, let's add up the cost of the non-food items: 
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars
Total non-food items cost: 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Since there's a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount:
Tax = 10% of 10 dollars
Tax = 0.1 * 10
Tax = 1 dollar

Now, let's add the tax to the non-food items cost:
Total non-food items cost with tax: 10 + 1 = 11 dollars

Now, let's add up the cost of the food items:
- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars
Total food items cost: 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Now, let's add the cost of the food items and the non-food items with tax:
Total cost: 5 + 11 = 16 dollars

"To find the total income, we need to know how many clients Kim has. He already has 3 clients and is talking to 5 more, so he will have 3 + 5 = 8 clients. 

Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. So, for 8 clients, he will need 8 * 2 = 16 bottles of bleach and 8 * 1 = 8 packs of cloths.

The cost of bleach is $2 each, so 16 bottles will cost 16 * $2 = $32. The cost of cloths is $5 each, so 8 packs will cost 8 * $5 = $40.

Total expenses are $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72. 

His total income is $92. 

Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, so profit = total income - total expenses = $92 - $72 = $20.

"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest in a year, we need to first find out how many pineapples he has in total. 

John has 10 hectares of a pineapple field and there are 100 pineapples per hectare. So, we multiply the number of hectares by the number of pineapples per hectare.

10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples

Now, we know John has 1000 pineapples. He can harvest his pineapples every 3 months. There are 4 quarters in a year, so John can harvest his pineapples 4 times in a year.

1000 pineapples / 4 harvests = 250 pineapples per harvest

So, John can harvest 250 pineapples in each harvest. 

To find the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year, we multiply the number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests.

250 pineapples/harvest * 4 harvests/year = 1000 pineapples/year

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. Then, 1/2 of that many bees return in the next 6 hours. So, 1/2 of 30 is 15 bees. 

So, after the first 12 hours, 30 bees left and 15 bees returned. That means 30 - 15 = 15 bees are still out.

In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the first 30 leave the hive. So, 2 x 30 = 60 bees leave the hive. 

Now, we know that every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the next 6 hours. That means all 15 bees that were still out return to the hive.

So, in the last 6 hours, 15 bees return to the hive.

"To find out who will win the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home.

Steve lives 3 miles from the school. Since there are 5280 feet in a mile, we can convert 3 miles to feet: 3 x 5280 = 15840 feet.

Steve can bike at 440 feet per minute. To find out how long it takes him to get home, we can divide the total distance by his speed: 15840 / 440 = 36 minutes.

Tim lives 2 miles from the school. We can convert 2 miles to feet: 2 x 5280 = 10560 feet.

Tim can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute. To find out how long it takes him to get home, we can divide the total distance by his speed: 10560 / 264 = 40 minutes.

Since Steve takes 36 minutes to get home and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will win the race. To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to subtract the time it takes the winner to get home from the time it takes the loser to get home: 40 - 36 = 4 minutes.

Dave ate 14 french fries. The seagull ate half of that, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries. 

Now, there are 14 - 7 = 7 french fries left. 

Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 french fries. 

Now, there are 7 - 9 = -2 french fries left. But we can't have a negative number of fries, so let's recheck the math. The pigeons ate 9 fries, but there were only 7 fries left. This means there were not enough fries for the pigeons to eat 9. The pigeons must have eaten 7 fries, because that's all that was left. 

Now, there are 7 - 7 = 0 french fries left. 

A raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, but there are no fries left, so the raccoon stole 0 fries. 

Ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 0 - 1 = -1 french fries. But we can't have a negative number of fries, so let's recheck the math. The ants carried off 1 fry, but there were 0 fries left. This means there was 1 fry left, and the ants carried it off. 

So, there were 1 + 7 + 7 + 14 = 19 french fries in the pack when Dave bought it.

"Let's break it down. 

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes each day. Since each class is 1 hour, he spends 3 hours each day on these days. There are 3 days in a week when he has 3 classes, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes each day. Since each class is 2 hours, he spends 4 hours each day on these days. There are 2 days in a week when he has 2 classes, so that's 2 * 4 = 8 hours per week.

Now, let's add the hours he spends on both types of days. 9 hours per week + 8 hours per week = 17 hours per week.

Next, let's find the total length of the croissants. There are 120 croissants, and each croissant is 6 inches long. So, the total length of the croissants is 120 x 6 = 720 inches.

Now, let's find the total length of the baguettes. There are 60 baguettes, and each baguette is 2 feet long. Since we need to find the total length in feet, we can directly add the lengths of the baguettes. 60 x 2 = 120 feet.

Now, let's add up the lengths of all the baked goods. 1200 inches + 720 inches + 120 feet. We need to convert the inches to feet to add them together. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 1200 inches is 1200 / 12 = 100 feet, and 720 inches is 720 / 12 = 60 feet. Now, we can add them together: 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet.

"To find out who runs farther, we need to calculate how far each person runs. 

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he runs back and forth, we multiply the distance by 2. So, Blake runs 15 x 2 x 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 100 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards. She does this 34 times. So, Kelly runs 100 + 80 = 180 yards for one round. She does this 34 times, so Kelly runs 180 x 34 = 6120 yards.

Now, we need to find out who runs farther. Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 6120 yards. Kelly runs farther than Blake.

To find out how much farther Kelly runs than Blake, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance. 6120 - 3000 = 3120 yards.

Now, let's add the cost of the bond paper: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34

So, Raphael spent $34 on everything.

The final answer is: $34"
"Finn initially sees 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 more come out from under the lily pad, so he sees 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles. After that, 2 of them hide under a rock, so we need to subtract 2 from 17. 

17 - 2 = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the depth of the water on Wednesday, we need to first find the depth of the water on Tuesday. 

The depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet. On Tuesday, it had 7 feet more water, so we add 7 to 17. 

17 + 7 = 24

So, the depth of the water on Tuesday is 24 feet. 

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find two thirds of 24, we multiply 24 by 2 and then divide by 3.

24 * 2 = 48
48 / 3 = 16

So, the depth of the water on Wednesday is 16 feet.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 

Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.

Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.

Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up all the fish they caught. Anakin caught 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish. Locsin caught 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish.

In total, they caught 19 + 13 = 32 fish.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the cost of the marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase every two months and add it to the original price.

The original price of the marbles is $20.

After 2 months, the price increases by 20% of $20, which is 0.2 x $20 = $4. 
So, the price after 2 months is $20 + $4 = $24.

After 4 months, the price increases by 20% of $24, which is 0.2 x $24 = $4.80.
So, the price after 4 months is $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.

After 6 months, the price increases by 20% of $28.80, which is 0.2 x $28.80 = $5.76.
So, the price after 6 months is $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56.

After 8 months, the price increases by 20% of $34.56, which is 0.2 x $34.56 = $6.912.
So, the price after 8 months is $34.56 + $6.912 = $41.472.

After 10 months, the price increases by 20% of $41.472, which is 0.2 x $41.472 = $8.2944.
So, the price after 10 months is $41.472 + $8.2944 = $49.7664.

After 12 months, the price increases by 20% of $49.7664, which is 0.2 x $49.7664 = $9.95328.
So, the price after 12 months is $49.7664 + $9.95328 = $59.71968.

After 14 months, the price increases by 20% of $59.71968, which is 0.2 x $59.71968 = $11.943936.
So, the price after 14 months is $59.71968 + $11.943936 = $71.663616.

After 16 months, the price increases by 20% of $71.663616, which is 0.2 x $71.663616 = $14.3327232.
So, the price after 16 months is $71.663616 + $14.3327232 = $85.9963392.

After 18 months, the price increases by 20% of $85.9963392, which is 0.2 x $85.9963392 = $17.19926784.
So, the price after 18 months is $85.9963392 + $17.19926784 = $103.19560704.

After 20 months, the price increases by 20% of $103.19560704, which is 0.2 x $103.19560704 = $20.639121208.
So, the price after 20 months is $103.19560704 + $20.639121208 = $123.834728248.

After 22 months, the price increases by 20% of $123.834728248, which is 0.2 x $123.834728248 = $24.7669456496.
So, the price after 22 months is $123.834728248 + $24.7669456496 = $148.601673898.

After 24 months, the price increases by 20% of $148.601673898, which is 0.2 x $148.601673898 = $29.7203347796.
So, the price after 24 months is $148.601673898 + $29.7203347796 = $178.322008678.

After 26 months, the price increases by 20% of $178.322008678, which is 0.2 x $178.322008678 = $35.664401736.
So, the price after 26 months is $178.322008678 + $35.664401736 = $213.986410414.

After 28 months, the price increases by 20% of $213.986410414, which is 0.2 x $213.986410414 = $42.7972820828.
So, the price after 28 months is $213.986410414 + $42.7972820828 = $256.783692497.

After 30 months, the price increases by 20% of $256.783692497, which is 0.2 x $256.783692497 = $51.3567384994.
So, the price after 30 months is $256.783692497 + $51.3567384994 = $308.140430996.

After 32 months, the price increases by 20% of $308.140430996, which is 0.2 x $308.140430996 = $61.6280861992.
So, the price after 32 months is $308.140430996 + $61.6280861992 = $369.768517195.

After 34 months, the price increases by 20% of $369.768517195, which is 0.2 x $369.768517195 = $73.953703439.
So, the price after 34 months is $369.768517195 + $73.953703439 = $443.722220634.

After 36 months, the price increases by 20% of $443.722220634, which is 0.2 x $443.722220634 = $88.7444443268.
So, the price after 36 months is $443.722220634 + $88.7444443268 = $532.466665.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Since an action figure costs $5, the doll costs 3 x $5 = $15.

We also know that one red car costs $4. 

Now, we have 5 red cars, so the total cost of the red cars is 5 x $4 = $20.

We also have 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5, so the total cost of the action figures is 3 x $5 = $15.

The doll costs $15. 

To find the total cost of all the toys, we add the cost of the red cars, the action figures, and the doll: $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.

The total cost of all the toys is $50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the money she'll lose by doing her taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's find out how much money she'll lose by doing her taxes herself. She'll lose 3 hours of freelance work, and she earns $35/hour. So, she'll lose 3 x $35 = $105.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of hiring the accountant, which is $90. 

So, if she hires the accountant, she'll have $105 - $90 = $15 more.

Cost of the scanner: €157
Cost of the CD burner: €74
Cost of the printer: €102

Total cost of accessories: €157 + €74 + €102 = €333

Now, let's add the cost of the computer to the total cost of the accessories:

Total cost: €1090 + €333 = €1423

Now, let's subtract the total cost from Elvira's budget:

Elvira's budget: €1500
Total cost: €1423

Money left for clothing: €1500 - €1423 = €77

The final answer is: €77"
"To find out how many times Sandra has to babysit, we need to know how many eggs she needs in total to make 15 Spanish flans. Since each flan needs 3 eggs, we multiply 15 (number of flans) by 3 (number of eggs per flan).

15 * 3 = 45 eggs

Now, we know Sandra gets 9 eggs every time she babysits. To find out how many times she has to babysit, we need to divide the total number of eggs she needs (45) by the number of eggs she gets each time (9).

45 / 9 = 5

So, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to get enough eggs to make 15 Spanish flans.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's say Brooke's age is B. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's age is 2B.

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be B + 2 and Seth's age will be 2B + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 3B + 4.

We know that the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can set up the equation 3B + 4 = 28.

To solve for B, we need to subtract 4 from both sides of the equation: 3B = 24.

Next, we divide both sides by 3: B = 8.

Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's age is 2B = 2(8) = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break it down. Ethel has $8. Twice the money Ethel has would be 2 x 8 = 16. Jimmy has $2 more than that, so we add 2 to 16. 16 + 2 = 18.

"To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the miles he walks in a week. 

There are 7 days in a week. Pancho walks 20 miles a day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, he walks 20 * 5 = 100 miles from Monday to Friday. 

On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. So, he walks 10 * 2 = 20 miles on the weekends.

Now, we add the miles he walks from Monday to Friday and the miles he walks on the weekends. 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

So, Pancho walks 120 miles in a week.

"To find the cost of each uniform, we need to find the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants, and then add them together.

The hat costs $25.

The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 x $25 = $75.

The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. The average cost is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100 / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

"To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to first find out how much she pays each month. 

Her student loans have a minimum payment of $300, but she wants to pay 50% more than that. 50% of $300 is $150. So, she will pay $300 + $150 = $450 for her student loans each month.

Her credit card's minimum is $200, and she wants to pay 50% more than that. 50% of $200 is $100. So, she will pay $200 + $100 = $300 for her credit card each month.

Her mortgage's minimum is $500, and she wants to pay 50% more than that. 50% of $500 is $250. So, she will pay $500 + $250 = $750 for her mortgage each month.

Now, we need to add up how much she pays each month. $450 + $300 + $750 = $1500. 

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12. $1500 * 12 = $18,000.

"To find out how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to add up the time it takes to peel and cut each potato. 

First, let's find out how long it takes to peel one potato. It takes 1.5 minutes to peel a potato. 

Now, let's find out how long it takes to cut one potato. It takes 5 seconds to cut a potato. We need to convert this to minutes because we're adding it to the peeling time. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 5 seconds is 5/60 = 1/12 of a minute.

Now, let's add the peeling and cutting time together. 1.5 minutes (peeling) + 1/12 minute (cutting) = 1.5 + 0.0833 = 1.5833 minutes.

Since it takes 1.5833 minutes to peel and cut one potato, we need to multiply this by the total number of potatoes. There are 60 potatoes, so it will take 1.5833 * 60 = 95 minutes to peel and cut all the potatoes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much they made in total from selling lemonade. Since they get 20 glasses per gallon and sell each glass for $0.50, they make 20 x $0.50 = $10 per gallon.

They made a profit of $25, so their total income from selling lemonade is $25 + (cost of lemons and sugar). Let's call the number of gallons they made x. Then, their total income is 10x.

The cost of making lemonade is $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar per gallon, so the total cost per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.

Their total cost is 5x, so their total income is 10x = 5x + $25 (profit). 

Now, let's solve for x. Subtract 5x from both sides: 5x = $25. Divide both sides by 5: x = $5.

Now that we know they made 5 gallons, we can find the total cost of lemons. The cost of lemons per gallon is $3, so the total cost of lemons is 3x = 3 * 5 = $15.

1. Zaid earns 6000$ per month.
2. He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 * 6000 = 1500$.
3. He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 1/3 * 6000 = 2000$.
4. The remaining amount after rent and car fuel is 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500$.
5. He donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity, which is 1/2 * 2500 = 1250$.
6. The remaining amount after donation is 2500 - 1250 = 1250$.
7. He gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$, so the total amount given to them is 200 + 700 = 900$.

So, the winner got 60 votes. 

Since the total number of students who voted is 80, the number of votes the loser got is the total number of votes minus the votes the winner got.

Votes the loser got = Total votes - Votes the winner got

"To find out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time it takes for both teams to finish the race.

The well-rounded team's total time is easy to calculate since each member runs 55 seconds. There are 4 members, so the total time is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

For the less well-rounded team, the first runner runs 60 seconds, the second runner runs 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, the third runner runs 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth runner runs 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. To find the total time, we add these up: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

Now, we subtract the well-rounded team's time from the less well-rounded team's time to find the difference: 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To find out how much more likely it is that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probability of each event and then find the difference.

First, let's find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die (4, 5, and 6). So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 or 1/2.

Next, let's find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The probability of rolling an even number on a six-sided die is 3/6 or 1/2. Since the die is rolled twice, we multiply the probabilities together: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

Now, we need to find the difference between the two probabilities. To do this, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/4) * 100 = 25%.

So, it is 25% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know that there are 10 cages of hamsters and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of straw given to hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

We also know that 20 pieces of straw are given to the rabbits.

Now, we know that the total number of straw given to all the small rodents is 160. We already know that 50 + 20 = 70 straw is given to hamsters and rabbits. So, the remaining straw is given to the rats.

The remaining straw given to rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

We know that the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Let's say the number of rats in each cage is 'r'. Then, the total number of rats is 3r.

The total number of straw given to rats is 90, and each rat gets 6 straw. So, the total number of rats is 90 / 6 = 15.

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, the number of rats in each cage is 15 / 3 = 5.

"To find out how much Mandy should give to Benedict, we need to calculate the interest first. 

The interest is 2% of $100. To find 2% of a number, we multiply the number by 0.02. 

So, 2% of $100 is $100 x 0.02 = $2.

Now, we need to add the interest to the original amount. 

$100 (original amount) + $2 (interest) = $102.

Since Mandy is paying after 3 months, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months. We already calculated the interest for 1 month, which is $2. 

To find the interest for 3 months, we multiply the interest for 1 month by 3. 

$2 x 3 = $6.

Now, we add the interest for 3 months to the original amount. 

$100 (original amount) + $6 (interest for 3 months) = $106.

So, Mandy should give $106 to Benedict.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that the total cost of the tickets is $20.25. 

They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets, so the cost of the food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

The cost of the rides is $33 for each ride, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost of the rides is $33 * 2 = $66.

Now, let's add up all the costs: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we need to divide the total cost by 3 (the number of friends). 

$102 / 3 = $34.

"To find out how many peaches John collects, we need to multiply the number of hours he collects peaches by the number of peaches he collects per hour. 

First, we need to convert the hours to minutes because John collects peaches per minute. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is 3 x 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, we multiply the number of minutes by the number of peaches he collects per minute. 180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches.

So, John collects 360 peaches.

360"
"To find out how many pounds of insects the ducks need per day, we need to divide the total pounds of insects they need per week by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).

First, we multiply the pounds of insects per duck per week by the number of ducks: 
3.5 pounds/duck/week * 10 ducks = 35 pounds/week

Now, we divide the total pounds of insects per week by 7:
35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break it down step by step.

Tom starts with 50 trees. 

He plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year. So, the net change in trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8 trees.

After 10 years, the total change in trees will be 8 * 10 = 80 trees.

So, the total number of trees after 10 years will be 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

But, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find 30% of 130, we multiply 130 by 0.3.

0.3 * 130 = 39

So, 39 trees die. 

Now, we subtract 39 from the total number of trees after 10 years.

130 - 39 = 91

The final answer is: 91"
"To find out how many pink and white flamingos there are, we need to break it down step by step.

On Friday, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out. So, there are now 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday, they added 18 more pink flamingos to the collection. So, there are now 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos.

To find out how many white flamingos there are, we need to remember that 6 flamingos were painted white on Saturday. There are still 6 white flamingos.

Now, we need to find out how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos. To do this, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how much change Violetta will get, we need to know how many crayons she can buy with $20. Since one crayon costs $2, we can divide $20 by $2 to find out how many crayons she can buy.

20 ÷ 2 = 10

Since Violetta needs 5 crayons, she can buy 5 crayons with $10. She will have $10 left as change.

So, Violetta will get $10 as change."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. So, we can say that the cost of a pen is equal to the cost of a pencil plus the cost of an eraser. 

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now, we know that the cost of a pen is $1.50. To find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8.

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to first find out how many pounds of carrots will be used. 

Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. So, the total pounds of carrots used will be 2 * 40 = 80 pounds.

Now, we know that 200 pounds of carrots are to be distributed. If 80 pounds are used, then the pounds of carrots that will not be used will be 200 - 80 = 120 pounds.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the number of kids in Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population. 

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Number of kids = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)
= 23786 - (8417 + 9092)
= 23786 - 17509
= 6277

The final answer is: 6277"
"Let's break it down step by step.

Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards. 

In the first month, she collected three times that number, so she collected 3 x 20 = 60 cards. Now she has 20 + 60 = 80 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, so she collected 60 - 20 = 40 cards. Now she has 80 + 40 = 120 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number is 60 + 40 = 100. So, she collected 2 x 100 = 200 cards. Now she has 120 + 200 = 320 cards.

The final answer is: 320"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Mark edits 1000 sentences each week. He edits an equal number of sentences for two publishers, so he edits 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, so he makes 500 * 5 = 2500 cents from Publisher A.

Publisher B pays him twice what Publisher A pays, so he makes 2 * 5 = 10 cents per sentence from Publisher B. He makes 500 * 10 = 5000 cents from Publisher B.

To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we add the money he makes from both publishers: 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

The final answer is: 7500"
"To find out how many liters of water Baldur gets every day, we need to find out how many pails of water he gets in a day and then multiply that by the number of liters in each pail.

Baldur gets 5 pails of water every morning and 6 pails of water every afternoon. So, in a day, he gets 5 + 6 = 11 pails of water.

Each pail contains 5 liters of water. So, if he gets 11 pails of water, he gets 11 x 5 = 55 liters of water every day.

The final answer is: 55"
"To find out how much John made that year, we need to calculate his new salary after the 5% raise and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

First, let's find the 5% raise. 5% of 2000 is 0.05 x 2000 = 100. 

So, his new salary is 2000 + 100 = 2100 per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year. 

Now, let's multiply his new salary by the number of weeks: 2100 x 52 = 109200.

Now, let's add the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to his total salary: 109200 + 5000 = 114200.

So, John made $114200 that year.

The final answer is: $114200"
"To find out how many barrels of wine Josie's farm produces per year, we need to multiply the number of acres by the number of tons of grapes each acre produces, and then multiply that by the number of barrels each ton of grapes makes.

First, we multiply the number of acres by the number of tons of grapes each acre produces: 10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons of grapes.

Next, we multiply the total tons of grapes by the number of barrels each ton makes: 50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels.

So, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.

The final answer is: 100"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch, and he used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. There are 7 days in a week, so he ate 7 sandwiches. 

7 sandwiches * 2 slices per sandwich = 14 slices of cheese for sandwiches.

He ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. So, he used 3 slices per omelet. 

3 omelets * 3 slices per omelet = 9 slices of cheese for omelets.

He used 8 slices of cheese in the macaroni and cheese dish.

Now, let's add up all the cheese slices: 
14 slices for sandwiches + 9 slices for omelets + 8 slices for macaroni and cheese = 31 slices of cheese.

The final answer is: 31"
"Let's break it down step by step. Janet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. That's a total of 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

Then she bought 6 bags of blue pens. Each bag has 9 pens, so she bought 6 x 9 = 54 blue pens.

She also bought 2 bags of red pens. Each bag has 6 pens, so she bought 2 x 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, let's add all the pens together: 32 (initial pens) + 54 (blue pens) + 12 (red pens) = 98 pens.

We also need to remember that she had 10 yellow pens. So, the total number of pens Janet has now is 98 + 10 = 108 pens.

The final answer is: 108"
"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we need to first find the total score she needs for the six tests. 

Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score each semester, we need to find the lowest score among the first five tests. The lowest score is 71.

We will remove this score from the total score. 

The total score of the first five tests is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 338.

Now, we will remove the lowest score (71) from the total score. 
338 - 71 = 267

Since Brinley wants an average of 93, we need to find the total score for six tests. 
The average is the total score divided by the number of tests. 
Let's multiply the average by the number of tests to find the total score. 
93 * 6 = 558

Now, we need to add the score of the sixth test to the total score of the first five tests (after removing the lowest score) to get the total score for six tests. 
558 - 267 = 291

So, Brinley needs a score of 291 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, Micheal rode his bike 5 times a week for 4 weeks. So, he rode 5 * 4 = 20 times. Each time he rode 25 kilometers, so he rode 20 * 25 = 500 kilometers.

Then, he rode his bike 2 times a week for 3 weeks. So, he rode 2 * 3 = 6 times. Each time he rode 60 kilometers, so he rode 6 * 60 = 360 kilometers.

Now, we need to add the kilometers he rode in both cases. 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

The final answer is: 860"
"To find the total weight of the bag of candy, we need to find the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples, then add them together.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40g. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, we multiply 25 by 40g to find the total weight of the chocolate bars.

25 * 40g = 1000g

Next, we know that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. So, each candied apple weighs half as much as a chocolate bar, which is 40g / 2 = 20g.

Since there are 80 candied apples, we multiply 80 by 20g to find the total weight of the candied apples.

80 * 20g = 1600g

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy.

1000g + 1600g = 2600g

The final answer is: 2600"

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 x 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 x 12 = 60 cakes.

To find the total number of cakes she bought after all three days, we need to add the number of cakes she bought each day. 

4 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 60 (Wednesday) = 76

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, half a dozen plates will cost 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

Now, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, twenty dozen cups will be 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

To find the cost of each cup, we need to divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups. So, the cost of each cup is $34,800 / 240 = $145.

The final answer is: $145"
"To find out how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we need to know how much money she needs to buy the jacket and shoes, and how much money she earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn.

The jacket costs $30 and 2 pairs of shoes cost $20 each, so the total cost is $30 + $20 + $20 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. She earns $5 each time she babysits, so she earns $5 x 4 = $20 from babysitting. 

To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the money she already has and the money she earns from babysitting from the total cost: $70 - $10 - $20 = $40.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she must mow the lawn, we divide the amount she needs ($40) by the amount she earns from mowing the lawn ($4): $40 / $4 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's say the number of red chickens is x. Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, the number of white chickens is x + 2.

Red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs from red chickens is 3x. White chickens produce 5 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs from white chickens is 5(x + 2).

The total number of eggs Jerry collects is 42, so we can set up the equation:

3x + 5(x + 2) = 42

Combine like terms:

3x + 5x + 10 = 42

Combine like terms again:

8x + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8x = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

x = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we need to find the total distance he walks and then divide it by his speed.

The park is a rectangle, so we need to find the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up the lengths of all its sides. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)

In this case, the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles. 

Perimeter = 2(6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2(7.5)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Since Gary walks around the edge of the park, he walks the entire perimeter. 

Now, we need to divide the perimeter by his speed to find out how many hours he spends walking. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, in 4 minutes, each pool lost 4 gallons of water. So, the small pool now has x - 4 gallons of water, and the big pool now has 2x - 4 gallons of water.

We are told that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, we can set up the equation:

2x - 4 = 4(x - 4)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 4 = 4x - 16

Add 4 to both sides:

2x = 4x - 12

Subtract 4x from both sides:

-2x = -12

Divide both sides by -2:

x = 6

So, the small pool had 6 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Now, the small pool has 6 - 4 = 2 gallons of water.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"

"To find out how much Janeth will have paid in total, we need to multiply the monthly payment by the number of months. 

$165 * 12 = $1980

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. 10% of $2000 is $200. So, she will return $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Now, we need to subtract the total amount she paid from the total amount she will return. 

$2200 - $1980 = $220

So, Janeth's remaining balance will be $220."

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know Harriet is 21 years old. Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is 2 times Harriet's age. So, Zack's age is 2 x 21 = 42 years old.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age is 3 x 21 = 63 years old.

Now, we need to find their ages in three years. 

In three years, Harriet will be 21 + 3 = 24 years old.
In three years, Zack will be 42 + 3 = 45 years old.
In three years, Adrian will be 63 + 3 = 66 years old.

To find the average age, we need to add their ages and divide by 3. 
Average age = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45.

"Let's break down the information given. Naomi scored 68 points. 

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 10 more than that is 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. Naomi scored 68 points, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

We know that the total points scored by the four students is 251. Naomi scored 68, Yuri scored 44, and Brianna scored 85. To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to subtract the points scored by the other three students from the total points. 

Total points - (Naomi's points + Yuri's points + Brianna's points) = Jojo's points
251 - (68 + 44 + 85) = 251 - 197 = 54

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to know the total number of cards and the number of water type cards. 

First, let's find the total number of cards. James starts with 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type. 

Total cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

Then, James loses 8 water type cards. 

Number of water type cards left = 40 - 8 = 32

Now, James buys 14 grass type cards. 

Number of grass type cards = 20 + 14 = 34

Total cards now = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

The percentage chance of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, multiplied by 100.

Percentage chance = (32 / 96) * 100 = 33.333...

"To find out how much Chad still owes, we need to calculate the total cost of his meal and then subtract the gift card amount.

First, let's add up the cost of the items Chad added to his burrito:

- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces: 2 x $0.25 = $0.50
- Total added items: $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50

Now, let's add the cost of the base burrito and the added items:

- Base burrito: $6.50
- Added items: $4.50
- Total so far: $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00

Next, Chad upgrades his meal for $3.00, so we add that to the total:

- Total so far: $11.00
- Upgrade: $3.00
- New total: $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

Now, Chad uses his gift card for $5.00, so we subtract that from the total:

- New total: $14.00
- Gift card: -$5.00
- Amount owed: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

So, Chad still owes $9.00.

"To find out how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can place per minute, we need to know how many pieces her mom can place per minute. Since her mom can place half as many pieces as Kalinda, and Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute, her mom can place 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

Now, we know that together they can place 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place per minute. 

360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes

Since we need to find out how many hours it will take, we need to convert the minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we can divide 60 minutes by 60 to get the number of hours.

"First, we need to find out how much Mark pays for the cars. He buys 12 cars for $20,000 each. 

12 * 20,000 = 240,000

Then, he pays 10% tax on the cars. 10% of 240,000 is 0.1 * 240,000 = 24,000.

Now, we add the tax to the cost of the cars. 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000.

Next, we need to add the registration fee for each car. There are 12 cars, and each costs $1000 to register. 

12 * 1000 = 12,000

Now, we add the registration fee to the total cost of the cars and tax. 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000.

The final answer is: 276,000"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, so Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. To find out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we need to multiply the number of shells she collected on Monday by 2. 

25 * 2 = 50

So, Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesday.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break it down. Dax found half as many bugs as ants. This means the number of bugs is equal to the number of ants divided by 2. 

Number of ants = 50
Number of bugs = 50 / 2 = 25

To find the total number of insects, we need to add the number of ants and bugs together.

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
Total number of insects = 50 + 25
Total number of insects = 75

The final answer is: 75"
"To find out how many penguins are left sunbathing, we need to know how many penguins jumped in the ocean and how many went inside the cave. 

One-third of the penguins jumped in the ocean. Since there are 36 penguins, one-third of them is 36 / 3 = 12. 

Another one-third of the penguins went inside the cave. One-third of 36 is also 12.

So, in total, 12 + 12 = 24 penguins left the sunbathing area. 

To find out how many penguins are left sunbathing, we need to subtract 24 from the total number of penguins. 

36 - 24 = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, he eats 6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes per week.

We also know that Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend. So, his girlfriend eats half of what Steve eats, which is 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes per week.

Now, we know that Steve and his girlfriend together eat 42 + 21 = 63 tomatoes per week.

Since each vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, we need to divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by the number of tomatoes each vine produces per week. 

63 / 3 = 21 vines.

So, Steve needs 21 vines to grow enough tomatoes for himself and his girlfriend. 

21"
"To find out how many pizzas John needs to order, we need to figure out how many slices of pizza he needs in total. 

There are 20 friends, and each friend needs 4 slices. So, we multiply 20 friends by 4 slices per friend. 

20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices

Since pizzas are sold in 8 slices, we need to divide the total number of slices by 8 to find out how many pizzas John needs to order.

80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas

So, John needs to order 10 pizzas. 

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Ram buys 25 pens. 

He uses 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. So, for every 5 empty pens, he gets 1 new pen. 

To find out how many new pens he can make from 25 pens, we need to divide 25 by 5. 

25 / 5 = 5 

So, he can make 5 new pens from the 25 pens. 

Now, he has 25 - 5 = 20 empty pens left. 

He can use these 20 empty pens to make 20 / 5 = 4 new pens. 

Now, he has 20 - 4 = 16 empty pens left. 

He can use these 16 empty pens to make 16 / 5 = 3.2 new pens. Since you can't make a fraction of a pen, we'll round down to 3 new pens.

"To find out how much money Johnny had after a year, we need to follow the steps he took.

First, Johnny started with $20 and added $10 to it. So, he had $20 + $10 = $30.

Then, he invested this sum of money, which tripled in a year. This means that the $30 he had became 3 times that amount.

To find 3 times $30, we multiply $30 by 3. 

$30 * 3 = $90

So, after a year, Johnny had $90."

Joan is five years older than Jessa, so Joan is 20 + 5 = 25 years old. 
Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary is 25 - 2 = 23 years old.

"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, 30% of the students went out through exit A. 
   30% of 1000 is 0.3 x 1000 = 300 students.

2. Now, we have 1000 - 300 = 700 students left in the hall.

3. Then, 3/5 of the remaining 700 students went out through exit B.
   3/5 of 700 is (3/5) x 700 = 420 students.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

We know John has 54 candies. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can find out how many candies Robert has by dividing John's candies by 2. 

Robert's candies = John's candies / 2
Robert's candies = 54 / 2
Robert's candies = 27

We also know James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, we can find out how many candies James has by adding 6 to Robert's candies.

James' candies = Robert's candies + 6
James' candies = 27 + 6
James' candies = 33

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. We can do this by subtracting James' candies from John's candies.

Difference = John's candies - James' candies
Difference = 54 - 33
Difference = 21

"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to find out how many letters he writes and then multiply that by the time it takes him to write one letter.

First, let's find out how many letters Mike writes. He has 3 penpals left. Each of them sends 2 letters a week, and he responds in kind. So, he gets 2 * 3 = 6 letters a week. Since he responds to each letter, he writes 6 letters a week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, and he can write a page every 6 minutes. So, to write one letter, it takes him 5 * 6 = 30 minutes.

Now, we multiply the number of letters he writes by the time it takes to write one letter: 6 * 30 = 180 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to first find out how many minutes he used in total.

He also had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. 

So, the total minutes he used is 450 + 300 = 750 minutes.

Since Jason's phone plan is 1000 minutes per month, we need to subtract the total minutes he used from his plan. 

1000 - 750 = 250 minutes.

So, Jason has 250 minutes left.

Griffin had 24 fries initially. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 fries left.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 x 5 = 10 fries. Now Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries left.

Ginger gave Griffin some fries, and then Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So Colby took 2 fries.

After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had 9 - 2 = 7 fries left. But we know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So Ginger must have given Griffin 27 - 7 = 20 fries.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's say the number of fish in each aquarium is x. 

Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

This difference is also twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, so we can write an equation:

28 = 2(2x)

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

14 = 2x

Now, divide both sides by 2 again:

7 = x

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"To find out how much Jean paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the makeup first. 

The makeup artist charges $250 an hour and works 6 hours a day. So, the cost for one day is 250 * 6 = $1500.

Since she needs it done 4 times a week, the weekly cost is 1500 * 4 = $6000.

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so the total cost before the discount is 6000 * 5 = $30,000.

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 0.1 (which is the same as 10%): 30000 * 0.1 = $3000.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: 30000 - 3000 = $27000.

So, Jean paid $27,000."
"To find out how much each person paid, we need to add up all the money Isabelle spent. 

First, let's add up the money she spent: 
$12 (cake) + $43 (presents) = $55
$55 + $15 (decorations) = $70
$70 + $4 (invitations) = $74
$74 + $22 (goodie bags) = $96

Now, we know Isabelle spent a total of $96. Since she split the cost with her two parents, we need to divide the total by 3 (Isabelle and her two parents).

$96 ÷ 3 = $32

Each person paid $32."
"To find out how much the chef spent, we need to know the total weight of the onions and then multiply it by the cost per pound.

The chef bought 4 bags of onions, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. So, the total weight of the onions is 4 x 50 = 200 pounds.

Since a pound of onions costs $1.50, we multiply the total weight by the cost per pound: 200 pounds x $1.50 = $300.

The chef spent $300."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies, so Sue ate 4 x 5 = 20 cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 13 cookies, so Sue ate 2 x 13 = 26 cookies.

Now, let's add up the total number of cookies Sue and her sister ate. Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies, and her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, we multiply the total number of cookies each of them ate by 200. Sue ate 46 cookies, so she consumed 46 x 200 = 9200 calories. Her sister ate 18 cookies, so she consumed 18 x 200 = 3600 calories.

To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we subtract the calories her sister consumed from the calories Sue consumed. 9200 - 3600 = 5600.

The final answer is: 5600"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know that the school is 50% boys and 50% girls. This means that the total number of boys and girls in the school is equal. 

Since there are 3 classes, and each class has 20 students, the total number of students in the school is 3 x 20 = 60.

We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the school is 15 + 12 = 27.

Since the school is 50% girls, the total number of boys in the school is also 27 (because 50% of 60 is 30, but we already know there are 27 girls, so the boys must be 27 too).

Now, let's find out how many students are in the first two classes. The first class has 20 students, and the second class has 20 students. So, the total number of students in the first two classes is 20 + 20 = 40.

Since the total number of students in the school is 60, and 40 students are in the first two classes, the number of students in the third class is 60 - 40 = 20.

We know that the first two classes have a total of 15 + 12 = 27 girls. Since the third class has 20 students, and the school is 50% girls, the number of girls in the third class is 50% of 20, which is 10.

Now, we know that the third class has 20 students and 10 of them are girls. So, the number of boys in the third class is 20 - 10 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many apps Travis has now, we need to subtract the apps he deleted and add the apps he downloaded.

First, let's subtract the apps he deleted: 61 - 9 = 52

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. 

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's say the number of cougars he killed today is x. Then, the number of wolves he killed today is 3x.

We also know that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, the number of cougars he killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since we know the number of cougars he killed today is 12, we can set up the equation 3x = 12. To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 12 / 3 = 4.

Now that we know x is 4, we can find the number of wolves he killed today by multiplying 3 and 4: 3x = 3 * 4 = 12.

So, Rick killed 12 wolves and 12 cougars today.

To find the total number of animals Rick killed, we add the number of animals he killed last night and today: 10 + 15 + 12 + 12 = 49.

The final answer is: 49"
"To find out which floor Bill is on, we need to calculate 4 times his starting floor (3) plus 6.

"To find out how many times Anne went down the slide, we need to find 30% of 30 and subtract that from 30. 

30% of 30 is 0.3 x 30 = 9. 

So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, so Robert went down the slide 4 x 21 = 84 times.

The final answer is: 84"
"So, Mr. Sylas has 10 stalls with 20 cows each. That's 10 x 20 = 200 cows. He buys 40 more cows. Now, he has 200 + 40 = 240 cows. He puts the new cows equally into the 10 stalls. So, he puts 40 new cows into each stall. Now, each stall has 20 + 4 = 24 cows. We want to know how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. So, we multiply 24 by 8. 24 x 8 = 192.

The final answer is: 192"
"To find out how much money Brady has, we need to calculate the total amount in cents and then convert it to dollars.

First, let's calculate the total amount in cents:

- 100 pennies = 100 cents
- 40 nickels = 40 x 5 = 200 cents
- 20 dimes = 20 x 10 = 200 cents
- 40 dollar bills = 40 x 100 = 4000 cents (but we need to convert this to dollars first)

Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, we can convert the dollar bills to cents:
- 40 dollar bills = 40 x 100 = 4000 cents

Now, let's add up all the amounts in cents:
- 100 cents + 200 cents + 200 cents + 4000 cents = 4500 cents

To convert the total amount from cents to dollars, we divide by 100:
- 4500 cents / 100 = 45 dollars

So, Brady has 45 dollars in his piggy bank.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the total weight of the redwood tree, we need to find out how many 10-foot sections it has. 

The redwood is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get the number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how much the termites ate. They ate 30% of the wood, so we multiply the total weight by 0.3: 8000 * 0.3 = 2400 pounds.

To find the weight of the redwood after the termites ate, we subtract the weight they ate from the total weight: 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds.

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find out how much Nancy has to pay, we need to add the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee. 

First, let's find the cost of the overdue books. Nancy owes $0.50 cents each on 8 books. 

8 books * $0.50 per book = $4.00

Now, we need to add the flat fee of $2.00. 

$4.00 (overdue books) + $2.00 (flat fee) = $6.00

So, Nancy has to pay a total of $6.00. 

The final answer is: $6.00"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Andrea has 52 apples. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of apples and bananas that Andrea and Jamal have. 

Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, so that's 52 + 24 = 76 fruits from Andrea. 
Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas, so that's 44 + 48 = 92 fruits from Jamal.

In total, there are 76 + 92 = 168 fruits. 

The final answer is: 168"
"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we need to know how many cookies she's making in total and how many cups of flour are needed for each cookie.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. So, she's making a total of 36 + 30 = 66 cookies.

We know that 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies. A dozen is 12 cookies. So, for 12 cookies, 2 cups of flour are needed.

To find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we need to divide 66 by 12 and then multiply the result by 2.

66 ÷ 12 = 5.5
5.5 * 2 = 11

So, Carla needs 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

"To find two thirds of the pennies, we need to multiply 9,300 by 2/3. 

First, we multiply 9,300 by 2, which is 18,600. 

Then, we divide 18,600 by 3 to find two thirds of the pennies. 

18,600 divided by 3 is 6,200.

Since each penny is worth 1 cent, or 0.01 dollars, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount.

6,200 multiplied by 0.01 is 62.

The final answer is: $62"
"Maddison has 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each box. To find out how many marbles she has in total, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of marbles in each box.

5 boxes * 50 marbles/box = 250 marbles

Then, Maddison gets 20 marbles from her friend. To find out how many marbles she has now, we need to add the marbles she got from her friend to the marbles she already had.

250 marbles + 20 marbles = 270 marbles

So, Maddison has 270 marbles now.

270"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Chris has 6 trees. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, so Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.

Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has is 2 x 3 = 6. 5 more than that is 6 + 5 = 11.

So, Harry has 11 trees. 

To find out how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard, we need to subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard. 11 - 3 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"

"To find the total price of the house, we need to add the brokerage fee and the transfer fee to the selling price.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 5% of $350,000. To find 5% of $350,000, we multiply $350,000 by 0.05.

$350,000 x 0.05 = $17,500

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 12% of $350,000. To find 12% of $350,000, we multiply $350,000 by 0.12.

$350,000 x 0.12 = $42,000

Now, we add the brokerage fee and the transfer fee to the selling price to find the total price of the house.

$350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500

The total price of the house is $409,500. To find how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price.

$409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500

The final answer is: $9,500"
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds, we need to first calculate the total amount he paid in fees and the loan, then subtract that from the selling price.

The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price, which is 3% of $400,000. To find 3% of $400,000, we multiply 0.03 by $400,000.

0.03 x $400,000 = $12,000

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 5% of $400,000. To find 5% of $400,000, we multiply 0.05 by $400,000.

0.05 x $400,000 = $20,000

The total amount Mr. Tan paid in fees is $12,000 (transfer fees) + $20,000 (brokerage fee) = $32,000.

He also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount.

To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds, we subtract the total amount he paid in fees and the loan from the selling price.

Net proceeds = Selling price - Total fees and loan
= $400,000 - ($32,000 + $250,000)

"First, we need to find out how long it takes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees. It takes 20 minutes to heat up to 300 degrees. It takes 40% longer to heat up to 400 degrees. 40% of 20 minutes is 8 minutes. So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.

Now, we know it takes 28 minutes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees. After warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. So, it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook.

The total time is the time it takes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees plus the time it takes to cook. So, the total time is 28 + 23 = 51 minutes.

First, we find out how many windows are in the bedrooms. Each house has 3 bedrooms and each bedroom has 2 windows. So, 3 bedrooms * 2 windows = 6 windows in each house. Since there are 2 houses, that's 6 * 2 = 12 windows in the bedrooms.

Next, we find out how many windows are not connected to bedrooms. There are 4 windows in each house, and there are 2 houses, so that's 4 * 2 = 8 windows.

Now, we add the windows in the bedrooms and the windows not connected to bedrooms. 12 + 8 = 20 windows.

"Let's break down the information given. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches. The collar takes a tenth of that number, so it's 900 / 10 = 90 stitches. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it's 2 x 90 = 180 stitches.

We know the whole sweater is 1800 stitches. We already know the body and rosette take 900 + 180 = 1080 stitches. To find out how many stitches the sleeves take, we need to subtract that from the total number of stitches. So, 1800 - 1080 = 720 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, we need to divide the number of stitches by 2 to find out how many each sleeve takes. 720 / 2 = 360 stitches per sleeve.

"To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to find out how many lines are in the first scene, the second scene, and the solo song, and then add them up.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song, so it has 2 x 54 = 108 lines. But only a third of them are Sean's lines, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the solo song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of them are Sean's lines, so he has 4/5 x 60 = 48 lines from the second scene.

Now, we add up all the lines: 54 (solo song) + 36 (first scene) + 48 (second scene) = 138.

First, let's find the total time it takes to dig the small holes. Matthew digs 30 small holes, and each small hole takes 3 minutes. 

30 small holes * 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes

Next, let's find the total time it takes to dig the large holes. Matthew digs 15 large holes, and each large hole takes 10 minutes.

15 large holes * 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes

Now, we add the time it takes to dig the small holes and the time it takes to dig the large holes.

90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

"Let's break it down. If the sum of Mico and Marco's ages is 20 now, that means Mico's age + Marco's age = 20.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be Mico's current age + 10, and Marco's age will be Marco's current age + 10.

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be (Mico's current age + 10) + (Marco's current age + 10).

Since we know that Mico's current age + Marco's current age = 20, we can replace Mico's current age + Marco's current age with 20 in the equation.

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 20 + 10 + 10 = 40.

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, Ruby's current age is 6x.

In 9 years, Sam's age will be x + 9 and Ruby's age will be 6x + 9.

According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So, we can write the equation: 6x + 9 = 3(x + 9).

Now, let's solve the equation: 
6x + 9 = 3x + 27
6x - 3x = 27 - 9
3x = 18
x = 6

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

"To find out how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to find out how much space the topaz gemstones take up and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace. 

Each topaz gemstone is one inch long, and there are 8 of them. So, the total space taken up by the topaz gemstones is 8 inches. 

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. To find out how much space is left for the sterling silver beads, we subtract the space taken up by the topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace: 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long. To find out how many beads fit in 17 inches, we need to divide 17 by 0.25 (which is the same as 1/4).

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 3 x 8 = 24.

There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 x 6 = 12.

The total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36.

The total number of stars in the flag is 76.

So, the number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40.

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since it's traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, we can divide the speed of the fast lane car by 2.

Speed of the fast lane car = 60 miles/hour
Speed of the slow lane car = 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour

Now, we know the distance covered by both cars is the same, which is 480 miles. We can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed to find the time taken by the slow lane car.

Time = Distance / Speed

Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

It's given that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means the total medals given out is 10 times the medals they have. So, the total medals given out is 39 * 10 = 390.

The final answer is: 390"
"First, we need to find out how many chocolate bars there are in total. There are 8 packets of chocolate bars, and each packet has 5 chocolate bars. So, we multiply 8 packets by 5 chocolate bars to get the total number of chocolate bars.

8 packets * 5 chocolate bars = 40 chocolate bars

Now, we know that 4 adults will get 6 chocolate bars each. So, we multiply 4 adults by 6 chocolate bars to find out how many chocolate bars the adults will get.

4 adults * 6 chocolate bars = 24 chocolate bars

Now, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children. We subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults got from the total number of chocolate bars.

40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars = 16 chocolate bars

Now, we need to find out how many chocolate bars each child will get. There are 8 children, and they will share the remaining 16 chocolate bars equally. We divide 16 chocolate bars by 8 children to find out how many each child will get.

16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Susan earns, we need to know how many minutes she works. 

First, let's find out how many minutes she works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. There are 3 hours in between, and each hour has 60 minutes. So, 3 hours * 60 minutes = 180 minutes. 

But she pauses for half an hour, which is 30 minutes. So, we need to subtract 30 minutes from the total minutes she works. 180 minutes - 30 minutes = 150 minutes.

Now, we know Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, we divide 150 by 10. 150 / 10 = 15.

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, and there are 15 intervals, we multiply 5 by 15. 5 * 15 = 75.

So, Susan earns $75 for the online task. 

The final answer is: $75"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know Mike has 21 points. Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points. Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

Now, let's see who gets an extra point in the fourth round. Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point. Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he doesn't get an extra point. Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point.

So, after the extra points are distributed, Mike has 21 + 1 = 22 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up all their points: 22 + 18 + 43 = 83.

The final answer is: 83"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

The youngest son is half as old as the oldest son. Since the oldest son is 8 years old, the youngest son is 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

The oldest son has to wash 8 oranges and the youngest son has to wash 4 oranges. In total, they have to wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Will bought 15 oranges. If 12 oranges are washed, then the number of oranges left unwashed is 15 - 12 = 3.

"Let's break it down day by day.

Day 1: 
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Day 2: 
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's add up the total number of activities for both days:
- Day 1: 100 + 50 + 20 = 170
- Day 2: 120 + 40 + 40 = 200
- Total: 170 + 200 = 370

The final answer is: 370"
"To find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate how much rice is consumed in a day and then multiply it by the number of days in a week.

First, let's find out how much rice is consumed in a day. Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice every meal, and there are 3 meals in a day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). So, each person consumes 0.2 kg * 3 = 0.6 kg of rice per day.

Since there are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total rice consumption per day is 0.6 kg * 5 = 3 kg.

Now, let's find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. We can do this by dividing the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the daily consumption (3 kg). 

42 kg / 3 kg = 14 days

Since we want to know how many weeks it will last, we need to divide the number of days by 7 (the number of days in a week).

14 days / 7 days per week = 2 weeks

So, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 2 weeks. 

The final answer is: 2"
"Let's break down the problem. Sam's target is 120 crates in a week. He was closed on Monday and Friday, so he has 5 days to sell the bread. 

He sold 20 crates over the weekend. That's 2 days. So, he sold 20 / 2 = 10 crates per day on the weekend. 

On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates. On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates. On Thursday, he sold 18 crates. 

So, he sold 10 + 10 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates in 5 days. 

To find out how many crates he needs to sell in the remaining 2 days, we subtract the crates he already sold from his target: 120 - 65 = 55 crates. 

Since he already sold 20 crates over the weekend, he needs to sell 55 - 20 = 35 crates in the remaining 2 days. 

Since he was closed on Monday and Friday, the remaining 2 days are Tuesday and Wednesday. He already sold 15 crates on Tuesday, so he needs to sell 35 - 15 = 20 crates on Wednesday. 

But the question asks how many crates he was off from his target for the week. We already know he needs to sell 55 crates in the remaining 2 days. Since he can't sell a fraction of a crate, he can't meet his target. 

So, he is off by 55 crates. 

The final answer is: 55"

"To find out how much John pays a year for driving, we need to calculate the total miles driven, the total cost of driving, and then add the bonus.

First, let's find the total miles driven. John goes to work 30 miles away and comes back, so that's 30 + 30 = 60 miles per day. He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total miles driven is 60 * 5 * 50 = 15,000 miles.

Now, let's find the total cost of driving. John gets charged $2 per mile, so the total cost of driving is 15,000 * 2 = $30,000.

John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus is 150 * 12 = $1,800.

Now, let's add the total cost of driving and the total bonus to find the total amount John pays a year for driving. $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The final answer is: $31,800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to add the minutes he exercised on both days. 

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined minutes by 2.

Combined minutes: 39
Twice the combined minutes: 39 * 2 = 78 minutes

So, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

When you fold a piece of paper, you get two pages. The first page is the front, and the second page is the back. 

So, if you have a 32-page tabloid, you would need 32 pages. But since each piece of paper gives you two pages, you would need half of 32 pages. 

32 / 2 = 16 

So, you would need 16 pieces of paper to make a 32-page tabloid.

"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to first find out how much she spent on food and snacks. She spent half of her $50 on food and snacks, so that's 50 / 2 = 25 dollars. 

Then, she spent an additional $10 on rides. So, the total amount she spent is 25 + 10 = 35 dollars.

Now, we need to subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount she had. So, 50 - 35 = 15 dollars.

The final answer is: $15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Elise sold 45 books this year. We also know that she sold twice as many books in the first year as she did in the current year. So, in the first year, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books.

We also know that she has sold a total of 250 - 50 = 200 books in the first two years. We already know that she sold 90 books in the first year, so she must have sold 200 - 90 = 110 books in the second year.

Since each book sells for $20, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 110 * 20 = $2200.

The final answer is: $2200"
"To find out how much money Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his job and his bonus.

Watson works 10 hours a day, 5 days a week. So, he works 10 x 5 = 50 hours a week.

Since there are 4 weeks in April, Watson works a total of 50 x 4 = 200 hours in April.

Watson earns $10 per hour, so his total earnings from his job in April are 200 x $10 = $2000.

He also gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. Since the company performed well for the whole month, he gets a bonus for 4 weeks, which is 4 x $300 = $1200.

So, his total earnings in April are $2000 + $1200 = $3200.

The final answer is: $3200"
"To find out how many people John lost to, we need to find out how many people he beat and then subtract that from the total number of people he arm wrestled.

John arm wrestled 20 people and beat 80% of them. To find 80% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.8.

20 x 0.8 = 16

So John beat 16 people. To find out how many people he lost to, we subtract 16 from the total number of people he arm wrestled.

20 - 16 = 4

John lost to 4 people."
"To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we need to first find out how many loaves are left after selling in the morning. 

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 

Two-thirds of 60 is 2/3 * 60 = 40 loaves. 

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning. 

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left. 

60 - 40 = 20 loaves are left. 

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. 

Half of 20 is 20 / 2 = 10 loaves. 

So, 10 loaves are sold in the afternoon.

"To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we need to know how much weight Joey loses in a week. 

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight Joey loses in a week, we need to divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks. 

Weight lost per week by Joey = Total weight lost / Number of weeks
Weight lost per week by Joey = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weight lost per week by Joey = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, it will take Sandy 4 * 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

4 * 4 = 16

So, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

"To find out how much you will save, we need to first find out the total cost of the items before and after the discount.

The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream before the discount is 2 x $13 = $26. 
The cost of 4 packets of milk before the discount is 4 x $1 = $4.

So, the total cost before the discount is $26 + $4 = $30.

The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream after the discount is 2 x $11 = $22.
The cost of 4 packets of milk after the discount is 4 x ($1 - $0.5) = 4 x $0.5 = $2.

So, the total cost after the discount is $22 + $2 = $24.

To find out how much you will save, we need to subtract the total cost after the discount from the total cost before the discount. 

$30 - $24 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many extra arms Helena's serum will cause a person to grow. Since the person grows an extra arm every three days, we can divide 15 days by 3 to find out how many times the person will grow an extra arm. 

15 ÷ 3 = 5

So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

Next, we need to find out how many extra legs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow. Since the person grows an extra leg every five days, we can divide 15 days by 5 to find out how many times the person will grow an extra leg.

15 ÷ 5 = 3

So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

Now, we need to find the total number of new limbs. To do this, we add the number of extra arms and the number of extra legs.

5 (extra arms) + 3 (extra legs) = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each. 
   Cost of suits = 6 * $100 = $600

2. He buys 3 suitcases at $50 each.
   Cost of suitcases = 3 * $50 = $150

3. The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit.
   Cost of a business suit = $100
   5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
   Cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200

4. Total cost so far = Cost of suits + Cost of suitcases + Cost of flight ticket
   Total cost so far = $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

5. Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip.
   Total money he has = $6000
   Money left after saving = $6000 - $2000 = $4000

6. Money left after buying essentials = Total money he has - Total cost so far
   Money left after buying essentials = $4000 - $1950 = $2050

7. Money left for buying gifts = Money left after buying essentials
   Money left for buying gifts = $2050

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Let's say the number of players on the defense is x. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is x/2.

The total number of players is 105, which is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. 

So, we can write the equation: x + 2x + x/2 = 105.

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying the whole numbers by 2, so the equation becomes 2x + 4x + x = 210.

Combine like terms: 7x = 210.

Now, divide both sides by 7: x = 30.

Now, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. That leaves 24 - 8 = 16 people.

Then, 1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments. 1/4 of 8 is 8 / 4 = 2. So, 2 people had previous commitments. That leaves 16 - 2 = 14 people.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total marbles in the store now is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. So, his father gave him 8 marbles.

Now, the total marbles in the store is 70 + 8 = 78.

Each marble weighs 2kgs. To find the total weight of marbles, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble. 

Total weight = 78 * 2 = 156 kgs.

Girls = 3 * 30 = 90

Next, we know there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys. To find the number of nongendered children, we can multiply the number of boys by 1/10. 
Nongendered children = 30 * (1/10) = 3

Now, we need to find the total number of children in the classroom. To do this, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children together. 
Total children = 30 (boys) + 90 (girls) + 3 (nongendered children) = 123

Let's say the number of poles is x. Then, the number of wires is 3x. We are given that the total number of wires is 45. So, we can set up the equation 3x = 45.

To find x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 3. 

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to find the total number of people at the party. We know there were 25 men and 15 women. 

Total number of people = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

Now, 1/4 of the total number of people left the party. To find 1/4 of 40, we multiply 40 by 1/4.

1/4 of 40 = 40 * 1/4 = 10 people left

So, 10 people left the party. We know 22 men stayed, so the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3 men.

Since 10 people left and 3 of them were men, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7 women.

Now, we know there were 15 women initially and 7 women left. To find the number of women who stayed, we subtract 7 from 15.

Number of women who stayed = 15 - 7 = 8 women

Cost of magazine = $4 / 2
Cost of magazine = $2

Now, we know the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. So, we can find the cost of the pen by subtracting $1 from the cost of the magazine.

Cost of pen = Cost of magazine - $1
Cost of pen = $2 - $1
Cost of pen = $1

"Let's start by finding out how many pencils Jam has in total. We know she has 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils, and together they make 26 pencils. 

Let's say the number of pencils in each box is x. Then, 3x + 2 = 26. 

To find x, we need to subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: 3x = 26 - 2, 3x = 24. 

Now, we need to divide both sides by 3 to find x: x = 24 / 3, x = 8. 

So, Jam has 8 pencils in each box. 

Now, let's find out how many pencils Jam has in total. She has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each, so 3 * 8 = 24 pencils. And she also has 2 loose pencils, so 24 + 2 = 26 pencils.

Now, let's add Jam's pencils to Meg's pencils: 26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72 pencils.

To find out how many boxes they need, we need to divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils in each box: 72 / 8 = 9.

"To find out how many milliliters weaker the coffee is, we need to calculate the total weakening effect of the ice cubes and the cream.

Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. Since the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, we need to find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool it by 65 degrees. 

Let's assume the initial temperature of the coffee is 100 degrees (for simplicity). We need to find the number of ice cubes that will cool it down to 35 degrees (100 - 65 = 35). 

Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can divide 65 by 13 to find the number of ice cubes: 65 / 13 = 5. 

Now, we know that 5 ice cubes will cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes will make it 5 x 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Shannon also adds 15 milliliters of cream, which weakens the coffee. So, the total weakening effect is 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to find out how many junior and senior programmers there are, and then multiply that by their respective salaries.

First, let's find out how many junior programmers there are. We know that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees. 

Total employees = 100
Junior programmers = 2/5 * 100 = 40

Since there are 100 employees in total, and 40 are junior programmers, the remaining employees are senior programmers.

Senior programmers = Total employees - Junior programmers
Senior programmers = 100 - 40
Senior programmers = 60

Now, we know that senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers. Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month, so senior programmers are paid $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month.

Total amount = (Junior programmers * Junior programmer's salary) + (Senior programmers * Senior programmer's salary)
Total amount = (40 * $2000) + (60 * $2400)
Total amount = $80000 + $144000
Total amount = $184000

"To find out how long it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to know how many percentage points it needs to charge. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs to charge 100% - 60% = 40% more.

Since it charges 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we need to find out how many 3-minute intervals are in 40%. 

To do this, we divide 40 by 1 (since it charges 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes). 

40 / 1 = 40

So, it needs 40 intervals of 3 minutes each to charge 40%. 

Now, we multiply the number of intervals by the time per interval to find the total time in minutes. 

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

120 / 60 = 2 hours

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

Now, they used these rewards on this shopping trip. They spent $43 and used their rewards. So, they got $43 - $4 = $39 left to pay.

Then, they applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Twice the amount of rewards is 2 x $4 = $8. So, they got $8 off their purchase. 

Now, we subtract the discount from the remaining amount: $39 - $8 = $31.

"To find out which job pays more, we need to calculate the net pay for each job.

For Job A, Nick works 2000 hours a year at $15 an hour. 

First, we find the total income: 2000 hours * $15/hour = $30,000.

Then, we calculate the total tax: $30,000 * 20% = $30,000 * 0.2 = $6,000.

The net pay for Job A is: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

For Job B, the total income is $42,000. 

First, we subtract the property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000.

Then, we calculate the tax on the net income: $36,000 * 10% = $36,000 * 0.1 = $3,600.

The net pay for Job B is: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs. Job A pays $24,000 and Job B pays $32,400. 

Since $32,400 is more than $24,000, Job B pays more.

To find out how much more Nick will make at Job B compared to Job A, we subtract the net pay of Job A from the net pay of Job B: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

For the suckers, Mason needs 30 ounces per batch. He wants to make 8 batches, so we multiply 30 ounces by 8.

30 ounces/batch * 8 batches = 240 ounces

For the fudge, Mason needs 70 ounces per batch. He wants to make 1 batch, so we multiply 70 ounces by 1.

70 ounces/batch * 1 batch = 70 ounces

Now, we add the total amount of sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge.

First, Maria buys 8 shares for $8 each. So, the total cost of the shares is 8 * 8 = $64.

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price, we need to calculate 50% of the original price and add it to the original price. 50% of $8 is 0.5 * 8 = $4. So, the new price is 8 + 4 = $12.

Now, Maria has 8 shares at a price of $12 each. The total value of her shares is 8 * 12 = $96.

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. To find the new price, we need to calculate 25% of the current price and subtract it from the current price. 25% of $12 is 0.25 * 12 = $3. So, the new price is 12 - 3 = $9.

Now, Maria has 8 shares at a price of $9 each. The total value of her shares is 8 * 9 = $72.

"Let's say the number of students in the two equal groups is x. The smallest group has 10 less students than each of the other groups, so it has x - 10 students.

Since the total number of students is 200, we can set up the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

So, the two equal groups have 70 students each. The smallest group has x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 students.

Combine like terms: 3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3: x = 20

So, the number of cows is 20 and the number of chickens is 2x = 2 * 20 = 40.

Now, let's count the legs. Cows have 4 legs and chickens have 2 legs. 

The total number of legs of the cows is 20 * 4 = 80.

Now, Josh drops 3 balls, but 2 are caught by the crowd. That means 1 ball is lost. 

6 (initial balls) - 3 (dropped balls) = 3 balls left
3 (balls left) - 2 (caught by the crowd) = 1 ball left

Josh starts to juggle with 1 ball."
"Let's break down the information given:

- The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
- The pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle and a green toad, so they also weigh 50 pounds.
- The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
- The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all the animals and the container:

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

The final answer is: 260"

"To find out how many meters Tyson will run in a day, we need to multiply 5000 by 1/5. 

5000 * 1/5 = 1000

So, Tyson will run 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters every day.

There are 30 days in June. 

To find the total distance covered in June, we multiply the daily distance by the number of days in June.

6000 * 30 = 180,000

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Juice Box A is 4 dollars. 
Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it's 4 + 5 = 9 dollars. 
Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it's 4 + 7 = 11 dollars. 

Now, we need to find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B. 
To do that, we need to subtract the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C. 
So, 11 (price of Juice Box C) - 9 (price of Juice Box B) = 2.

"To find the total number of legs, we need to multiply the number of tables with 4 legs by 4 and the number of tables with 3 legs by 3, then add the two results together.

First, let's multiply the number of tables with 4 legs by 4: 40 * 4 = 160

Next, let's multiply the number of tables with 3 legs by 3: 50 * 3 = 150

Now, let's add the two results together: 160 + 150 = 310

The total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310."
"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to know how many cookies are left after her son and husband eat their cookies. 

First, let's find out how many cookies her son eats in a week. He eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so that's 4 x 5 = 20 cookies.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so that's 1 x 7 = 7 cookies.

Now, let's add the cookies her son and husband eat: 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since there are 36 cookies in a bag, and 27 are eaten by her son and husband, that means 36 - 27 = 9 cookies are left.

Jenny eats the rest of the cookies, which is 9 cookies.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much Davos paid for the 2 shirts, we need to first find the discount amount. 

The original price of 2 shirts is 2 x $30 = $60. 

The discount is 40% of $60. To find 40% of $60, we multiply $60 by 0.4. 

$60 x 0.4 = $24. 

So, the discount amount is $24. 

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the amount Davos paid. 

$60 - $24 = $36.

So, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the percentage more they are making per day now, we need to first find out how much they made per day when they made tractors and how much they make per day now when they make silos.

When they made tractors, they sold 10 tractors a day and made $100 per tractor. So, they made 10 x $100 = $1000 per day.

Now, they sell 5 silos a day, and make $220 per silo. So, they make 5 x $220 = $1100 per day.

To find the percentage more they are making per day now, we need to find the difference between the two amounts and divide it by the original amount, then multiply by 100.

The difference is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

Now, we divide the difference by the original amount: $100 / $1000 = 0.1.

Finally, we multiply by 100 to get the percentage: 0.1 x 100 = 10%.

So, they are making 10% more per day now. 

10%"
"To find out how much Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to first find out how much she spends per month. 

Food costs $25 per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the cost of food by 4 to get the monthly cost. 
$25 * 4 = $100 per month for food.

Treats cost $20 per month.

Medicine costs $100 per month.

Now, we add up the costs of food, treats, and medicine to get the total monthly cost. 
$100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220 per month.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 to get the yearly cost. 
$220 * 12 = $2640 per year.

The final answer is: $2640"
"To find the total hours of Peyton's after-work activities, we need to add up the hours of each activity.

On Monday, Peyton has a one hour yoga class. 
On Tuesday, Peyton has a cooking class that lasts three times as long as Monday's yoga, so it's 1 * 3 = 3 hours.
On Wednesday, Peyton has a half-hour cheese-tasting event, which is 0.5 hours.
On Thursday, Peyton has a museum tour that takes half as long as the cooking class, so it's 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours.
On Friday, Peyton has two hours of errands.

Now, let's add up the hours of all the activities: 
1 (Monday) + 3 (Tuesday) + 0.5 (Wednesday) + 1.5 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 7.5

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Andrea started with $36. She spent $11 on a sweater and gave her brother $4. To find out how much she spent in total, we need to add the cost of the sweater and the money she gave her brother. 

$11 (sweater) + $4 (given to brother) = $15

Now, we need to subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount she had. 

$36 (initial amount) - $15 (total spent) = $21

So, Andrea saved $21.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

John spent 6 hours boating. He spent half that time swimming, so he spent 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming.

He watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so he spent 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows.

The total time he spent boating, swimming, and watching shows is 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

This was 30% of the total time he spent, so the total time he spent is 15 / 0.3 = 50 hours.

He spent 40% of his time sightseeing, so the time he spent sightseeing is 0.4 * 50 = 20 hours.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Annabelle already has $80 in her savings. 

At her first job, she earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours. So, she earns $10 x 20 = $200 from her first job.

At her second job, she earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours. So, she earns $5 x 15 = $75 from her second job.

Now, let's add the money she earned from both jobs: $200 + $75 = $275.

To find out how much money Annabelle has in total, we add the money she earned to the money she already had: $275 + $80 = $355.

Since the phone costs $400, we need to subtract the total money Annabelle has from the cost of the phone to find out how much more she needs to save: $400 - $355 = $45.

The final answer is: $45"

The shortest tree is 6 feet tall. The second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so it's 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall. 

Now, we need to find the combined height of the two trees. The shortest tree is 6 feet tall, and the second tree is 11 feet tall. So, 6 + 11 = 17 feet. 

The tallest tree's height is twice the height of the two trees combined, which is 2 * 17 = 34 feet. 

The tallest tree is 34 feet tall.

He also bought 5 teddy bears for $1 each, so that's 5 x $1 = $5. 

The total amount he spent is $12 + $5 = $17. 

Now, let's subtract the amount he spent from the initial amount: $28 - $17 = $11. 

His mother gave him an extra $10, so we add that to the amount he had left: $11 + $10 = $21.

"Let's break down the costs. 

- Mini-golf costs $5 per person, and Morgan also wants to play, so that's 2 people. The cost for mini-golf is 2 * $5 = $10.
- Arcade tokens cost $5 in total.
- Go-karts cost $10 per ride, and Morgan and her friends will ride twice, so that's 2 * $10 = $20.
- The total cost for mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-karts is $10 + $5 + $20 = $35.

Morgan has a budget of $90. To find out how many friends she can invite, we need to subtract the total cost from her budget. 

$90 - $35 = $55

Since Morgan also needs to play, we need to subtract 1 from the remaining budget to find out how many friends she can invite. 

$55 - $5 = $50

$50 can be divided by $5 (the cost of mini-golf per person) to find out how many friends she can invite.

$50 / $5 = 10

"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, Billy has $10 to spend on candy. The candy costs $1.5 a pound. 

To find out how many pounds of candy he can buy, we need to divide the money he has by the cost of the candy per pound. 

$10 / $1.5 = 6.67 pounds of candy. 

Since you can't buy a fraction of a pound, we'll round down to 6 pounds of candy. 

Now, let's find out how much change Billy gets after buying the candy. 

6 pounds of candy costs 6 x $1.5 = $9. 

$10 - $9 = $1. 

Billy takes half of his change, which is $1 / 2 = $0.5. 

He spends this $0.5 on gumballs that cost $0.05 each. 

To find out how many gumballs he bought, we divide the money he spent on gumballs by the cost of each gumball. 

$0.5 / $0.05 = 10 gumballs. 

However, we know he bought 40 gumballs, so this information is not needed to find the pounds of candy he bought. 

The answer is 6."
"Let's break it down. If Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, we can write an equation to represent this relationship. Let's say the son's age is x. 

The equation would be: Carver's age = 2x - 5
We know Carver is 45 years old, so we can plug that in: 45 = 2x - 5

Now, we need to solve for x. To do that, we add 5 to both sides of the equation: 45 + 5 = 2x - 5 + 5
This simplifies to: 50 = 2x

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to find x: 50 / 2 = 2x / 2
This simplifies to: 25 = x

So, the son is 25 years old.

"To find out how many miles the train travels in one trip, we need to add the distances between the cities. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles. 
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. 
The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two, which is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. 
So, the distance from the third city to the first city is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

Now, we add the distances together: 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

The train does this trip 3 times a day, so it travels 3 x 300 = 900 miles per day.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we need to divide the total miles it can travel before service by the miles it travels per day.

18,000 miles / 900 miles per day = 20 days.

"To find out how much stuffing Mark needs, we need to calculate the amount of stuffing for each type of bed and then add them up.

A bed for a Rottweiler takes 8 pounds of stuffing. 
A bed for a chihuahua takes 2 pounds of stuffing. 
A bed for a collie takes the average amount of stuffing between the first two kinds of beds. To find the average, we add the two amounts and divide by 2. 
Average stuffing for a collie bed = (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for each type of bed:
- For 4 chihuahua beds: 4 * 2 = 8 pounds
- For 3 collie beds: 3 * 5 = 15 pounds

Now, we add the total amount of stuffing needed for each type of bed: 
8 + 15 = 23 pounds

"To find the total time it took for John to get to his friend's house, we need to find the total distance and divide it by his speed. 

The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, but he had to take a detour that added 10 miles. So the total distance to his friend's house is 200 + 10 = 210 miles. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 210 miles / 70 mph
Time = 3 hours

Now, let's find the time it took for John to get back home. The distance is 240 miles and his speed is 80 mph. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 240 miles / 80 mph
Time = 3 hours

The total time it took for John to get to his friend's house and back home is 3 + 3 = 6 hours.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Let's say the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks is x. 
We know that 3 customers were kicked out for this reason, so x = 3.

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is 4 times the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks minus 5. 
So, the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is 4x - 5. 
We know that x = 3, so the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is 4(3) - 5 = 7.

The number of customers kicked out for physical violence is 3 times the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting. 
So, the number of customers kicked out for physical violence is 3(7) = 21.

We know that a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart. 
We also know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting, and 21 customers were kicked out for physical violence.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames, the pins, and the cords separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the picture frames. Each picture frame costs $20 and there's an additional 20% cost to etch the logo. 20% of $20 is 0.2 x $20 = $4. So, the total cost of each picture frame is $20 + $4 = $24. Since there are 44 seniors, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 x $24 = $1056.

Next, 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each. So, the total cost of the pins is 2 x $5 = $10.

Now, let's find the number of officers. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so 1/4 of 44 is 11. The cost of the cords for the officers is 11 x $12 = $132.

Finally, we add the cost of the picture frames, the pins, and the cords together. $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

20% of $400 is 0.2 x 400 = $80. 

So, the cost of making the hand-painted wallpaper is $400 - $80 = $320.

The total cost is the cost of materials plus the cost of making it yourself. Since you're making it yourself, the cost of making it is 0. 

The total cost is $320."

Now, let's add up the total number of pairs sold: 14 + 28 + 14 = 56 pairs of shoes.

But, six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit, so we need to subtract those from the total: 56 - 6 = 50 pairs of shoes.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, we need to multiply the number of pairs by 2 to get the total number of shoes sold: 50 x 2 = 100 shoes.

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total interest she has to pay and then divide it by the number of months.

First, let's find the total interest she has to pay. The formula for simple interest is:

Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

In this case, the principal is $3,650, the rate is 10% or 0.10, and the time is 5 months.

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Interest = $1,825

Now, we need to add the interest to the principal to find the total amount she has to pay:

Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $3,650 + $1,825
Total Amount = $5,475

Since she has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, we divide the total amount by 5:

"To find out how much profit Millie will make per hour, we need to know how much money she makes per hour and how much she spends per hour.

First, let's find out how much money she makes per hour. She sells 4 cups of lemonade per hour and each cup costs $1, so she makes 4 x $1 = $4 per hour.

Now, let's find out how much she spends per hour. She buys supplies for $18 to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups, so she makes 3 x 12 = 36 cups of lemonade. She sells all of the lemonade, so she sells 36 cups. She makes $4 per hour, and she sells 4 cups per hour, so she sells all of the lemonade in 36 / 4 = 9 hours. She spends $18 to make 36 cups of lemonade, so she spends $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

Now, let's find out how much profit she makes per hour. She makes $4 per hour and she spends $2 per hour, so she makes a profit of $4 - $2 = $2 per hour.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's say Mr. Ruther had x hectares of land at first. He sold 3/5 of it, so he was left with 2/5 of it. We know that 2/5 of x is equal to 12.8 hectares. 

To find x, we need to solve the equation: (2/5)x = 12.8

To isolate x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2. 

(5/2) * (2/5)x = (5/2) * 12.8
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

32"
"First, we need to find out how many girls are in the choir. Since 50% of the choir are boys, the other 50% must be girls. 

50% of 52 is 26. So, there are 26 girls in the choir.

Now, the choir decides to perform with just its female members. But, half the people performing can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down. Half of 26 is 13. So, 13 girls can't make it to the show.

Now, there are 26 - 13 = 13 girls left to perform.

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is 13 + 3 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to add up all his test scores and then divide by the number of tests. 

First, let's add up his test scores: 
65 + 94 = 159
159 + 81 = 240
240 + 86 = 326
326 + 74 = 400

Now, we divide the total by the number of tests, which is 5.
400 / 5 = 80

So, Wilson's current math grade is 80. 

80"
"To find the total cost, we need to multiply the cost of each item by the number of items and then add them together.

The cost of 6 erasers is 6 x $2 = $12.

"To find out how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu, we need to calculate 1/3 of 66. 

1/3 of 66 is 66 / 3 = 22. 

So, James delivers 66 + 22 messages to Mr. Yu and Ms. Thompson. 

66 + 22 = 88

The final answer is: 88"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much it would cost Dasha to buy 9 ride tickets. Each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, so the cost of one ride is 2 x $2 = $4. 

To find the total cost for 9 rides, we multiply the cost of one ride by 9: $4 x 9 = $36.

Now, we know that David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides. 

Since they both ride all 9 rides, David and Dasha will spend the same amount on rides. 

The cost for Dasha is $36, and the cost for David is $30. 

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract the cost for David from the cost for Dasha: $36 - $30 = $6.

"Let's break it down. The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. 

Let's say the number of popsicles Betty has is 5x and the number of popsicles Sam has is 6x. 

We know that the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. So, 5x + 6x = 165. 

Combine like terms: 11x = 165. 

Divide both sides by 11: x = 15. 

Now that we know x is 15, we can find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam have. Betty has 5x = 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles. Sam has 6x = 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how much Tim saves, we need to first find out how much he pays for the streaming services. 

Netflix costs $10 a month. 

Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but he saves 20% for bundling. 20% of $10 is 0.2 x 10 = $2. So, he saves $2 on each of the services. 

The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus together is $10 + $10 = $20. He saves $2 on each, so he pays $20 - $2 = $18 for both services. 

So, the total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $18 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $28. 

He saves $60 (cable package) - $28 (streaming services) = $32. 

The final answer is: $32"
"To find the total time Carol spent, we need to add up the time she spent writing, recording, and editing the song. 

She spent 4 hours writing the song. 
She spent half of that time recording the song, which is 4 / 2 = 2 hours. 
She spent 90 minutes editing the song. We need to convert this to hours, so 90 minutes is 1.5 hours. 

Now, let's add up the time: 4 hours (writing) + 2 hours (recording) + 1.5 hours (editing) = 7.5 hours.

To find the percentage of time she spent editing, we need to divide the time she spent editing by the total time and multiply by 100. 

Time spent editing / Total time = (1.5 / 7.5) * 100 = 20%

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many books Wendy needs, we first need to find out how many books are already in the shelving system. Since it has 6 rows and 6 columns, we multiply the number of rows by the number of columns to get the total number of books.

6 rows * 6 columns = 36 books

Now, Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in the shelving system. To find out how many books she needs to double the number of books, we multiply the current number of books by 2.

36 books * 2 = 72 books

Then, we add 20 more books to the doubled number of books.

72 books + 20 books = 92 books

So, Wendy will need 92 books to complete her task.

The final answer is: 92"
"Let's break it down step by step. Erica started with 20 cards. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards that had 15 cards each, so she got 2 x 15 = 30 more cards. Now she has 20 + 30 = 50 cards. 

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so she gave away 24 + 5 = 29 cards. Now she has 50 - 29 = 21 cards left. 

Then, she received 17 cards from family and friends. So now she has 21 + 17 = 38 cards. 

The final answer is: 38"
"To find out how many slices Jenny gave to Bill and Mark, we need to add the fractions of slices they got. 

First, we need to find a common denominator for 3 and 4. The least common multiple of 3 and 4 is 12. 

Now, we convert 1/3 and 1/4 to fractions with a denominator of 12. 

1/3 = 4/12 (multiply numerator and denominator by 4)
1/4 = 3/12 (multiply numerator and denominator by 3)

Now we add the fractions: 4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12

Jenny gave 7/12 of the pizza to Bill and Mark. Since the pizza has 12 slices, we multiply 7/12 by 12 to find out how many slices they got. 

7/12 * 12 = 7 slices

Jenny ate 2 slices, so we subtract 2 from the total number of slices. 

12 - 7 - 2 = 3

$300 ÷ $10 = 30

So, Mark has to save his money for 30 days to buy the bike.

30"
"To find the total number of bugs, we need to find the number of millipedes and stink bugs first.

Nancy saw 90 spiders. The number of millipedes is 1/3rd as many as spiders, so we multiply 90 by 1/3.

90 * (1/3) = 30 millipedes

The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. We multiply 30 by 2 and then subtract 12.

30 * 2 = 60
60 - 12 = 48 stink bugs

Now, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs to find the total number of bugs.

90 (spiders) + 30 (millipedes) + 48 (stink bugs) = 168

The final answer is: 168"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know Erica is 30 years old. 

Since Beth is 5 years older than Erica, we add 5 to Erica's age to find Beth's age. 
Beth's age = Erica's age + 5
Beth's age = 30 + 5
Beth's age = 35

Now, we know Alice is 7 years older than Beth. 
Alice's age = Beth's age + 7
Alice's age = 35 + 7
Alice's age = 42

To find the difference between Alice and Erica's ages, we subtract Erica's age from Alice's age. 
Difference = Alice's age - Erica's age
Difference = 42 - 30
Difference = 12

"To find out how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we need to multiply the amount of each ingredient by 4 since he's making a quadruple batch.

For flour, he needs 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups. Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, he needs to buy 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour.

For milk, he needs 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups. Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, he needs to buy 4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour: 6 bags - 2 bottles = 4.

"To find out how much energy Mel uses in a day, we need to multiply the power of the air conditioner (in watts) by the number of hours it's used. 

Power of the air conditioner = 900 watts
Hours used per day = 8 hours

Energy used per day = Power of the air conditioner * Hours used per day
Energy used per day = 900 watts * 8 hours
Energy used per day = 7200 watt-hours or 7.2 kilowatt-hours (kWh)

If Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, he will use it for 3 hours a day.

New energy used per day = Power of the air conditioner * New hours used per day
New energy used per day = 900 watts * 3 hours
New energy used per day = 2700 watt-hours or 2.7 kWh

Now, let's find the difference in energy used per day.
Difference in energy used per day = Energy used per day - New energy used per day
Difference in energy used per day = 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh
Difference in energy used per day = 4.5 kWh

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the difference in energy used per day by 30.

Total energy saved in 30 days = Difference in energy used per day * 30
Total energy saved in 30 days = 4.5 kWh * 30
Total energy saved in 30 days = 135 kWh

"To find the average number of stripes, we need to add up all the stripes and divide by the number of zebras.

First, let's find the total number of stripes on the two zebras with 17 stripes each. 
2 zebras * 17 stripes = 34 stripes

Then, we add the stripes of the zebra with 36 stripes.
34 stripes + 36 stripes = 70 stripes

Next, we find the number of stripes on the zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes. 
Half of 36 is 18 stripes.

Now, we add the stripes of the zebra with 18 stripes.
70 stripes + 18 stripes = 88 stripes

There are a total of 4 zebras. 
88 stripes / 4 zebras = 22 stripes

"To find out how much money Tyson would spend, we need to figure out how many sandwiches he needs to make and how much meat and cheese he needs for those sandwiches.

Since each sandwich serves 4 people and there are 20 people in total, we need to divide 20 by 4 to find out how many sandwiches Tyson needs to make. 

20 / 4 = 5

So, Tyson needs to make 5 sandwiches. 

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, so Tyson needs 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The meat costs $7.00 per pound, so 5 pounds of meat will cost 5 x $7.00 = $35.00.

The cheese costs $3.00 per pound, so 5 pounds of cheese will cost 5 x $3.00 = $15.00.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese.

$35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

"To find out how many minutes Toby will be early, we need to know how long it will take him to read the book. 

First, we need to find out how many words are in the book. Since the book is 45 pages long and it averages 200 words a page, we multiply 45 by 200.

45 * 200 = 9000 words

Now, we know Toby can read 300 words per minute. To find out how many minutes it will take him to read the book, we divide the total number of words by his reading speed.

9000 / 300 = 30 minutes

It takes 30 minutes to read the book. Toby has to leave as soon as he finishes the book and it takes 10 minutes to get to the airport. So, we add 10 minutes to the time it takes to read the book.

30 + 10 = 40 minutes

Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, and it will take him 40 minutes to get there after he finishes the book. To find out how many minutes early he will be, we subtract 40 from 60.

60 - 40 = 20 minutes

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately and then add them together.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked for 40 hours a week and was paid $15 per hour. So, the total amount paid to each employee in May is 40 hours * $15 per hour = $600. 

Since there are 4 weeks in May, the total amount paid to each employee in May is $600 * 4 = $2400. 

The total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 employees * $2400 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 of 40 employees = 10 employees left. So, there are 40 - 10 = 30 employees left in June.

The total amount paid to each employee in June is the same as in May, which is $600 per week. Since there are 4 weeks in June, the total amount paid to each employee in June is $600 * 4 = $2400.

The total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 employees * $2400 = $72,000.

The total amount paid to all employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

"First, we need to find out how much Tim spent on the two packs of fireworks. The first pack is $400, and the second pack is twice that much, so it's 2 x $400 = $800. 

So, the total cost of the two packs is $400 + $800 = $1200. 

Then, Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packs. To find 20% of $1200, we multiply $1200 by 0.2, which is $240. 

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost of the two packs: $1200 - $240 = $960. 

Next, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150. 

So, the total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

She eats 2 cookies a night, and there are 30 days in 30 days. So, she eats 2 cookies * 30 days = 60 cookies in 30 days.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she needs (60) by the number of cookies her recipe makes (12).

60 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5 dozen cookies.

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To find the number of candles that smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the number of candles that smell like wet dog and multiply it by the percentage that might explode.

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. 5% of 50000 candles smell like wet dog. 

5% of 50000 = 0.05 * 50000 = 2500 candles

Now, we need to find the number of candles that smell like wet dog and might explode. Since 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, 1% might explode. 

1% of the candles that smell like wet dog might explode. 

1% of 2500 = 0.01 * 2500 = 25 candles

So, 25 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

Let's say Joanne gathered x apples from the average trees. 

Since Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees and her sister gathered twice as many, her sister gathered 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.

Joanne gathered half the amount from the shortest trees as she did from the tallest trees, so she gathered 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees. Her sister gathered 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so she gathered 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

The total number of apples Joanne gathered is 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + x (average) = 45 + x.

The total number of apples her sister gathered is 60 (tallest) + 45 (shortest) = 105.

Since they gathered a combined total of 500 apples, we can write the equation: 45 + x + 105 = 500.

Now, let's solve for x. 

45 + x + 105 = 500
x + 150 = 500
x = 350

"Let's say the number of camels is C and the number of dromedaries is D. We know that camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump. 

We are given that there are 304 bumps in total. Since each camel has 2 humps, the total number of humps from camels is 2C. Since each dromedary has 1 hump, the total number of humps from dromedaries is D. 

We can write an equation based on this information: 2C + D = 304.

We are also given that there are 180 heads in total. Since each camel and dromedary has one head, the total number of heads is C + D. 

We can write another equation based on this information: C + D = 180.

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for C and D by solving the system of equations.

First, we can multiply the second equation by 2 to get 2C + 2D = 360.

Now we can subtract the first equation from this new equation to get 2D - D = 360 - 304, which simplifies to D = 56.

So, there are 56 dromedaries."
"To find the total distance Tom traveled, we need to break it down into parts.

First, let's find the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days. He traveled 200 kilometers every day for 4 days, so the total distance is 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.

Next, let's find the distance Tom traveled over the next two days. He traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers. Since this is for 2 days, we multiply by 2, so the total distance for these two days is 240 * 2 = 480 kilometers.

Now, let's add the distance Tom didn't travel (0 kilometers) on the next day.

During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day for 7 days. So, the total distance for the second week is 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, let's add up all the distances: 800 + 480 + 0 + 2100 = 2380 kilometers.

"First, we need to find out how many cats were taken away by the boats. There were 4 boats and each boat took 5 cats, so we multiply 4 by 5 to get 20 cats taken away. 

Now, we subtract 20 from the original 50 cats to find out how many cats are left. 50 - 20 = 30 cats.

Then, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after the mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3 and then divide by 5. 

30 * 3 = 90, and 90 / 5 = 18. 

So, 18 cats ran after the mouse. Now, we need to subtract 18 from the remaining cats to find out how many are left. 

30 - 18 = 12 cats.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, Bill paid $8 a month for the first 6 months. That's 6 x $8 = $48.

Then, he paid the normal price of $12 a month for 8 months. That's 8 x $12 = $96.

After that, the price went up to $14 a month. Since 2 years is 24 months, and he already paid for 6 + 8 = 14 months, he has 24 - 14 = 10 months left at the new price. That's 10 x $14 = $140.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

The final answer is: $284"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. So, if the tattered jeans cost $28, the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

He saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. This means he saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans and 2/3 of the savings from the tattered jeans.

Let's say the savings from the jogger jeans is x. Then, the savings from the tattered jeans is 2x.

We know that the total savings is $6. So, x + 2x = 6. 

Combine like terms: 3x = 6.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 2.

So, the savings from the jogger jeans is $2 and the savings from the tattered jeans is 2x = 2 * 2 = $4.

The jogger jeans cost $22 and the tattered jeans cost $28. The difference is $28 - $22 = $6.

The jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to add up the capacity of all the buses, minibusses, and minivans.

First, let's find out how many employees the buses can hold: 4 buses * 60 employees per bus = 240 employees.

Next, let's find out how many employees the minibusses can hold: 6 minibusses * 30 employees per minibus = 180 employees.

Lastly, let's find out how many employees the minivans can hold: 10 minivans * 15 employees per minivan = 150 employees.

Now, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles: 240 employees + 180 employees + 150 employees = 570 employees.

The final answer is: 570"
"Let's break this down step by step. Lillian made 3 bird feeders and bought 3. So, in total, she has 3 + 3 = 6 bird feeders.

The store-bought bird feeders attract 20 birds each day. The bird feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each day.

Since there are 3 store-bought bird feeders, they attract 3 x 20 = 60 birds each day. And since there are 3 bird feeders Lillian made herself, they attract 3 x 30 = 90 birds each day.

To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we add the number of birds attracted by the store-bought bird feeders and the number of birds attracted by the bird feeders Lillian made herself: 60 + 90 = 150.

The final answer is: 150"
"To find out how much Aleksandra paid, we need to calculate the cost of each item. 

The bagel costs $4. 
The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find 25% of $4, we multiply $4 by 0.25, which is $1. Then we add $1 to $4, so the soup costs $5. 

The cake costs half of the price of the bagel. To find half of $4, we divide $4 by 2, which is $2.

Now we add up the cost of all the items: $4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

The final answer is: $11"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

Kenny has $50 in spending cash and he needs $100 to go to the amusement park. So, he needs $100 - $50 = $50 more to buy the ticket.

He plans to sell his cards for $1.5 each. To find out how many cards he needs to sell, we divide the amount he needs ($50) by the price of each card ($1.5). 

$50 / $1.5 = 33.33

Since Kenny can't sell a fraction of a card, we round down to 33 cards. This is the number of cards he needs to sell to get the remaining $50.

We know that Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards, so the number of cards he sells is 2/3 of the total number of cards he started with. Let's call the total number of cards he started with 'x'. 

2/3 * x = 33

To find 'x', we multiply both sides by 3/2.

x = 33 * (3/2)
x = 49.5

Since Kenny can't have a fraction of a card, we round up to 50 cards."
"So, the caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests, but half of them would have 2 hotdogs. That means 36 / 2 = 18 guests would have 2 hotdogs. The other half, which is also 18 guests, would have 1 hotdog. 

So, the caterer prepared 18 * 2 + 18 * 1 = 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

But then, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. That means 40 guests had 2 hotdogs, so 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs were eaten.

Since the caterer only had 54 hotdogs, that means 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs were not enough. But we need to find out how many guests did not get a second hotdog. 

We know that 40 guests had 2 hotdogs, and there were originally 36 guests. So, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 36 - 40 = -4. But that can't be right, because you can't have a negative number of guests. 

Let's think about it this way: the caterer prepared for 36 guests, but 40 showed up. That means 40 - 36 = 4 extra guests showed up. These 4 extra guests must have eaten the extra hotdogs that the other guests didn't get. 

So, the 4 extra guests must have eaten the 26 hotdogs that were not enough. Since they each had 2 hotdogs, that means 4 * 2 = 8 hotdogs were eaten by the extra guests.

The other guests, who were originally 36, must have eaten the remaining hotdogs. Since 8 hotdogs were eaten by the extra guests, that means 54 - 8 = 46 hotdogs were eaten by the original 36 guests.

We know that 18 of the original 36 guests had 2 hotdogs, so they ate 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs. The other 18 guests had 1 hotdog each, so they ate 18 * 1 = 18 hotdogs.

The total number of hotdogs eaten by the original 36 guests is 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs. But we know that 46 hotdogs were eaten by the original 36 guests, so that means 54 - 46 = 8 hotdogs were not eaten by the original 36 guests.

Since 8 hotdogs were not eaten by the original 36 guests, that means 8 hotdogs were eaten by the 4 extra guests. But we already know that the 4 extra guests ate 8 hotdogs, so that's correct.

The 8 hotdogs that were not eaten by the original 36 guests must have been eaten by the 4 extra guests. Since the 4 extra guests had 2 hotdogs each, that means 4 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to find half of the letters in Indras' name. Indras has 6 letters, so half of that is 6 / 2 = 3.

Now, we need to find out how many letters are in her sister's name. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Now, we need to add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name. 6 (Indras) + 7 (sister) = 13.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to first find the total cost of the items before the discount. 

The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00. 
The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00. 
The cost of the 5 separate utensils is 5 x $5.00 = $25.00. 

So, the total cost of the items before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Now, we need to find 20% of $165.00 to calculate the discount. 
20% of $165.00 is 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final cost. 
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

The final answer is: $132.00"
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we need to add up the cost of the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball. 

The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. 

6 + 11 + 2 = 19

Dora has $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother, so she has a total of $2 + $16 = $18.

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we need to subtract the money she has from the total cost of the items.

19 - 18 = 1

So, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons. 
Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, so he slew 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons. 
Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so he slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons. 
Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so he slew 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

"To find out how much gas Josey needed, we first need to find out how much gas is in one container. 

15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 different containers. So, to find out how much gas is in one container, we need to divide 15 by 5.

15 ÷ 5 = 3 gallons

Now, we know that Josey needed 1/4 of a container to run her lawnmower. Since one container has 3 gallons, we need to find 1/4 of 3 gallons.

1/4 of 3 gallons is 3/4. To find 3/4 of 3 gallons, we multiply 3 by 3 and then divide by 4.

3 * 3 = 9
9 ÷ 4 = 2.25 gallons

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon. 

2.25 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 18 pints

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left, which means he spent 99% of his money. 

Since 1% of his money is 1/100 of his money, 99% of his money is 99/100 of his money. 

We can set up an equation to find out how much money George had initially. Let's call the initial amount of money George had ""x"". 

The equation is: 99/100 * x = 5

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 100/99. 

x = 5 * 100/99
x = 5.05

Now that we know George had $5.05 initially, we can find out how much he spent on chips. He bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each. 

The total amount spent on chips is: 3 * 0.40 = 1.20

Now, we subtract the amount spent on chips from the initial amount to find out how much he spent on candy bars. 

Amount spent on candy bars = Initial amount - Amount spent on chips
= 5.05 - 1.20
= 3.85

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can find out how many candy bars he bought by dividing the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar. 

Number of candy bars = Amount spent on candy bars / Cost of one candy bar
= 3.85 / 0.75
= 5.13

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to the nearest whole number. 

Number of candy bars = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to subtract the lollipops he kept from the total and then divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends.

Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5, so we subtract 5 from 25: 25 - 5 = 20.

Now, we divide the remaining lollipops (20) by the number of friends (4): 20 ÷ 4 = 5.

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

"To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we need to first find out how many oranges they have in total. Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. 

34 (Sitti's oranges) + 22 (Juris's oranges) = 56 oranges

Now, we need to find out how many people will be sharing the oranges. Sitti and Juris will be sharing the oranges with their 6 friends, so there are 2 (Sitti and Juris) + 6 (friends) = 8 people in total.

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the number of people.

56 (total oranges) ÷ 8 (number of people) = 7 oranges per person

So, everyone will get 7 oranges.

"To find the cost per serving, we need to find the total cost of the ingredients and divide it by the number of servings.

Antoine wants to use double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 x 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of onions is 4 pounds x $2.00 per pound = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which costs 2 x $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know that it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater. Since Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, Bernadette's drive will take 4 x 4 = 16 minutes.

We also know that Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to arrive 4 - 5 = -1 minute before Wayne. But since you can't arrive before you start, we need to figure out how much earlier Bernadette should leave.

If Bernadette arrives 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, then she needs to leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to leave 21 minutes before Wayne.

So Bernadette should leave 21 minutes before Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to know the length and width of the room. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. 

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet because the area is in square feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so 3 yards is equal to 3 x 3 = 9 feet.

Now we have the area and the length. We can use the formula for area to find the width: Area = Length x Width. 

360 = 9 x Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is Perimeter = 2 x (Length + Width).

Perimeter = 2 x (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 x 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The final answer is: 98"

First, Marcus bakes for 3 hours. The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, in 3 hours, it will raise the temperature by 5 * 3 = 15 degrees. 

The initial temperature is 40 degrees. After baking, the temperature will be 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.

Then, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since 30 minutes is 3 times 10 minutes, the house will cool down 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

The final temperature will be 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.

"Let's break down the information given. 

Jon's total time is 40 minutes for the swim, 80 minutes for the bike ride, and 50 minutes for the run. So, Jon's total time is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes.

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. 10% of 40 minutes is 4 minutes, so James finishes the swim in 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. Jon took 80 minutes, so James took 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, we know that Jon won by 10 minutes. This means that James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time. So, James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

We already know that James took 36 minutes for the swim and 85 minutes for the bike ride. To find out how long it took James to do the run, we need to subtract the time he took for the swim and bike ride from his total time. 

James' run time = James' total time - (swim time + bike time)
= 180 - (36 + 85)
= 180 - 121

1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, which is 75 minutes. So, we add 5 to 75.

75 + 5 = 80 minutes

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. We need to divide the length of Movie B by 4 to find the length of Movie A.

"To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we need to know how much hay he needs to buy and how much it costs.

First, let's find out how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is half an hour. 

If the horse runs at 32MPH, in half an hour it will run 32 * 0.5 = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, it will eat 16 * 0.5 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so 8 bails will cost 8 * 3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of 6 * 5 = $30.

To find out how much change he has after buying the hay, we need to subtract the cost of the hay from the total amount of money he has. 

$30 - $24 = $6.

Each glass needs 5 eggs, so we need to divide the total number of eggs by 5 to find out how many glasses Rozanne can make. 

50 eggs / 5 eggs per glass = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we need to divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays Rozanne can put out.

10 glasses / 5 glasses per tray = 2 trays.

"To find the profit, we need to first find the cost of the sneakers and the total amount of money the salesman made from selling them.

The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576. To find the cost per sneaker, we divide the total cost by the number of sneakers:

Cost per sneaker = Total cost / Number of sneakers
Cost per sneaker = $576 / 48
Cost per sneaker = $12

The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each on Monday. To find the total amount of money he made from selling these sneakers, we multiply the number of sneakers sold by the price per sneaker:

Money made from Monday sales = Number of sneakers sold * Price per sneaker
Money made from Monday sales = 17 * $20
Money made from Monday sales = $340

The salesman sold the rest of the sneakers (48 - 17 = 31) to a department store for $25 each. To find the total amount of money he made from selling these sneakers, we multiply the number of sneakers sold by the price per sneaker:

Money made from department store sales = Number of sneakers sold * Price per sneaker
Money made from department store sales = 31 * $25
Money made from department store sales = $775

The total amount of money the salesman made from selling the sneakers is the sum of the money made from Monday sales and the department store sales:

Total money made = Money made from Monday sales + Money made from department store sales
Total money made = $340 + $775
Total money made = $1115

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost of the sneakers from the total amount of money made:

Profit = Total money made - Total cost
Profit = $1115 - $576
Profit = $539

If you bought the super ticket, it would cost $20. If you didn't buy the super ticket, you saved $2, so the total cost would be $20 - $2 = $18. 

You also know that the super ticket includes a $1 extra for popcorn and soda. So, the total cost without the super ticket would be $18 - $1 = $17. 

The cost of the movie ticket is $12. So, the cost of popcorn and soda would be $17 - $12 = $5. 

Since the soda costs $3, the cost of popcorn would be $5 - $3 = $2. 

The regular price of popcorn is $2. 

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know that the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. To find the cost of filling one balloon, we need to divide the total cost by the number of balloons. 

Cost per balloon = Total cost / Number of balloons
Cost per balloon = $900 / 20
Cost per balloon = $45

Now, we know that the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. So, the new cost per balloon is $45 + $20 = $65.

Bentley wants to fill 170 balloons. To find the total cost, we multiply the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons.

Total cost = New cost per balloon * Number of balloons
Total cost = $65 * 170
Total cost = $11,050

"To find the average speed, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken. 

First, let's find the distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours. Distance = speed * time = 60 * 2 = 120 miles.

Next, let's find the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour. Distance = speed * time = 30 * 1 = 30 miles.

Now, let's add the distances together to find the total distance traveled. Total distance = 120 + 30 = 150 miles.

The total time taken is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

To find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time. Average speed = total distance / total time = 150 / 3 = 50 mph.

"To find out how much potting soil Bob needs, we need to find the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds. 

The volume of one raised bed is its length times its width times its height. 

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 8 * 2 * 2
Volume = 32 cubic feet

Since there are 10 raised beds, we multiply the volume of one bed by 10.

Total volume = 32 * 10
Total volume = 320 cubic feet

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so we need to divide the total volume by 2 to find out how many bags Bob needs.

Number of bags = Total volume / 2
Number of bags = 320 / 2
Number of bags = 160

Each bag costs $12, so we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag to find the total cost.

Then, her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw, so her friend saw 50 / 2 = 25 fairies. 
Now, there are 50 + 25 = 75 fairies. 
Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. 
So, there are 75 - 30 = 45 fairies remaining.

"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to first find the total number of puppies and the number of puppies with spots. 

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and 3 of them have spots. Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, and 4 of them have spots. 

The total number of puppies is 8 + 12 = 20. 

The total number of puppies with spots is 3 + 4 = 7.

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we divide the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100.

(7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

The final answer is: 35"
"To find out how many trips the farmer needs to make, we need to calculate the total weight of all the feed and divide it by the weight the truck can carry.

First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound per box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds per bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds per bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds per sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up the total weight of all the feed:
2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds

Since the truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:
3400 / 2250 = 1.511 (round up to 2 because you can't make a fraction of a trip)

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling, we need to calculate how much she earns from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately, then add them together.

Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week. Each can is worth 2 cents. So, she earns 3 x 2 = 6 cents from aluminum cans per week.

Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week. Each bottle is worth 3 cents. So, she earns 5 x 3 = 15 cents from plastic bottles per week.

In a week, Grayson earns 6 cents from aluminum cans and 15 cents from plastic bottles. So, in a week, she earns 6 + 15 = 21 cents.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly earnings by 4. 21 x 4 = 84 cents.

The final answer is: 84"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know Frederick has 10 plants. 

Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. To find 60% of 10, we multiply 10 by 0.6. 

10 * 0.6 = 6

So, Toni has 10 + 6 = 16 plants.

Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. To find out how many plants Shondra has, we subtract 7 from Toni's plants.

16 - 7 = 9

So, Shondra has 9 plants.

"To find out how much Ali has now, we need to know how much Leila gave him. Leila gave him half of her $100, so we need to divide 100 by 2 to find out how much she gave him.

100 / 2 = 50

Now, we need to add the amount Leila gave him to Ali's original amount of $21.

$21 + $50 = $71

So, Ali now has $71.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many basketball cards Miss Maria has. She has 6 decks with 25 cards in each deck. So, the total number of basketball cards is 6 x 25 = 150.

Next, we need to find out how many baseball cards Miss Maria has. She has 5 boxes with 40 cards in each box. So, the total number of baseball cards is 5 x 40 = 200.

Now, we need to find the total number of cards Miss Maria has. We add the basketball cards and baseball cards together: 150 + 200 = 350.

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is 350 - 50 = 300.

Each student gets 10 cards, so we need to divide the total number of cards given to the students by 10 to find out how many students there are: 300 ÷ 10 = 30.

"First, let's find out how much Becky paid for the apples. She bought 20 apples for 45 cents each, but she got a $1 discount. 

First, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple: 20 x 0.45 = 9 dollars. 

Then, we subtract the discount from the total: 9 - 1 = 8 dollars.

Now, let's find out how much Kelly paid for the apples. She bought 20 apples for 50 cents each and got a 10% discount. 

First, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple: 20 x 0.5 = 10 dollars.

Then, we find 10% of 10 dollars: 10 x 0.1 = 1 dollar.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total: 10 - 1 = 9 dollars.

To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we subtract Becky's total from Kelly's total: 9 - 8 = 1 dollar.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Each room has 2 sheets. 
Each room has 1 comforter. 
Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases. 
Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so that's 2 * 4 = 8 towels. 

So, each room has 2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15 pieces of laundry. 

Now, we have 80 rooms. To find the total number of pieces of laundry, we multiply the number of pieces per room by the number of rooms: 15 * 80 = 1200.

The final answer is: 1200"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes. 

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since each pair has 2 shoes, he gets 5 x 2 = 10 shoes. Now he has 200 + 10 = 210 shoes.

On Wednesday, he gets 15 new pairs of shoes. That's 15 x 2 = 30 shoes. Now he has 210 + 30 = 240 shoes.

On Friday, he gets 30 new pairs of shoes. That's 30 x 2 = 60 shoes. Now he has 240 + 60 = 300 shoes.

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. So, he has 300 - 180 = 120 shoes left.

So, on Sunday, Fireman Frank will have 120 shoes.

"To find out how many pans of cupcakes Mary should bake, we need to know how many cupcakes she can make with the sprinkles she has. 

First, we need to find out how many cupcakes Mary can make with all her sprinkles. Since each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and she has 6 jars, we multiply 6 jars by 8 cupcakes per jar. 

6 jars * 8 cupcakes/jar = 48 cupcakes

Now, we know Mary can make 48 cupcakes with all her sprinkles. But we need to find out how many pans she should bake. Each pan holds 12 cupcakes. To do this, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes per pan.

48 cupcakes / 12 cupcakes/pan = 4 pans

So, Mary should bake 4 pans of cupcakes. 

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the price of the paper, we need to know that it costs $1 less than three times the price of the pen. The pen costs $2, so three times that is 3 x 2 = 6. Then, we subtract $1 from that, so 6 - 1 = 5. The paper costs $5.

Now, we know the total cost of the pen and the paper, which is $2 + $5 = $7.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we find out how many pencils were used in the first two months. There are 30 students and each student started with 10 pencils. So, the total number of pencils is 30 x 10 = 300. 1/5 of 300 is 300 / 5 = 60. So, 60 pencils were used in the first two months.

Now, we need to find out how many pencils were left after two months. We subtract the pencils used from the total pencils: 300 - 60 = 240.

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. To find out how many pencils were left, we need to multiply the remaining pencils by 1/3: 240 x 1/3 = 240 / 3 = 80.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know that Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total. He gets 2 extra cookies for cleaning his room, so he needs to get 5 - 2 = 3 cookies from eating carrot sticks.

Since he gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, we can say that the number of carrot sticks he eats is twice the number of cookies he gets from eating carrot sticks. So, if he gets 3 cookies from eating carrot sticks, he must eat 3 x 2 = 6 carrot sticks.

"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to multiply the number of remoras by their length. There are 2 remoras, each 6 inches long. 

2 remoras * 6 inches/remora = 12 inches

Now, we need to convert the shark's length to inches because the remoras' length is in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the shark is 10 feet * 12 inches/foot = 120 inches long.

Now, we need to find what percentage of the shark's length the remoras are. To do this, we'll divide the remoras' length by the shark's length and multiply by 100.

(12 inches / 120 inches) * 100 = 10%

"Let's say the total number of students is x. Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We know that 20 students do not have a desktop computer, so one-fourth of the total number of students is 20.

To find the total number of students, we can set up the equation: (1/4)x = 20

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4: x = 20 * 4

x = 80

So, there are 80 students at that grade level."

Kids allergic to dairy: 9
Kids allergic to peanuts: 6
Kids allergic to both: 3

First, add the kids allergic to dairy and peanuts: 9 + 6 = 15
Then subtract the kids allergic to both: 15 - 3 = 12

Now we know 12 kids are allergic to something. To find out how many kids aren't allergic to anything, we subtract 12 from the total number of kids in the class.

Heather also has a $2.00 coupon, so we need to subtract that from the cost of 1 pack. $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00. 

Since Heather is buying 2 packs, we need to multiply the cost by 2. But since she only paid for 1 pack, we just need to multiply the cost of 1 pack after the coupon by 2. $2.00 * 2 = $4.00.

Now, we need to find out how many razors she gets in total. 2 packs of razors have 4 razors each, so 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to divide the total cost by the number of razors. $4.00 / 8 = $0.50.

"Let's break down the costs for each venue. 

For the first venue, the cost is a flat fee of $200, plus $5 for each guest. If there are x guests, the total cost for the first venue is $200 + $5x.

For the second venue, the cost is $25 per guest. If there are x guests, the total cost for the second venue is $25x.

Since we want the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up an equation:

$200 + $5x = $25x

To solve for x, we need to get all the x terms on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting $5x from both sides:

$200 = $20x

Now, we can divide both sides by $20 to solve for x:

x = $200 / $20
x = 10

"Let's break this down step by step. 

Let's say David found x insects. Since Lily found 7 more than David, Lily found x + 7 insects. 

We also know that David found half of what Bodhi found. So, Bodhi found 2x insects (since David found half of Bodhi's insects).

We know that together they collected 43 insects. So, the total number of insects they found is the sum of what Lily, David, and Bodhi found. 

x + (x + 7) + 2x = 43

Combine like terms: 
4x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides: 
4x = 36

Divide both sides by 4: 
x = 9

Since x is the number of insects David found, and Lily found 7 more than David, Lily found x + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 insects.

Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn. We multiply 364 by 1/2.

364 * 1/2 = 364 / 2 = 182 yards

Now, we add the yards Mariah used and the yards her grandma used.

91 + 182 = 273 yards

So, they used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

The chair is 3 feet wide, and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. So, the rug is 3 + 5 = 8 feet wide.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 x 8 = 16 feet. 

So, the couch is 16 + 2 = 18 feet long.

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total. She bought 2 packs of strawberry gum. So, she bought 2 packs of strawberry gum and 2 other packs. 

She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum. She paid half as much for a pack of green apple gum, so she paid $2 / 2 = $1 for the green apple gum. 

The total cost of the grape and green apple gum is $2 + $1 = $3. 

She paid $7 in total for all the gum. So, the cost of the 2 packs of strawberry gum is $7 - $3 = $4. 

Since she bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, the cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $4 / 2 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to figure out how many sticks he can get from the cheapest lumber he can buy with $24.

A 2 x 4 costs $4 and gives 200 sticks. 
A 2 x 8 costs $6 and gives 400 sticks.

Since a 2 x 4 is cheaper, let's see how many 2 x 4s Frederick can buy with $24. 
$24 / $4 = 6

So, Frederick can buy 6 2 x 4s. 
6 * 200 = 1200 sticks

The final answer is: 1200"
"To find out how much it will cost Mario to buy snowshoes for all his dogs, we need to know how many snowshoes he needs in total. Since each dog has 4 legs, and he has 6 dogs, we multiply the number of dogs by the number of legs each dog has.

6 dogs * 4 legs = 24 legs

Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the total number of snowshoes.

24 legs / 2 = 12 snowshoes

Now, we know that each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00. Since we have 12 snowshoes, we need to multiply the number of snowshoes by the cost per pair.

12 snowshoes * $12.00 = $144.00

So, it will cost Mario $144.00 to buy snowshoes for all his dogs.

$144.00"
"To find out how much Janet would save, we need to first find out how much she pays for bus trips in a week. 

Janet takes 2 bus trips a day and she does this 5 days a week. So, she takes 2 x 5 = 10 bus trips a week. 

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so 10 bus trips a week would cost 10 x $2.20 = $22. 

If she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save $22 - $20 = $2. 

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

The farm has 30 cows. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 2 x 30 = 60 cows.

The zoo has 20 sheep. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's count the total number of animals on the farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.

The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, so the total number of animals on the zoo is 60 + 20 = 80 animals.

To find the total number of animals on both the farm and the zoo, we add the number of animals on the farm and the zoo: 40 + 80 = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

We know Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. 

Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, let's say Sophia bought x onions and x potatoes. 

So, 4 times the number of onions Sophia bought is 4x, and 4 times the number of potatoes Sophia bought is also 4x. 

We know Rose bought 12 onions, which is 4 times the number of onions Sophia bought, so 4x = 12. 

To find x, we need to divide both sides by 4. 

x = 12 / 4 
x = 3 

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 3 potatoes. 

The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 3 + 3 = 6. 

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many days Andy has to lose the weight, we need to count the days from December 31st to July 19th. 

December has 31 days, January has 31 days, February has 28 days (since it's not a leap year), March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and July has 19 days. 

31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 201 days

Now, we need to find out how many calories Andy needs to burn in total to lose 30 pounds. Since he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, he needs to burn 30 * 3500 calories to lose 30 pounds.

30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories

Now, we need to find out how many calories he needs to burn each day to reach his goal. We divide the total calories by the number of days.

105,000 / 201 = 521 calories

So, Andy needs to have a calorie deficit of 521 calories each day to reach his goal."
"Let's figure this out. Gerald works at a daycare and gets paid $30 every day. He worked for a whole week, which is 7 days. 

To find out how much he made in a week, we multiply the amount he gets paid per day by the number of days he worked. 

$30 per day * 7 days = $210

Now, we know Gerald spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from the amount he made.

$210 (made) - $100 (spent) = $110

So, Gerald has $110 left. 

$110"
"To find out how much water Hannah needs, we need to know how many kilometers she will run. Since she has to run 8 laps and each lap is 0.25 km, we multiply the number of laps by the distance of each lap.

8 laps * 0.25 km/lap = 2 km

Now, we know Hannah will run 2 km. Since she needs 60 ml of water for each kilometer, we multiply the total kilometers by the amount of water she needs per kilometer.

2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml

So, Hannah will need 120 ml of water.

"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to follow the steps:

1. Julie started with $500.
2. She spent 20% of $500 on clothes. 20% of 500 is 0.2 x 500 = 100. So, she spent $100 on clothes.
3. Now, she has $500 - $100 = $400 left.
4. Then, she spent 25% of the remaining money on CDs. 25% of 400 is 0.25 x 400 = 100. So, she spent $100 on CDs.
5. Now, she has $400 - $100 = $300 left.

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's say the lot cost x dollars. Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the house cost 3x dollars. The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. So, we can write an equation: x + 3x = 120,000. 

Combine like terms: 4x = 120,000. 

Divide both sides by 4: x = 30,000. 

Since the house cost 3x dollars, the house cost 3 * 30,000 = 90,000 dollars.

The final answer is: $90,000."
"To find the profit, we need to find out how much Tara spent on the canvas bags and how much she earned from selling them.

First, let's find out how much Tara spent on the canvas bags. She bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each. So, she bought 8 * 5 = 40 canvas bags. The cost of 8 packs is 8 * $4 = $32. But this is the cost of 8 packs, not 40 bags. Since each pack has 5 bags, the cost of 40 bags is 8 * $4 = $32. 

Now, let's find out how much Tara earned from selling the canvas bags. She sold each bag for $8. So, she earned 40 * $8 = $320.

Now, let's find out the profit. Profit is the amount earned minus the amount spent. So, the profit is $320 - $32 = $288.

"Let's break it down step by step.

Ali has 4 $10 bills and 6 $20 bills. First, we need to find the total amount of money he has. 

4 $10 bills = 4 x $10 = $40
6 $20 bills = 6 x $20 = $120
Total money = $40 + $120 = $160

Ali gives his sister half of the total money. Half of $160 is $80. So, he gives his sister $80.

Remaining money = $160 - $80 = $80

Now, he uses 3/5 of the remaining money to buy dinner. 3/5 of $80 is (3/5) x $80 = $48.

Money left after buying dinner = $80 - $48 = $32

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that Rob takes 2 hours to shingle a house. We need to convert 2 hours into minutes because the time taken by Royce is given in minutes. 

1 hour = 60 minutes
2 hours = 2 x 60 = 120 minutes

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time taken by Rob. 

Time taken by Rob = 120 minutes
Double the time taken by Rob = 2 x 120 = 240 minutes
Time taken by Royce = 240 + 40 = 280 minutes

36 red tulips / 6 tulips per row = 6 rows of red tulips

To find out how many rows of blue tulips Jackson can plant, we need to divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row.

24 blue tulips / 8 tulips per row = 3 rows of blue tulips

Since we can't have a fraction of a row, we can plant 6 rows of red tulips and 3 rows of blue tulips.

The total number of rows of flowers Jackson can plant is 6 + 3 = 9 rows.

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to know how many cups of raisins she has left after dividing the bag among the three things. 

First, let's find out how many cups of raisins she will use for the granola and snack mix. Since she divides the bag equally among the three things, she will use 1/3 of the raisins for each thing. 

1/3 of 27 cups is 9 cups. So, she will use 9 cups for the granola and snack mix together. 

Now, we need to find out how many cups of raisins she will use for the oatmeal cookies. Since a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins, we need to divide the total number of cups of raisins by 3/4 to find out how many batches she can make.

To divide 27 cups by 3/4, we can multiply 27 by 4/3. 

27 * 4/3 = 36/3 = 12

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to first find out how much she pays per week before and after adding the new device.

Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. Since there are 7 days in a week, her weekly consumption is 12 * 7 = 84 kilowatts per hour.

The cost of 1 kilowatt per hour is $1.50. So, Ada's weekly bill before adding the new device is 84 * $1.50 = $126.

The new device will consume 2 kilowatts per hour a day. So, her new weekly consumption will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour per day. Her new weekly consumption is 14 * 7 = 98 kilowatts per hour.

Her new weekly bill will be 98 * $1.50 = $147.

The difference in her weekly electric bill is $147 - $126 = $21.

"Let's break down the information given. 

Ophelia has 20 sofas. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than Ophelia, Jenna has 20 - 2 = 18 sofas.

It's also given that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. If Ophelia has x chairs, then Jenna has 3x chairs. Since they live in the same apartment building, the number of chairs they have is the same. So, we can set up the equation: x + 3x = 20 + 18 (since Ophelia has 20 sofas and Jenna has 18 sofas, and we want to find the number of chairs they have in total).

Combine like terms: 4x = 38

Divide both sides by 4: x = 9.5

Since we can't have half a chair, this means the problem is not solvable with the given information. However, we can still find the total number of chairs and sofas they have. 

Ophelia has 20 sofas and x chairs, so she has 20 + 9.5 = 29.5 pieces of furniture. Jenna has 18 sofas and 3x chairs, so she has 18 + 3(9.5) = 18 + 28.5 = 46.5 pieces of furniture.

The total number of sofas and chairs they have is 29.5 + 46.5 = 76.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Josh spent 4 hours working out every week except for some occasions. He spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks, and 6 hours in one week. 

First, let's find the total hours he spent working out in the weeks where he spent 4 hours. There are 8 weeks in total, but he didn't spend 4 hours in all of them. He spent 5 hours for 2 weeks and 6 hours for 1 week. So, he didn't spend 4 hours in 8 - 3 = 5 weeks. 

The total hours he spent working out in the 5 weeks where he spent 4 hours is 5 * 4 = 20 hours.

Now, let's find the total hours he spent working out in the weeks where he spent 5 hours. He spent 5 hours for 2 weeks, so the total hours he spent working out in those weeks is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

He also spent 6 hours in one week, so the total hours he spent working out in that week is 6 hours.

Now, let's add up all the hours he spent working out: 20 + 10 + 6 = 36 hours.

The total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is 36."
"Let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 people get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is 48 - 8 = 40.

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (which is 8) get into the bus. So, 5 x 8 = 40 people get in. Now, the total number of people on the bus is 40 (left) + 40 (got in) = 80.

At the second stop, 21 people get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is 80 - 21 = 59.

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. This means 3 times 21 is 63, but 3 times fewer means 21 - 63 = -42. Since you can't have a negative number of people getting on the bus, it means that 63 people got on. Now, the total number of people on the bus is 59 (left) + 63 (got in) = 122.

Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his age in 5 years will be 27. To find his current age, we need to subtract 5 from 27. 

Current age of Jame = 27 - 5 = 22

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. Let's first find Jame's age in 8 years. 

Jame's age in 8 years = 22 + 8 = 30

Now, we need to find Jame's cousin's age in 8 years. It will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age in 8 years. 

Twice Jame's age in 8 years = 2 * 30 = 60
Jame's cousin's age in 8 years = 60 - 5 = 55

Now, we need to find Jame's cousin's current age. We know Jame's cousin's age in 8 years is 55, so we subtract 8 from 55 to find the current age.

Current age of Jame's cousin = 55 - 8 = 47

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. 

We also know the computer cost $1,100. 

Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800.

To find the cost of the 2 monitors, we subtract the cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

Since there are 2 monitors, we divide the cost of the 2 monitors by 2 to find the cost of one monitor: $600 / 2 = $300.

First, we know that there are 20 kids in total, and they were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys. So, there are 10 girls and 10 boys.

The boys brought back 60 shells each, so the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 x 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + 4 x 60 shells.

First, we need to find 4 times as many seashells as the boys brought. 4 x 60 = 240.

Now, we add the number of shells the boys brought to 4 times the number of shells the boys brought. 600 + 240 = 840.

So, the girls brought 840 shells in total. Since there are 10 girls, we need to divide the total number of shells by 10 to find out how many shells each girl brought. 

840 / 10 = 84.

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Now, we know Alyana is 6 years old. Since Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, we add 2 to Alyana's age to find Anne's age.

So, the eldest boy got $6 initially.

The eldest boy added $5 to his share, so now he has $6 + $5 = $11.

The following day, he added another $10, so now he has $11 + $10 = $21.

First, we need to find out how much Elvis saves in the first half of the month. Since there are 30 days in April, the first half of the month will have 15 days. 

Let's say Elvis saves x dollars per day in the first half. Then, the total amount he saves in the first half is 15x dollars.

In the second half, he wants to save twice as much daily as he saves in the first half, so he will save 2x dollars per day. The second half also has 15 days, so the total amount he saves in the second half is 15 * 2x = 30x dollars.

The total amount Elvis wants to save in the month is $1125. So, we can set up the equation: 15x + 30x = 1125.

Combine like terms: 45x = 1125.

Now, divide both sides by 45: x = 1125 / 45 = 25.

So, Elvis saves $25 per day in the first half of the month.

Now, we need to find out how much he saves per day in the second half. We already know that he saves twice as much in the second half as in the first half, so he saves 2 * 25 = $50 per day in the second half.

Verna gave $20, so the change she received is $20 - $13 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, we need to find out how much they both get and then subtract Jenny's amount from Jairus's amount.

Jairus gets $0.8 for each task, and he finished 20 tasks. So, Jairus gets 0.8 x 20 = $16.

Jenny gets $0.5 for each task, and she finished 20 tasks. So, Jenny gets 0.5 x 20 = $10.

Now, we need to find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny. To do that, we subtract Jenny's amount from Jairus's amount: 16 - 10 = 6.

The final answer is: $6"
"Let's say Brad gets x dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars. 

We know that the total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation: x + 4x = 100.

Combine like terms: 5x = 100.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 20.

Since Jeff gets 4x dollars, we multiply x by 4: 4x = 4 * 20 = 80.

So, Jeff gets 80 dollars. 

80"
"To find out how many miles Jeff walks, we need to calculate the total distance he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works.

The distance to his work is 3 miles, and he walks there and back, so the total distance he walks each day is 3 + 3 = 6 miles.

Since he works 5 times a week, we multiply the distance he walks each day by the number of days he works: 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how many letters Elise has written, we need to break it down step by step.

First, Elise writes the alphabet in full twice. The alphabet has 26 letters, so she writes 26 x 2 = 52 letters.

Then, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of 26 is 13, so she writes 13 letters.

Next, she re-writes everything she has already written. This means she re-writes 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

So, the total number of letters Elise has written is 52 + 13 + 65 = 130.

The final answer is: 130"
"This is a geometric progression problem. 

Let's break it down:

- In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.
- In the second round, each of the 3 families calls 3 other families, so there are 3 x 3 = 9 new families called.
- In the third round, each of the 9 families calls 3 other families, so there are 9 x 3 = 27 new families called.
- In the fourth round, each of the 27 families calls 3 other families, so there are 27 x 3 = 81 new families called.

The total number of families called in the fourth round is 81."
"Let's figure this out. Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months. So, he lost a total of 10 x 3 = 30 pounds. 

If his final weight was 70 pounds and he lost 30 pounds, then his initial weight was 70 + 30 = 100 pounds.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many toys Jonathan has, we need to figure out how many toys he needs to make a play set five times larger than James's. 

James has 80 toys, and a play set five times larger than James's would have 5 x 80 = 400 toys. 

Since Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make this play set, let's call the number of toys Jonathan has ""x"". Then, x + 2 = 400. 

To find x, we need to subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: x = 400 - 2. 

x = 398.

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys. 

The final answer is: 398"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the discount.

First, let's find the cost of each item:

- 5 notebooks at $1.50 each: 5 x $1.50 = $7.50
- 2 pens at $0.25 each: 2 x $0.25 = $0.50
- 1 calculator at $12 each: 1 x $12 = $12
- 1 geometry set at $10 each: 1 x $10 = $10

Now, let's add the cost of all the items: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30

The shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items. To find the discount, we need to calculate 10% of $30:
10% of $30 = 0.1 x $30 = $3

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost:
$30 - $3 = $27

So, Daniel has to spend $27 on all the items he wants to buy.

The final answer is: $27"
"To find out how much change Carly gets back, we need to calculate the total cost of the food and drinks she ordered. 

First, let's find the cost of the hamburgers: 5 hamburgers * $4 each = $20

Next, let's find the cost of the potato fries: 10 packs * $0.30 each = $3

Then, let's find the cost of the fruit drinks: 5 cans * $2 each = $10

Now, let's add up the total cost: $20 + $3 + $10 = $33

Carly gave a $50 bill, so to find the change, we subtract the total cost from the $50 bill: $50 - $33 = $17

The final answer is: $17"
"To find out how much Antonella earned, we need to calculate her commission for the first $1000 and the commission for the sales over $1000.

For the first $1000, she earns 30% commission. 
30% of $1000 is 0.3 x 1000 = $300.

For the sales over $1000, she earns an additional 10% commission. 
The sales over $1000 are $2500 - $1000 = $1500.
10% of $1500 is 0.1 x 1500 = $150.

Now, we add the commission for the first $1000 and the commission for the sales over $1000.
$300 + $150 = $450.

So, Antonella earned $450. 

The final answer is: $450"
"First, we need to find out how many bottles Bill already has. He has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each, so he has 2 x 24 = 48 bottles.

Next, we need to figure out how many bottles he needs in total. He wants 2 bottles for each of his 70 guests, so he needs 70 x 2 = 140 bottles.

Now, we need to find out how many more bottles he needs to buy. To do this, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs: 140 - 48 = 92.

So, Bill needs to buy 92 more bottles of water. 

92"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. 

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long. Twice as long as 16 minutes is 32 minutes. 2 minutes more than that is 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

So, on a cold day, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes, and on a warm day, he swims a mile in 34 minutes.

To find out how much longer it takes on a warm day, we need to find the difference between the two times. 34 - 16 = 18 minutes.

Now, let's find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day and a warm day. On a cold day, it would be 3 x 16 = 48 minutes. On a warm day, it would be 3 x 34 = 102 minutes.

To find the difference, we subtract the time on a cold day from the time on a warm day. 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find out how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate how much money he makes in a week and then divide $80 by that amount.

John gets paid $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day. So, he makes $2 x 5 = $10 per day.

Since he works 4 days a week, he makes $10 x 4 = $40 per week.

Now, we need to divide $80 by $40 to find out how many weeks it will take John to save $80.

$80 ÷ $40 = 2

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80."

Cost of foot-long fish sub: $40
Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub: $40 * 3 = $120

Now, we need to add the cost of both subs to find the total cost of lunch.

Total cost = Cost of foot-long fish sub + Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub
Total cost = $40 + $120
Total cost = $160

"Let's break it down. We have 21 buttons in total. 7 of them have 2 holes each, and the rest have 4 holes each. 

First, let's find out how many buttons have 4 holes. We can do this by subtracting the number of buttons with 2 holes from the total number of buttons. 

21 (total buttons) - 7 (buttons with 2 holes) = 14 buttons with 4 holes.

Now, let's find out the total number of holes in the buttons with 2 holes. We can do this by multiplying the number of buttons with 2 holes by 2.

7 (buttons with 2 holes) * 2 = 14 holes

Now, let's find out the total number of holes in the buttons with 4 holes. We can do this by multiplying the number of buttons with 4 holes by 4.

14 (buttons with 4 holes) * 4 = 56 holes

Now, let's add the total number of holes in the buttons with 2 holes and the buttons with 4 holes to get the total number of holes.

14 (holes in buttons with 2 holes) + 56 (holes in buttons with 4 holes) = 70 holes

"To find out how big Peter's locker is, we need to find out how big Zack's locker is first. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we need to divide Timothy's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches. 
Zack's locker is 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches.

Now, we need to find out how big Peter's locker is. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To find out how big Peter's locker is, we need to divide Zack's locker size by 4.

Peter's locker is 12 / 4 = 3 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee. If we don't know the daily recommended cups, we can call it 'x'. So, Octavia drinks x/2 cups of coffee.

We also know that Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks. So, Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) cups of coffee, which is 5x cups of coffee.

Now, Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. To find out how many cups he needs to reduce, we need to subtract the recommended amount from the amount he currently drinks. 

So, the amount Juan needs to reduce is 5x - 4 cups.

But we still don't know the value of x. Let's assume the daily recommended cups of coffee is 8 (this is a common recommendation). 

If the daily recommended cups of coffee is 8, then Octavia drinks 8/2 = 4 cups of coffee. 

Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, Juan drinks 10 * 4 = 40 cups of coffee.

Now, we can find out how many cups Juan needs to reduce. 40 - 4 = 36 cups.

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total number of rodents, we need to add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs. 

First, let's find the total number of hamsters. There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, so we multiply 3 by 10 to get 30 hamsters.

Next, we find the total number of guinea pigs. There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so we multiply 3 by 5 to get 15 guinea pigs.

Now, we add the total number of hamsters and guinea pigs to get the total number of rodents. 30 (hamsters) + 15 (guinea pigs) = 45 rodents.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the average weight, we need to know the total weight of all three friends and then divide it by 3.

Mark weighs 150 pounds. 
Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 x 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we add up the weights of all three friends: 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by 3: 540 / 3 = 180.

The final answer is: 180"
"To find the final angle of the sun from the ground, we need to add the initial angle of the pyramid and the angle the sun moves. 

The initial angle of the pyramid is 32 degrees. The sun moves 5 degrees an hour for 10 hours, so it moves 5 * 10 = 50 degrees.

Now, we add the initial angle and the angle the sun moved: 32 + 50 = 82 degrees.

The final angle of the sun from the ground is 82 degrees.

82"
"To find out how many packs of candles James needs, we need to know how many candles he needs in total. Since one son is 12 and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

For a 12-year-old, James will need 12 candles, and for an 8-year-old, he will need 8 candles. So, in total, he needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs. We can do this by dividing the total number of candles by the number of candles in a pack: 20 / 5 = 4.

Since James needs 4 packs of candles, and each pack costs $3, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of packs by the cost per pack: 4 * 3 = 12.

"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to multiply the number of minutes she read each night by the number of nights in a week. There are 7 nights in a week. 

15 minutes * 7 nights = 105 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes. We know she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. 

First, let's find out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 105 minutes. 

105 minutes / 1.5 minutes = 70 intervals

Now, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of pages she can read in each interval. 

70 intervals * 2 pages = 140 pages

So, Judy read 140 pages in the first week. 

In the second week, she read 100 pages. 

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages she read in the first week and the second week.

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, so we need to find a third of 12. To do that, we divide 12 by 3. 12 divided by 3 is 4. So Cody ate 4 sandwiches.

Now, Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches. To find a quarter of 12, we divide 12 by 4. 12 divided by 4 is 3. So Trevor ate 3 sandwiches.

Now, let's add the sandwiches that Cody and Trevor ate. 4 (Cody's sandwiches) + 3 (Trevor's sandwiches) = 7 sandwiches.

So, Cody and Trevor ate a total of 7 sandwiches.

To find out how many sandwiches are left, we need to subtract the sandwiches they ate from the total number of sandwiches. 12 (total sandwiches) - 7 (sandwiches eaten) = 5 sandwiches.

In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. Let's call the nephew's age in 7 years ""x"". So, we can write the equation: 51 = 3x.

To find the nephew's age in 7 years, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 3. x = 51 / 3 = 17.

Since we want to know the nephew's age today, we need to subtract 7 from 17. The nephew's age today is 17 - 7 = 10.

So, Anna scored 35 goals. 

Now, we know that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. To find out how many goals Mark scored, we need to subtract 20 from 80.

80 - 20 = 60

So, Mark scored 60 goals.

Now, we know how many goals each of them scored. To find the total number of goals, we need to add the goals scored by all three of them.

Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35

"Let's break this down step by step. 

Peter has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week. There are 7 days in a week. 

To find out how much he can spend each day, we need to divide the total money he has by the number of days. 

$70 ÷ 7 days = $10 per day

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. 

He spent 4 days (Sunday to Wednesday) on wooden action figures. 

4 days * $10 per day = $40 spent on wooden action figures

Since each wooden action figure costs $5, we can find out how many he bought by dividing the total money spent on wooden action figures by the cost of one wooden action figure.

$40 ÷ $5 = 8 wooden action figures

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. 

He has $30 left ($70 - $40) to spend on plastic action figures. 

We can find out how many plastic action figures he can buy by dividing the remaining money by the cost of one plastic action figure.

$30 ÷ $2 = 15 plastic action figures

To find the total number of action figures, we add the number of wooden action figures and plastic action figures.

8 wooden action figures + 15 plastic action figures = 23 action figures

"To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we need to know how many roses he supplies in total and how many roses he grows in a month. 

First, let's find out how many roses Ford supplies in a week. The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. 

20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses per week.

Ford grows 40 roses every week. To find out how many roses he lacks, we need to subtract the number of roses he supplies from the number of roses he grows. 

40 (roses grown) - 65 (roses supplied) = -25 roses per week. 

Since Ford lacks 25 roses per week, we need to find out how many weeks are in a month. There are 4 weeks in a month. 

-25 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = -100 roses per month.

Since we can't lack a negative number of roses, it means Ford has extra roses to supply the shops. So, Ford has 100 roses extra per month."
"To find out how much money will be remaining in Katina's account after 2 years, we need to first find out how many months are in 2 years. There are 12 months in a year, so 2 years will have 2 x 12 = 24 months.

Now, we know that Katina removes $100 from her account every month. So, in 24 months, she will remove 24 x $100 = $2400 from her account.

To find out how much money will be remaining in her account, we need to subtract the money she removed from the initial amount. So, $3000 - $2400 = $600.

"To find the net profit, we need to first find the cost and the revenue. 

The cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. So, the cost of bread for 1 sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30. 

The cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00. So, the cost of cheese and condiments for 1 sandwich is $30.00 / 10 = $3.00.

The total cost for 1 sandwich is $0.30 (bread) + $3.00 (cheese and condiments) = $3.30.

The revenue from selling 1 sandwich is $7.00.

The profit from 1 sandwich is $7.00 (revenue) - $3.30 (cost) = $3.70.

The profit from 10 sandwiches is $3.70 (profit per sandwich) * 10 = $37.00.

The net profit is the profit from 10 sandwiches, which is $37.00."
"To find out how much money Kate can make, we need to know how many muffin crayons she can make. 

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together in each muffin tin, and there are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we need to find out how many small pieces of crayons there are in total. 

There are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, so there are 3 x 64 = 192 crayons. 

Since each box has 64 crayons, and each crayon is divided into 8 small pieces, we need to multiply 64 by 8 to find out how many small pieces there are in one box. 64 x 8 = 512 small pieces in one box. 

Now, we multiply the number of small pieces in one box by the number of boxes. 512 x 3 = 1536 small pieces of crayons. 

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together in each muffin tin, we need to divide the total number of small pieces by 8 to find out how many muffin crayons she can make. 1536 ÷ 8 = 192 muffin crayons.

Now that we know Kate can make 192 muffin crayons, we can multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price of each muffin crayon to find out how much money Kate can make. 192 x $1.50 = $288.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the area of the bedroom and then multiply it by the costs of the carpet, padding, and installation.

The area of the bedroom is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the new carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 * $12 = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 * $2 = $432.

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removing the old carpet is 216 * $4 = $864.

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installing the new carpet is 216 * $34 = $7344.

The total cost is the sum of the costs of the carpet, padding, removal, and installation: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11332.

"To find the correct temperature, we need to figure out how much the oven is off by. We know that when Maggie sets it to 450, it's actually 468. 

First, let's find the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature: 468 - 450 = 18.

Now, we need to find out what percentage 18 is of 450. To do that, we'll divide 18 by 450 and multiply by 100: (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

So, the oven is off by 4%. Now, we need to find the temperature that is 4% less than 520. To do that, we'll multiply 520 by 0.96 (since 100% - 4% = 96% or 0.96). 

520 * 0.96 = 496.8.

So, Maggie should set her oven to 496.8 degrees."
"To find the total time Max will spend watching movies, we need to add the time of the first movie and the time of the second movie.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. We need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 1 hour is 60 minutes. Adding 30 minutes to that makes 90 minutes for the first movie.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. We need to convert the hours to minutes. 2 hours is 2 x 60 = 120 minutes. Adding 5 minutes to that makes 125 minutes for the second movie.

Now, we add the time of the first movie (90 minutes) and the time of the second movie (125 minutes). 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.

The total time Max will spend watching the two movies is 215 minutes.

"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's house price. 

30% of $76,000 is 0.30 x $76,000 = $22,800. 

Now, subtract $22,800 from $76,000 to find the value of Juan's house: $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.

The value of Juan's house is $53,200.

Now, to find the combined value of the two houses, we add the value of Juan's house to Herb's house price: $53,200 + $76,000 = $129,200.

The final answer is: $129,200."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 x 12 = 24 dishes. 

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 + 20 = 60 dishes. 

To find the total number of cups Judy brought, we add 12 + 40 = 52 cups. To find the total number of dishes Judy brought, we add 24 + 60 = 84 dishes.

The total number of utensils brought by the two is the sum of the total cups and total dishes, which is 52 + 84 = 136.

"To find out how many pairs of contacts Pete will need, we need to multiply the number of days he needs contacts by the number of contacts he uses per day. 

Pete needs contacts for 45 days and uses 90 contacts per box. So, he will need 45 days * 90 contacts / 45 days = 90 contacts per box. 

Since he buys 2 boxes, he will have 90 * 2 = 180 contacts. 

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of contacts he will have. Since each box has 90 contacts, and he buys 2 boxes, he will have 90 * 2 = 180 contacts. 

To find the number of pairs, we divide the total number of contacts by 2. 180 / 2 = 90 pairs.

Now, we need to find the cost of the contacts. Each box is $100 and there's a 10% discount. 

10% of $100 is 0.1 * 100 = $10. 

So, the discounted price of each box is $100 - $10 = $90.

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost will be 2 * $90 = $180.

To find the cost per pair, we divide the total cost by the number of pairs. $180 / 90 pairs = $2 per pair.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find out how much money John and Jill earned, we need to find out how many hours they worked and multiply it by the hourly wage.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so she worked a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 x 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 x 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

The hourly wage is $10. Jill earned 3 x $10 = $30. John earned 7 x $10 = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings. $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"First, we need to find out how many calories Hannah burns in total. She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour, so she burns 2 x 500 = 1000 calories. Then, she spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour, so she burns 1 x 600 = 600 calories. In total, she burns 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Now, we need to find out how many 200-calorie blocks there are in 1600 calories. We can do this by dividing 1600 by 200, which is 1600 ÷ 200 = 8.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, and there are 8 blocks of 200 calories, she needs to drink 8 x 100 = 800 ml of water.

The final answer is: 800"
"Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is B. 

Since there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of red jelly beans is B - 0.01B = 0.99B.

Since there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of green jelly beans is B + 0.01B = 1.01B.

The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation: 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500.

Combine like terms: 2.99B = 4500.

Divide both sides by 2.99: B = 1500.

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans: 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1495.

And the number of green jelly beans: 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515.

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract: 1515 - 1495 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the average, we need to add up all the measurements and then divide by the number of measurements. 

First, let's add up the measurements: 47 + 52 + (52 + 5) = 47 + 52 + 57 = 156

Now, we need to divide the sum by the number of measurements, which is 3. 

156 / 3 = 52

"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, Alex invites 100 people via email. Each of these people will invite 2 friends, so that's 100 x 2 = 200 more people. 

Now, Alex also calls 10 friends and 8 of them will bring their spouses. That's 10 friends and 8 spouses, which is 18 more people.

So, the total number of people coming is 100 (initially invited) + 200 (from the email invites) + 18 (from the phone calls) = 318 people.

Alex needs to have enough seats for 318 people.

"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to find the weight of the Papillon first. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 10 * 2 = 20 pounds. 

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 5 * 44 = 220 pounds.

"To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to calculate the total cost on both Amazon and eBay. 

On Amazon, the boots cost $16 and shipping costs $4, so the total cost is $16 + $4 = $20.

On eBay, the boots cost $13 and shipping costs twice as much as Amazon, which is $4 x 2 = $8. So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, we need to find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay. To do that, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

The boots work out to be $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, which is 20 feet off the ground. The beanstalk starts out 4 feet tall and doubles its height every day.

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 4: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

Since 32 feet is greater than 20 feet, the beanstalk will be taller than Mark's window on the 4th day.

"To find out how much protein John gets per week, we need to first find out how much protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find out how much protein is in 200 grams of mushrooms. 

We can do this by dividing 200 grams by 100 grams (the weight of one cup of mushrooms) to find out how many cups John eats per day. 

200 grams / 100 grams = 2 cups per day

Now, we know that one cup of mushrooms has 3 grams of protein. So, we multiply the number of cups John eats per day by the amount of protein in one cup.

2 cups * 3 grams/cup = 6 grams of protein per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the amount of protein John gets per day by 7.

6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

If Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, that means his current age is 2 times his age 5 years ago. 

Let's say Jerry's age 5 years ago was x. Then, his current age is 2x. 

We know that his current age is 2x, and we want to find his age in 3 years. To do that, we need to add 3 to his current age. 

So, his age in 3 years will be 2x + 3.

But we still need to find the value of x. We know that his current age is 2x, and we also know that his age 5 years ago was x. 

If we add 5 to his age 5 years ago (x), we get his current age (2x). 

So, x + 5 = 2x.

To find the value of x, we need to isolate x. We can do that by subtracting x from both sides of the equation. 

x + 5 - x = 2x - x
5 = x

Now that we know x is 5, we can find Jerry's age in 3 years by substituting x into the equation 2x + 3.

2(5) + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13

So, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

"To find out how many hours George needs to work, we need to know the total cost of the dental work and then divide that by his hourly wage.

First, let's find the total cost of the dental work. George needs 2 implants, and each implant costs $2000. So, 2 implants will cost 2 x $2000 = $4000.

One of the implants has a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost of the implants will be $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600. So, he still needs to pay $4500 - $600 = $3900.

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work, we need to divide the amount he still needs to pay ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15).

$3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's say the smallest angle is x. 

One angle is twice the smallest angle, so it's 2x. 
One angle is three times the smallest angle, so it's 3x.

We know that the three angles add up to 180 degrees. So, we can write an equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180.

Combine like terms: 6x = 180.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 30.

Now we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are 2x = 60 degrees and 3x = 90 degrees.

The largest angle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"Let's count the money Colby has. 

8 quarters are worth 8 x 25 cents = 200 cents. 
6 dimes are worth 6 x 10 cents = 60 cents. 
14 nickels are worth 14 x 5 cents = 70 cents. 
15 pennies are worth 15 x 1 cent = 15 cents.

Now, let's add all the money together: 200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents.

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can convert 345 cents to dollars by dividing by 100: 345 / 100 = 3.45 dollars.

Each gumball costs a nickel, which is 5 cents. To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to divide the total money by the cost of one gumball: 3.45 dollars * 100 cents/dollar = 345 cents. 345 cents / 5 cents = 69.

There are 2 cats, so the total number of cat legs is 2 x 4 = 8.
There are 10 birds, so the total number of bird legs is 10 x 2 = 20.

Now, we add up all the legs: 20 (dog legs) + 8 (cat legs) + 20 (bird legs) = 48.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Speed = 400 miles per hour

Now that we know the plane's speed, we can find out how many hours it would take to travel 2000 miles.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

So, it would take the plane 5 hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Next, we need to find out how many cups of lemonade Patrick sold in the next two hours. He sold 10 cups per hour for 2 hours, so we multiply 10 by 2. 10 * 2 = 20 cups.

Now, we need to find out the total number of cups of lemonade Patrick sold. We add the cups sold in the first four hours and the cups sold in the next two hours. 60 + 20 = 80 cups.

Now, we need to find out how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade. He sold 80 cups at $0.50 per cup for the first four hours, so we multiply 80 by 0.50. 80 * 0.50 = 40 dollars.

Now, we need to find out how many months the tire can last. 

Total rotations allowed = 10,440,000
Total rotations in a month = 290,000

Number of months the tire can last = Total rotations allowed / Total rotations in a month

$24.00 / 120 = $0.20 per washing.

Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, we need to divide $0.20 by 60 to get the cost per pump.

$0.20 / 60 = $0.003333... (this is a repeating decimal, but we can convert it to cents by multiplying by 100)

First, let's find out how many seats were occupied by the administrators. There are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, so the total number of seats is 4 x 18 = 72. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, so the number of seats occupied by the administrators is 72 / 4 = 18.

Now, we need to find out how many seats were occupied by the parents. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. The remaining seats after the administrators occupied 18 seats is 72 - 18 = 54. One-third of 54 is 54 / 3 = 18.

Now, we need to find out how many seats were occupied by the students. The total number of seats occupied by the administrators and the parents is 18 + 18 = 36. So, the number of seats occupied by the students is 72 - 36 = 36.

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total number of street lights, we need to multiply the number of poles at each intersection by the number of intersections. 

Number of poles at each intersection: 4
Number of intersections: 4

Total number of poles = Number of poles at each intersection * Number of intersections
Total number of poles = 4 * 4
Total number of poles = 16

Now, we need to subtract the number of non-functioning street lights from the total number of poles to find the number of functioning street lights.

Number of non-functioning street lights: 20

Total number of functioning street lights = Total number of poles - Number of non-functioning street lights
Total number of functioning street lights = 16 - 20

Since we can't have a negative number of street lights, it seems like there's an error in the problem. However, I will provide the answer as per the given information.

Total number of functioning street lights = -4"
"To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played, we need to add the number of times each DVD has been played so far and then subtract that from the total number of times each DVD can be played.

The first DVD has been played 356 times and can be played 1000 times in total. So, it can be played 1000 - 356 = 644 more times.

The second DVD has been played 135 times and can be played 1000 times in total. So, it can be played 1000 - 135 = 865 more times.

Now, we add the number of times each DVD can be played: 644 + 865 = 1509.

So, both DVDs can be played a total of 1509 times before they break.

The final answer is: 1509"
"To find out how much the physical therapy cost, we need to know how many hours John went to physical therapy. 

John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks. Each week, he went twice for 2 hours at a time. So, we multiply the number of weeks by the number of sessions per week and the number of hours per session.

6 weeks * 2 sessions per week = 12 sessions
12 sessions * 2 hours per session = 24 hours

Now, we multiply the total hours by the cost per hour to find the total cost.

24 hours * $125 per hour = $3000

The final answer is: $3000"
"Let's break down Jim's gum usage for the day.

Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since school lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

He also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner. So, that's 2 more pieces.

Now, Jim has 20 - 4 - 2 = 14 pieces of gum left.

He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 14 / 2 = 7.

So, Jim gives 7 pieces to his sister. He has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find out how old Charmaine will be 4 years from now, we need to know her current age. Since she will be 16 in 12 years, we can subtract 12 from 16 to find her current age.

16 (her age in 12 years) - 12 (years from now) = 4 (her current age)

Now, we need to add 4 years to her current age to find out how old she will be 4 years from now.

4 (her current age) + 4 (years from now) = 8

So, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we need to calculate how much each coach spent and then subtract the baseball coach's spending from the basketball coach's spending.

The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs for $3 each, so the baseball coach spent 9 x 3 = 27 dollars.

The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs for $14 each, so the basketball coach spent 8 x 14 = 112 dollars.

Now, we need to subtract the baseball coach's spending from the basketball coach's spending: 112 - 27 = 85.

The final answer is: 85"
"To find out how many flowers have bloomed, we need to know how many flowers are in the garden and then multiply that by the fraction that have bloomed. 

First, let's find out how many flowers are in the garden. There are 10 rows with 20 flowers in each row. 

10 rows * 20 flowers per row = 200 flowers in the garden.

Now, we know that 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed. To find out how many flowers have bloomed, we multiply the total number of flowers by 4/5.

200 flowers * 4/5 = 200 * 4 / 5 = 800 / 5 = 160

So, 160 flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb/s to Mb/s. 

Since 1 Mb has 1000 kb, we can convert 20 kb/s to Mb/s by dividing 20 by 1000. 

20 kb/s ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb/s

Now, we need to find out how many seconds are in an hour. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 x 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.

To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we multiply her speed in Mb/s by the number of seconds in an hour.

0.02 Mb/s x 3600 s/h = 72 Mb/h

The final answer is: 72"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

The tow truck pulled 10 cars for each of the first three days. So, the total number of cars it pulled in the first three days is 10 x 3 = 30.

The remaining days in the week are 7 - 3 = 4 days. On each of these days, it pulled 10 - 4 = 6 cars.

So, the total number of cars it pulled in the remaining 4 days is 6 x 4 = 24.

Now, we add the total number of cars it pulled in the first three days and the remaining 4 days. 30 + 24 = 54.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to subtract his current height from the height required to ride it and then divide by his growth rate.

The height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet, which is equal to 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches).

Adam's current height is 40 inches. 

So, the difference between the required height and Adam's current height is 48 - 40 = 8 inches.

Adam grows 2 inches a year. To find out how many years it will take for him to grow 8 inches, we divide 8 by 2.

8 / 2 = 4 years

So, it will take Adam 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break it down step by step.

James sold 10 cars that cost $25,000 each. So, the total cost of the cars is 10 x $25,000 = $250,000.

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars, which is 0.3 x $250,000 = $75,000. This means James sold the cars for $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

The profit is the amount James sold the cars for minus the cost of the cars, which is $175,000 - $250,000 = -$75,000. But, this is not possible because James can't make a negative amount of money. This means James actually made a loss.

However, let's continue with the problem to find out how much he made in commission.

James got a 10% commission on the profits. But, as we calculated earlier, he made a loss of $75,000. To find the commission, we need to find the profit first. Since he made a loss, we can say the profit is -$75,000.

Commission = 10% of -$75,000 = 0.1 x -$75,000 = -$7,500

So, James made a loss of $75,000 and his commission is -$7,500.

The final answer is: -$7,500"
"To find out how many men can stay upright, we first need to find out how many riders can stay upright. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we multiply 100 by 0.25.

100 * 0.25 = 25

Now, we know that 25 riders can stay upright. Out of these 25, 60% are women. To find out how many women are among them, we multiply 25 by 0.6.

25 * 0.6 = 15

Since the remaining riders are men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright.

25 - 15 = 10

So, 10 men can stay upright on the wave.

10"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know the price of a diamond Jewell is $2000. 

The price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond Jewell. 
So, the price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 * $2000 = $1600.

The cost of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of gold. 
So, the price of a silver Jewell is $1600 - $400 = $1200.

Now, we have the prices of all three jewels: 
- Diamond Jewell: $2000
- Gold Jewell: $1600
- Silver Jewell: $1200

To find the total price for all three jewels, we add their prices together: 
$2000 + $1600 + $1200 = $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. 
He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps. 
He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps. 

Now, we need to add up all the stamps. 
16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45 

The final answer is: 45"
"To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to find the time it takes for the distance between them to be zero.

First, we need to find the relative speed between Tom and Bob. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract their speeds. 

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph
Relative speed = -15 mph

Since speed can't be negative, we need to change the direction of the relative speed. We'll make it positive and change the direction to ""Tom is moving towards Bob"". 

Relative speed = 15 mph

Now, we need to find the time it takes for Tom to cover the initial distance of 75 miles at the relative speed of 15 mph.

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob. 

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know Naomi caught 17 fish.

"Let's break this down. Manny's parents will sign him up again if the cost per class is $10 or less. If there are 10 classes, and the total cost is $60, then the cost per class is $60 / 10 = $6. 

Since $6 is less than $10, Manny can miss some classes and still have a cost per class of $6 or less. If Manny misses x classes, then the number of classes he attends is 10 - x. The total cost will be the cost per class times the number of classes he attends, which is 6(10 - x). This total cost must be less than or equal to $60.

6(10 - x) ≤ 60

Now, let's solve for x.

60 - 6x ≤ 60
-6x ≤ 0
x ≥ 0

Since x is the number of classes Manny can miss, it can't be negative. So, x ≥ 0 is true for any number of classes. However, we need to find the maximum number of classes Manny can miss. 

Let's try to find the maximum value of x. We know that 6(10 - x) ≤ 60. We can set up an equation to find the maximum value of x.

6(10 - x) = 60
60 - 6x = 60
-6x = 0
x = 0

However, this is the minimum value of x. To find the maximum value of x, we need to find the value of x that makes 6(10 - x) equal to $60. 

6(10 - x) = 60
60 - 6x = 60
-6x = 0
x = 0

However, this is the same as the minimum value of x. This means that Manny can miss 0 classes and still have a cost per class of $6. To find the maximum number of classes Manny can miss, we need to find the value of x that makes 6(10 - x) just less than $60.

Let's try x = 1.

6(10 - 1) = 6(9) = 54
Since 54 is less than $60, Manny can miss 1 class.

Let's try x = 2.

6(10 - 2) = 6(8) = 48
Since 48 is less than $60, Manny can miss 2 classes.

Let's try x = 3.

6(10 - 3) = 6(7) = 42
Since 42 is less than $60, Manny can miss 3 classes.

Let's try x = 4.

6(10 - 4) = 6(6) = 36
Since 36 is less than $60, Manny can miss 4 classes.

Let's try x = 5.

6(10 - 5) = 6(5) = 30
Since 30 is less than $60, Manny can miss 5 classes.

Let's try x = 6.

6(10 - 6) = 6(4) = 24
Since 24 is less than $60, Manny can miss 6 classes.

Let's try x = 7.

6(10 - 7) = 6(3) = 18
Since 18 is less than $60, Manny can miss 7 classes.

Let's try x = 8.

6(10 - 8) = 6(2) = 12
Since 12 is less than $60, Manny can miss 8 classes.

Let's try x = 9.

6(10 - 9) = 6(1) = 6
Since 6 is less than $60, Manny can miss 9 classes.

Let's try x = 10.

6(10 - 10) = 6(0) = 0
Since 0 is less than $60, Manny can miss 10 classes.

However, Manny can't miss 10 classes because there are only 10 classes. So, the maximum number of classes Manny can miss is 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"If Jewel processes 50 customers a day, and Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, then Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers a day.

Since they work all 7 days of the week, the total number of customers processed by Jewel in a week is 50 * 7 = 350.

The total number of customers processed by Julie in a week is 100 * 7 = 700.

The total weekly production for the two is 350 + 700 = 1050.

"To find out how much Clyde will pay, we need to first find the cost of one apple and one orange. 

The cost of 4 apples is $5.20, so the cost of one apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30. 

The cost of 3 oranges is $3.30, so the cost of one orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Now, we need to find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges. The cost of 5 apples is 5 x $1.30 = $6.50. The cost of 5 oranges is 5 x $1.10 = $5.50.

So, the total cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges is $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

"To find the time it takes to dig the hole, we need to find the volume of the hole first. The formula for volume is length x width x height. 

Length (L) = 6 feet
Width (W) = 4 feet
Height (H) = 3 feet

Volume = L x W x H = 6 x 4 x 3 = 72 cubic feet

Now, we know it takes 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth. To find the total time, we multiply the volume by the time it takes to shovel 1 cubic foot.

Total time = Volume x Time per cubic foot = 72 x 3 = 216 seconds

The leather seats cost one-third of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards cost $500 less than the leather seats, which is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

"To find out how much Tim will make in a year, we need to first find out his new monthly salary and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's find his new monthly salary. He gets a 5% raise on his $20,000 a month salary. 

5% of $20,000 is 0.05 x $20,000 = $1,000. 

So, his new monthly salary is $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000.

He also gets a bonus worth half a month's salary. Half of $21,000 is $10,500.

So, his total monthly income is $21,000 + $10,500 = $31,500.

Now, let's multiply his total monthly income by 12 to find out how much he will make in a year.

$31,500 x 12 = $378,000.

The final answer is: $378,000."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know James buys 10 suits. Each suit costs $750. So, the total cost of the suits is 10 x $750 = $7500.

Next, we know the dress pants cost 1/5 of the cost of a suit. Since a suit costs $750, the dress pants cost $750 / 5 = $150 each.

James buys 10 dress pants, so the total cost of the dress pants is 10 x $150 = $1500.

Now, James buys 3 dress shirts per suit. Since he buys 10 suits, he buys 10 x 3 = 30 dress shirts. Each dress shirt costs $60, so the total cost of the dress shirts is 30 x $60 = $1800.

To find the total cost of everything, we add the cost of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts together: $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

"To find out how much flour was in three bags before it was divided, we need to know how much flour was in one bag and then multiply it by 3.

Since the bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, we can find the total weight of one bag by multiplying the number of portions by the weight of each portion.

Weight of one portion = 2 kilograms
Number of portions in one bag = 8

Weight of one bag = Weight of one portion * Number of portions in one bag
Weight of one bag = 2 * 8
Weight of one bag = 16 kilograms

Now, we need to find the total weight of three bags.
Weight of three bags = Weight of one bag * 3
Weight of three bags = 16 * 3
Weight of three bags = 48 kilograms

"To find the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to find out how long it takes him to dig through the soil and the clay separately, and then add those times together.

First, let's find out how long it takes him to dig through the soil. He can dig 4 feet/hour through soil, and he has to dig 24 feet of soil. 

Time to dig through soil = Total feet of soil / Feet dug per hour = 24 / 4 = 6 hours

Now, let's find out how long it takes him to dig through the clay. He can dig half as fast through clay as he can through soil, so he can dig 4 / 2 = 2 feet/hour through clay. He has to dig 8 feet of clay.

Time to dig through clay = Total feet of clay / Feet dug per hour = 8 / 2 = 4 hours

"Let's break it down step by step.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. But she got a $2 discount. So, the total cost for 20 pomegranates is 20 x 20 = $400. Then, she got a $2 discount, so the final cost is $400 - $2 = $398.

On the second day, the price of each pomegranate is $30, and there's a 10% discount on the total cost. So, the total cost for 20 pomegranates is 20 x 30 = $600. The 10% discount is 10% of $600, which is 0.1 x 600 = $60. So, the final cost is $600 - $60 = $540.

Now, let's find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days. The difference is $540 - $398 = $142.

"To find out how many deviled egg halves Lori's guests will eat, we need to multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat. 

Number of guests: 16
Number of deviled egg halves per guest: 3

Total deviled egg halves: 16 * 3 = 48

Since Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many deviled egg halves 1 egg can make. 

1 egg = 2 deviled egg halves

Now, we need to find out how many eggs Lori needs to make 48 deviled egg halves. 

48 deviled egg halves / 2 deviled egg halves per egg = 24 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Lori needs.

24 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 2 dozens

So, Lori needs 2 dozens of eggs.

1/3 of 15 is 15 / 3 = 5 pages.

So, Shiela has already written 5 pages. To find out how many pages she has left, we need to subtract 5 from the total number of pages.

15 - 5 = 10

Shiela has 10 pages left to write."
"To find out how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day.

Total pages = 200
Pages read per day = 10

Days to finish the book = Total pages / Pages read per day
Days to finish the book = 200 / 10
Days to finish the book = 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we need to subtract the number of days it will take him to finish the book from the total number of days.

Days before the deadline = Total days - Days to finish the book
Days before the deadline = 30 - 20
Days before the deadline = 10

"To find out how much it cost James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the total cost of the plane and the total cost of the hanger and fuel for a year.

The plane cost $150,000. 

The hanger rent is $5000 a month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total hanger rent for a year is $5000 * 12 = $60,000.

The fuel cost is twice as much as the hanger rent, so it's $5000 * 2 = $10,000 a month. The total fuel cost for a year is $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

The total cost of the plane and the hanger and fuel for a year is $150,000 (plane) + $60,000 (hanger) + $120,000 (fuel) = $230,000.

The final answer is: $230,000"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice. Since it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, it took her 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook pork.

We are also told that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of 80 is 40 minutes, so it took Finley 40 minutes to cook beans.

To find the total time it took to cook all the food, we need to add the cooking times of rice, pork, and beans. 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost of the mixtures, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference.

For the first mixture, we have 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. 

Cost of almonds in the first mixture = (1/2) * $10 = $5
Cost of walnuts in the first mixture = (1/3) * $15 = $5
Total cost of the first mixture = $5 + $5 = $10

For the second mixture, we have 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

Cost of almonds in the second mixture = (1/5) * $10 = $2
Cost of walnuts in the second mixture = (1/3) * $15 = $5
Total cost of the second mixture = $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures.

Difference in cost = Cost of the first mixture - Cost of the second mixture
= $10 - $7
= $3

The final answer is: $3"
"Let's break this problem down. We know that sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. Let's say the number of sheep is S and the number of geese is G.

We know that the total number of animal legs is 70, so we can write an equation: 4S + 2G = 70.

We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, and since each animal has one head, we can write another equation: S + G = 20.

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for S by substituting the second equation into the first one. 

First, we'll multiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of G the same in both equations: 2S + 2G = 40.

Now we can subtract this equation from the first one: (4S + 2G) - (2S + 2G) = 70 - 40, which simplifies to 2S = 30.

Now we can solve for S by dividing both sides by 2: S = 30 / 2 = 15.

"To find out how much everything cost, we need to find out how much the more expensive coffee cost, and then add the cost of the donut.

First, we need to find out how many pounds of coffee Roger buys.  He uses 1 pound of coffee per day, and he buys a week's worth of coffee.  There are 7 days in a week, so he buys 7 pounds of coffee.

The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound, but the more expensive brand costs 20% more.  To find out how much the more expensive brand costs, we need to find 20% of $5 and add it to $5.

20% of $5 is 0.2 x $5 = $1.  So the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Now we can find out how much the more expensive coffee costs.  Roger buys 7 pounds of coffee, and each pound costs $6.  So the total cost of the coffee is 7 x $6 = $42.

The cost of the donut is $2.  To find out the total cost, we add the cost of the coffee and the cost of the donut: $42 + $2 = $44.

The final answer is: $44"
"To find out how much the apple pie cost, we need to know the total amount Gus spent and subtract the cost of the items we know. 

First, let's add up the cost of the items we know: 
2 bags of chips for $2.00 each is 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
Adding the cost of the fried chicken, $4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00
Adding the cost of the soda, $12.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Now, we know Gus spent $20.00 in total. To find the cost of the apple pie, we subtract the total cost of the items we know from the total amount spent: 
$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The apple pie cost $7.00."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers he delivers to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers he delivers in a day.

Total newspapers delivered = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered - (Newspapers delivered to District A + Newspapers delivered to District C)
= 600 - (198 + 209)
= 600 - 407
= 193

The final answer is: 193"
"To find out how many recipes John learns, we need to know how many hours of class time he has in total. 

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so that's 4 x 2 = 8 hours per week. 

Since the class is for 6 weeks, we multiply the hours per week by the number of weeks: 8 hours/week x 6 weeks = 48 hours.

John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. To find out how many recipes he learns, we divide the total hours by 1.5: 48 hours / 1.5 hours/recipe = 32 recipes.

The final answer is: 32"
"First, we need to find out how many math teachers are on the court. Since 60% of the teachers are history teachers, that means 40% are math teachers. 

To find 40% of 150, we multiply 150 by 0.4. 

150 * 0.4 = 60

So, there are 60 math teachers on the court. 

Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours they sleep per day.

60 * 6 = 360

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Aurelia has $120. 
Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia. 
3/4 * 120 = 90. 
So, Kassidy has $90. 

Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. 
90 + 60 = 150. 
So, Rayna has $150. 

Now, let's add their money together. 
120 + 90 + 150 = 360. 

If they share this money equally among them, we need to divide 360 by 3. 
360 / 3 = 120.

"To find out how many employees oversee the company, we need to first find out how many employees are in management. 

20% of 50 employees are in management. To find 20% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.2. 

50 * 0.2 = 10

So, 10 employees are in management. 

Out of these 10 employees, 30% oversee the entire company. To find 30% of 10, we multiply 10 by 0.3.

10 * 0.3 = 3

So, 3 employees oversee the company.

"To find out how many tablespoons of dry ingredients Svetlana would need, we need to find out how many tablespoons of flour, sugar, and salt she needs for 16 muffins. 

For flour, she needs 5 tablespoons per muffin, so for 16 muffins, she would need 5 x 16 = 80 tablespoons of flour.

For sugar, she needs 3 tablespoons per muffin, so for 16 muffins, she would need 3 x 16 = 48 tablespoons of sugar.

For salt, she needs 0.25 tablespoons per muffin, so for 16 muffins, she would need 0.25 x 16 = 4 tablespoons of salt.

Now, we need to add up the total amount of dry ingredients she needs. 80 (flour) + 48 (sugar) + 4 (salt) = 132 tablespoons.

"Let's break it down. Janey has 21 books, and it's said that she has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has. 

Let's say Sally has x books. Then, twice the number of books Sally has would be 2x. Since Janey has 3 more than that, we can write an equation: 2x + 3 = 21.

To find x, we need to solve for x. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 21 - 3, which is 2x = 18.

Now, we need to divide both sides by 2 to find x: x = 18 / 2, which is x = 9.

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches, we need to know how much more it needs to grow. 

First, we need to convert the height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 20 feet is 20 x 12 = 240 inches.

Now, we need to find out how much more the bamboo needs to grow. We subtract the current height from the target height: 600 - 240 = 360 inches.

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches a day, we can divide the remaining height by the growth rate to find out how many days it will take: 360 / 30 = 12.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs. This means each dog has 1 toy. 

When he goes back to the shelter, there are 8 more dogs, so now he has 4 + 8 = 12 dogs. Since each dog needs 1 toy, he needs 12 toys.

But then, he finds out there are twice as many more dogs than when he left, which means there are 2 * 8 = 16 more dogs. So now he has 12 + 16 = 28 dogs. He needs 28 toys.

However, when he comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys. 

So, James needs 28 - 3 = 25 toys in total.

First, Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount. The total amount is $1200. 

2/5 of $1200 is 2/5 * 1200 = 480. 

So, Dylan invested $480. 

Now, the remaining amount is $1200 - $480 = $720. 

Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, which is 2/3 * $720 = $480. 

So, Frances also invested $480.

"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we need to know how much she earns per hour and then multiply it by the number of hours she works in two days.

Lorie earns $10 per hour. Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, so Karen earns 2 x $10 = $20 per hour.

Now, we need to find out how many hours Karen works in two days. She works 3 hours per day, so in two days, she works 2 x 3 = 6 hours.

To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we multiply her hourly wage by the number of hours she works: $20 x 6 = $120.

"To find out how much they will exceed the maximum load, we need to find the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults, and then subtract the maximum load of the elevator.

First, we need to find the total weight of the 8 adults. Since each adult weighs 80 kg, we multiply 8 by 80.

8 x 80 = 640 kg

Now, we add Jack's weight to the total weight of the 8 adults. Since Jack is also an adult, he weighs 80 kg.

640 + 80 = 720 kg

Now, we subtract the maximum load of the elevator from the total weight of Jack and the 8 adults.

720 - 700 = 20 kg

So, they will exceed the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Katarina has 68 cookies. We know she has 5 less cookies than Max. So, Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

We also know Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. But we don't know how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. Let's call it x. So, Max has x + 12 cookies.

Since Max has 73 cookies, we can set up the equation: x + 12 = 73. To find x, we subtract 12 from both sides: x = 73 - 12, x = 61. The Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. Max has 73 cookies, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, let's add up the total number of cookies: Katarina has 68, Max has 73, the Cookie Monster has 61, and Summer has 96. 

68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that the final design is 140cm long. We also know that Shania added 20cm to the bottom of the dress. 

So, before adding the 20cm, the dress was 140cm - 20cm = 120cm long.

Now, we know that this 120cm is 150% of the original length (100% + 50% extension). 

Let's call the original length 'x'. Then, 150% of x is 120cm. 

We can write this as an equation: 1.5x = 120cm.

To find the original length, we need to divide both sides by 1.5. 

x = 120cm / 1.5
x = 80cm

"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know Chris can mow the whole lawn in 1 hour in turtle mode. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, it takes him 60 minutes to mow the whole lawn in turtle mode.

We also know it takes him 40 minutes to mow the whole lawn in rabbit mode.

Now, Chris mowed half the lawn in turtle mode and half in rabbit mode. This means he mowed half the lawn in 60 minutes (turtle mode) and the other half in 40 minutes (rabbit mode).

To find the total time, we need to add the time it took to mow each half of the lawn. 

Time to mow half the lawn in turtle mode = 60 minutes
Time to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode = 40 minutes

Total time = 60 + 40 = 100 minutes

"Let's say the age of the triplet is x. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the other twin's age would be x + 7.

We have two sets of siblings, so we can write an equation to represent their combined ages: x + (x + 7) + x = 44.

Combine like terms: 3x + 7 = 44.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 37.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 12.33.

Since the triplet's age is 12.33, the other twin's age would be 12.33 + 7 = 19.33.

One of the twins is 19.33 years old.

First, let's find out the cost of the candies. Manolo bought 4 candies for $3.20. To find the cost of one candy, we need to divide the total cost by the number of candies. 

Cost of one candy = Total cost of candies / Number of candies
Cost of one candy = $3.20 / 4
Cost of one candy = $0.80

Now, we know the cost of one candy is $0.80. We also know the cost of one lollipop is $0.40. 

To find the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we need to multiply the cost of one lollipop by 10 and the cost of one candy by 10, then add them together.

Cost of 10 lollipops = Cost of one lollipop * 10
Cost of 10 lollipops = $0.40 * 10
Cost of 10 lollipops = $4

Cost of 10 candies = Cost of one candy * 10
Cost of 10 candies = $0.80 * 10

Rong saves 20 coins every month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so we need to find 2/5 of 20. 

2/5 of 20 is 8. So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins every month.

Now, let's find out how many months are in 10 years. There are 12 months in a year, so 10 years will have 10 x 12 = 120 months.

Rong saves 20 coins every month, so in 120 months, he will save 20 x 120 = 2400 coins.

Neil saves 28 coins every month, so in 120 months, he will save 28 x 120 = 3360 coins.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to find the total cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, and each vaccine costs $20. So, the total cost of the vaccines is 2 x $20 = $40.

Next, we need to find the cost of the heartworm check. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill ""x"". Then, the cost of the heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. So, we can write an equation: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 0.6x from both sides of the equation: x - 0.6x = $40. This simplifies to 0.4x = $40.

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.4 to solve for x: x = $40 / 0.4 = $100.

So, the total bill is $100. The heartworm check costs 60% of the total bill, which is 0.6 x $100 = $60.

The total cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check is $40 + $60 = $100.

"To find the price of the crate, we need to find the total cost of all the fruits in it. 

First, we need to find the cost of one banana. Since one apple costs $0.5 and one banana costs twice as much as an apple, the cost of one banana is 2 * $0.5 = $1.

Next, we need to find the cost of one orange. Since one orange costs three times as much as a banana, the cost of one orange is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, we can find the total cost of the fruits in one crate. There are 5 bananas, so the cost of the bananas is 5 * $1 = $5. There are 12 apples, so the cost of the apples is 12 * $0.5 = $6. There are 7 oranges, so the cost of the oranges is 7 * $3 = $21.

The total cost of the crate is the sum of the cost of the bananas, apples, and oranges. So, the total cost is $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so there are 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.
There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so there are 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, we need to find the total number of squares. We add the number of red, blue, green, and white squares together: 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 squares.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

1. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. Adam has 50 points. 30% of 50 is 0.3 x 50 = 15. So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

2. Tom has 30 points less than Betty. Betty has 65 points. So, Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

3. Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. Tom has 35 points. So, Marta has 3 x 35 = 105 points.

4. Now, let's add up the points of Adam, Betty, Marta, and Tom. Adam has 50 points, Betty has 65 points, Marta has 105 points, and Tom has 35 points. 50 + 65 + 105 + 35 = 255 points.

5. The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. The class has 255 points. To find out how many points they are missing, we subtract 255 from 400. 400 - 255 = 145 points.

The final answer is: 145"

"To find out how much money Greta has left, we need to first calculate how much she puts into her retirement account and her car payment.

Greta puts 50% of her paycheck into her retirement account. 50% of $2400 is 0.5 x 2400 = $1200.

Then, she uses 20% of her paycheck to make her car payment. 20% of $2400 is 0.2 x 2400 = $480.

Now, we need to subtract the money she put into her retirement account and her car payment from her total paycheck. 

$2400 - $1200 - $480 = $720.

So, Greta has $720 left to spend. 

The final answer is: $720."
"To find out how many pairs of pencils are in the box, we need to know how many pencils are left in the box. 

There are 20 pencils in the box and 4 pencils are missing. So, we subtract 4 from 20 to find out how many pencils are left.

20 - 4 = 16

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of pencils are in the box. Since a pair is 2 pencils, we divide the number of pencils left by 2.

16 / 2 = 8

So, there are 8 pairs of pencils in the box.

"To find out how many fireworks Hannah will see, we need to find out how many fireworks the city will set off and then multiply that by 40%. 

The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each. So, the total number of fireworks the city will set off is 15 x 20 = 300.

Now, we need to find 40% of 300. To do that, we multiply 300 by 0.4. 300 x 0.4 = 120.

Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard. So, she will set off 3 x 5 = 15 fireworks.

Now, we add the number of fireworks Hannah will see from the city (120) and the number of fireworks she will set off in her backyard (15). 120 + 15 = 135.

"To find out how much money the group spent on snacks and drinks, we need to know how many seats, drinks, and snacks they bought. 

There are 12 friends going to the cinema with Aiden, and 7 more friends meet up with them. So, the total number of friends is 12 + 7 = 19. 

Since each seat can hold one person, they bought 19 seats. 

Each seat can hold 2 drinks, so they bought 19 * 2 = 38 drinks. 

Each seat can hold 3 snacks, so they bought 19 * 3 = 57 snacks.

Drinks and snacks cost $2 each. So, the total cost of drinks is 38 * $2 = $76. 

The total cost of snacks is 57 * $2 = $114.

The total cost of snacks and drinks is $76 + $114 = $190.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, which can haul 4,000 pounds. So, Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

Now, we know that when Gary joins Gissela and Gordy, the three trucks can haul a total of 11,600 pounds. We already know that Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds and Gordy's truck can haul 4,800 pounds. 

So, the total weight that Gissela and Gordy's trucks can haul is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds. 

Now, we need to find out how much Gary's truck can haul. We know that the total weight that all three trucks can haul is 11,600 pounds. So, the weight that Gary's truck can haul is 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

The final answer is: 2800"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know there are 8 males and 6 females. So, the total number of people is 8 + 6 = 14.

Each female ate 3 dumplings, and there are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 x 3 = 18.

Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 x 4 = 32.

The total number of dumplings eaten is 18 (by females) + 32 (by males) = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much money Gerald had left, we need to first find out how much money he got from the $100. 

The ratio of the money Gerald and Julia got is 3:2. This means that for every 3 parts Gerald got, Julia got 2 parts. The total parts are 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

Since Gerald got 3 parts, we can find out how much 1 part is by dividing $100 by 5. 

$100 / 5 = $20

So, 1 part is $20. Gerald got 3 parts, so he got 3 x $20 = $60.

Gerald spent $10 on a book, so to find out how much he has left, we need to subtract $10 from $60.

$60 - $10 = $50

So, Gerald has $50 left. 

The final answer is: $50"
"If Martha's cat is 5 times faster than her turtle, that means the turtle is 1/5 as fast as the cat. 

Since the cat can run 15 feet/second, the turtle can crawl 15 / 5 = 3 feet/second.

To find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we multiply the turtle's speed by the time: 3 feet/second * 40 seconds = 120 feet.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how many hours they have to fundraise, we need to know how much more money they need to raise. They need to raise $6300 - $2100 = $4200 more.

Since they raise an equal amount of money every hour, we can divide the amount they need to raise by the amount they raise per hour. We know they raised $2100 in 3 hours, so we can find the amount they raise per hour by dividing $2100 by 3.

$2100 / 3 = $700 per hour.

Now, we can divide the amount they need to raise ($4200) by the amount they raise per hour ($700) to find out how many hours they have to fundraise.

$4200 / $700 = 6 hours.

So, they have to fundraise for 6 more hours.

"To find the percent of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percent of the river's total water used by the city, and then subtract the percent used for industrial purposes.

The city uses 40% of the river's water. 

80% of that 40% is used for industrial purposes. To find 80% of 40%, we multiply 40 by 0.8. 

40 * 0.8 = 32

So, 32% of the river's water is used for industrial purposes by the city.

To find the percent used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percent used for industrial purposes from the total percent used by the city.

40 - 32 = 8

So, 8% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. To find out how many quarts it makes in one hour, we divide 100 by 2. 

100 / 2 = 50 quarts of chocolate ice cream per hour.

The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. To find out how many quarts it makes in one hour, we divide 50 by 4.

50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts of vanilla ice cream per hour.

Now, we add the quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream made per hour to find the total quarts made per hour.

50 (chocolate) + 12.5 (vanilla) = 62.5 quarts per hour.

To find the total quarts made in 48 hours, we multiply 62.5 by 48.

First, we need to find out how many slices Bryce and two friends ate. Since there are 5 people in total, and 3 of them ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we can say that 3 people ate 2/3 of their pizzas. 

3 people * 2/3 = 6/3 = 2 pizzas. 

Since each pizza has 12 slices, 2 pizzas will have 2 * 12 = 24 slices. 

Now, we need to find out how many slices the two remaining friends ate. They ate 3/4 of their pizzas. Since there are 2 friends, we can say that 2 friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas. 

2 friends * 3/4 = 6/4 = 1.5 pizzas. 

Since each pizza has 12 slices, 1.5 pizzas will have 1.5 * 12 = 18 slices. 

Now, we need to add the slices eaten by Bryce and his friends and the slices eaten by the two remaining friends. 

24 slices + 18 slices = 42 slices. 

Now, we need to find out how many slices were left. There were a total of 5 people, and each person got 1 pizza. So, there were 5 pizzas in total. Each pizza has 12 slices, so there were 5 * 12 = 60 slices in total.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 8 feet is 8 x 12 = 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, we get 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's call the length of one of Bobby's shoes 'x'. Then, 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 9x. The length of one of Topher's shoes is 9x + 10.

We know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches, so we can set up the equation: 9x + 10 = 100.

Now, we need to solve for x. Subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 9x = 100 - 10, 9x = 90.

Now, divide both sides of the equation by 9: x = 90 / 9, x = 10.

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Candidate A got 20% of the votes. To find out how many votes that is, we need to calculate 20% of 100. 

20% of 100 is 0.2 x 100 = 20 votes. 

Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes. To find out how many votes candidate B got, we need to add 50% of candidate A's votes to candidate A's votes. 

50% of 20 votes is 0.5 x 20 = 10 votes. 

So, candidate B got 20 + 10 = 30 votes. 

The rest of the votes were given to candidate C. To find out how many votes candidate C got, we need to subtract candidate A and B's votes from the total number of votes. 

Candidate A and B got 20 + 30 = 50 votes. 

So, candidate C got 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Boris has 100 apples. Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

Boris gives Beck 10 apples, so now Beck has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris. Boris still has 100 apples, and Beck has 87 apples. So, the difference is 100 - 87 = 13.

"To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate how much water he used to make the giant, medium, and small cubes.

For the giant cubes, he used 4 ounces per cube and made 3 cubes. So, 4 * 3 = 12 ounces of water were used for the giant cubes.

For the medium cubes, he used 2 ounces per cube and made 7 cubes. So, 2 * 7 = 14 ounces of water were used for the medium cubes.

For the small cubes, he used 1/2 ounce per cube and made 8 cubes. So, 1/2 * 8 = 4 ounces of water were used for the small cubes.

Now, let's add up the total amount of water used: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces.

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how much water he has left, we subtract the amount used from the total: 32 - 30 = 2 ounces.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know that a gallon jar costs $5. We also know that a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. 

So, if a gallon jar costs $5, then a half-gallon jar must cost $5 - $2 = $3.

Now, we need to find out how much 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars cost. 

10-gallon jars will cost 10 x $5 = $50. 

16 half-gallon jars will cost 16 x $3 = $48.

To find the total amount of money she spent, we need to add the cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars. 

$50 + $48 = $98.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that 10 students like to bake and 5 like to play basketball. So, the total number of students who like to bake or play basketball is 10 + 5 = 15.

Since there are 50 students in total, and 15 like to bake or play basketball, the number of students who like to play video games or play music is 50 - 15 = 35.

We are also told that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball. So, the number of students who like to play music is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we know that the total number of students who like to play video games or play music is 35, and the number who like to play music is 10. So, the number of students who like to play video games is 35 - 10 = 25.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that there are 80 students in total and that each class has the same number of students. So, if we let x be the number of students in each class, we can say that 2x = 80 (since there are two classes).

To find x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 2. 

2x = 80
x = 80 / 2
x = 40

So, each class has 40 students.

Now, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we need to calculate 40% of 40.

40% of 40 = (40/100) * 40
= 0.4 * 40
= 16

Since there are 40 students in each class and 16 are girls, the number of boys in each class is 40 - 16 = 24.

"To find the profit, we need to first find the total cost and the total value of the cards.

Mark bought 3 packs for $1800 each, so the total cost is 3 x $1800 = $5400.

He got 1 card worth $4000 and another card worth $1000. So, the total value of these two cards is $4000 + $1000 = $6000.

There are 30 more cards worth an average of $50 each, so the total value of these cards is 30 x $50 = $1500.

The total value of all the cards is $6000 + $1500 = $7500.

The profit is the total value of the cards minus the total cost, which is $7500 - $5400 = $2100.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

We know Sean has 56 marbles. 

Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, Cal must have twice as many marbles as Sean. 
So, Cal has 56 * 2 = 112 marbles.

We also know Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. 
So, Carl has 56 * 4 = 224 marbles.

Now, we need to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined. 
To do that, we add the number of marbles Carl and Cal have. 
Carl has 224 marbles and Cal has 112 marbles.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. 

First, she trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 30 is 0.9 x 30 = 27. So, she trades 27 small stickers for large buttons. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons.

Now, she has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 x 40 = 20. So, she trades 20 large stickers for large buttons. Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

Now, she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 x 3 = 60 small buttons.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

There are 33 people on the council. Let's say the number of votes against the new regulation is x. 

Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice as many as the votes against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and against, which is 33. So, we can write the equation: x + 2x = 33.

Combine like terms: 3x = 33.

Now, divide both sides by 3: x = 11.

Since the number of votes in favor is 2x, we multiply x by 2: 2 * 11 = 22.

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

After that, half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large. 
Lastly, six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large. 

Now, let's add up the total number of students: 11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75 students.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Let's say the second house needs x cases of shingles. Then the first house needs 1/2 of x, which is x/2. 

The total number of cases for the first and second house is x + x/2. To add these, we need to get a common denominator, which is 2. So, it becomes 2x/2 + x/2 = 3x/2.

The third house needs double the first house, which is 2 * x/2 = x.

The total number of cases for all three houses is 250. So, we can set up the equation: 3x/2 + x = 250.

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying both sides by 2, which gives us 3x + 2x = 500.

Now, we can combine like terms: 5x = 500.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 5: x = 100.

Now that we know the second house needs 100 cases of shingles, we can find out how many the third house needs. The third house needs x cases, which is 100.

The third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

"To find out how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to drive to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

First, let's find out how long it takes for Jack to drive to the museum. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed. 

The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and Jack drives at 75 mph. 

time_to_museum = distance / speed = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Since Jack has to drive back home, we need to multiply the time it takes to drive to the museum by 2.

Next, let's find out how many of the remaining movies are older movies. 40% of 400 is 0.4 x 400 = 160 movies.

Now, let's find out how many movies are not older movies. 400 - 160 = 240 movies.

The cost of the series movies is 200 x $6 = $1200.

The cost of the older movies is 160 x $5 = $800.

The cost of the normal movies is 240 x $10 = $2400.

The total cost is $1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400.

The final answer is: $4400"
"To find out how much Winston spent, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

Winston picked 6 pounds of peaches for $2.00 per pound, so the cost of peaches is 6 x $2.00 = $12.00.

He picked 8 pounds of plums for $1.00 per pound, so the cost of plums is 8 x $1.00 = $8.00.

He picked 6 pounds of apricots for $3.00 per pound, so the cost of apricots is 6 x $3.00 = $18.00.

Now, we add the cost of peaches, plums, and apricots together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00.

The final answer is: $38.00"
"To find the distance, we need to find the total time they spent driving and hiking, then multiply it by their average speed. 

First, let's find the speed at which they hiked. They drove at 50 miles per hour, and they hiked 5 miles per hour less than half their speed. Half of 50 is 25, and 5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour, so the distance they hiked is 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

They drove for 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours at 50 miles per hour. The distance they drove is 50 * 4.5 = 225 miles.

The total distance is 30 + 225 = 255 miles.

The final answer is: 255"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, and Emma collects 3 more berries than Ava. 

Let's say Emma jumps on x enemies and collects y berries. Then Ava jumps on x + 8 enemies and collects y - 3 berries.

They both get 30 points for every second left on the timer. Let's say Emma finishes the level in z seconds. Then Ava finishes the level in z + 4 seconds.

Emma's score = 10x + 5y + 30z
Ava's score = 10(x + 8) + 5(y - 3) + 30(z + 4)

Simplifying the equations:
Emma's score = 10x + 5y + 30z
Ava's score = 10x + 80 + 5y - 15 + 30z + 120
Ava's score = 10x + 5y + 30z + 85

Now, let's find the difference between their scores:
Difference = Ava's score - Emma's score
Difference = (10x + 5y + 30z + 85) - (10x + 5y + 30z)
Difference = 85

The final answer is: 85"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars each. So, the total cost of these two pizzas is 2 x 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we know that the total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars. To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that we already know from the total cost.

So, the cost of the other two pizzas is 64 - 60 = 4 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can divide the cost by 2 to find the cost of one pizza.

4 / 2 = 2 dollars.

The final answer is: 2"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

Chase and Rider ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days. That's 3 * 5 = 15 times. 

Then, they ride twice the times they do on usual days for 2 other days. They ride 3 times a day on usual days, so they ride 3 * 2 = 6 times a day on those 2 days. For 2 days, that's 6 * 2 = 12 times.

Now, we add the times they ride on usual days and the times they ride on the other 2 days. 15 + 12 = 27.

So, they ride their bikes 27 times a week.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

Bob initially had 7 fish in his pond, with 3 being orange and 4 being white. 

When he went to the pet store, the sales assistant took out 17 fish from the mixed tank. We don't know how many of these 17 fish were orange or white, but we do know that when Bob added them to his pond, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's say the number of white fish Bob bought at the store is x. Then, the number of orange fish he bought is also x, because he ended up with twice as many orange fish as white fish.

The total number of fish in the pond after Bob added the new fish is 7 (initial fish) + 17 (new fish) = 24.

We know that the number of white fish in the pond is 4 (initial white fish) + x (white fish bought at the store). The number of orange fish in the pond is 3 (initial orange fish) + x (orange fish bought at the store).

Since Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation: 3 + x = 2(4 + x).

Simplifying the equation, we get 3 + x = 8 + 2x.

Subtracting x from both sides, we get 3 = 8 + x.

Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get -5 = x.

But x can't be negative because you can't buy a negative number of fish. This means our initial assumption that the number of orange fish Bob bought is x is incorrect.

Let's try again. Let's say the number of white fish Bob bought at the store is x. Then, the number of orange fish he bought is 2x, because he ended up with twice as many orange fish as white fish.

"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total miles driven per week and then multiply it by the cost of gas per gallon.

First, let's find out how many miles Andy drives per week. Since he drives to work and back home every day from Monday to Friday, the total miles driven per day is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles. 

Now, let's multiply the miles driven per day by the number of working days in a week: 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Since Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, we can find out how many gallons of gas he uses per week by dividing the total miles driven per week by his car's fuel efficiency: 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

Now, let's multiply the gallons of gas used per week by the cost of gas per gallon: 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

The final answer is: $15"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much money Carrie had in total. She was given 10 twenties and 140 quarters. 

Each twenty is worth 20 dollars, so 10 twenties are worth 10 x 20 = 200 dollars. 

Each quarter is worth 0.25 dollars, so 140 quarters are worth 140 x 0.25 = 35 dollars. 

Now, we add the value of the twenties and the quarters to find the total amount of money Carrie had. 200 + 35 = 235 dollars.

Carrie spent all the quarters, which is 35 dollars, and 3/5 of the twenties. 3/5 of 200 is 3/5 x 200 = 120 dollars. 

So, Carrie spent 35 + 120 = 155 dollars in total.

"To find the total number of fruits, we need to find the total number of tomatoes and the total number of eggplants. 

First, let's find the total number of tomatoes. Ricardo planted 5 tomato plants and each plant yields 22 tomatoes. So, the total number of tomatoes is 5 x 22 = 110.

Next, let's find the total number of eggplants. Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants and each plant yields 4 eggplants. So, the total number of eggplants is 8 x 4 = 32.

Now, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits. 110 + 32 = 142.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that one-fourth of the TVs sold are smart TVs. To find out how many smart TVs were sold, we need to multiply the total number of TVs by one-fourth. 

One-fourth is the same as 1/4 or 0.25. So, we multiply 40 by 0.25 to get the number of smart TVs sold. 

40 * 0.25 = 10 smart TVs sold.

Next, we know that one-eighth of the TVs sold are analog TVs. To find out how many analog TVs were sold, we need to multiply the total number of TVs by one-eighth. 

One-eighth is the same as 1/8 or 0.125. So, we multiply 40 by 0.125 to get the number of analog TVs sold. 

40 * 0.125 = 5 analog TVs sold.

Now, we know that the rest of the TVs sold are OLED TVs. To find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we need to subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total number of TVs.

Total TVs = 40
Smart TVs = 10
Analog TVs = 5

OLED TVs = Total TVs - (Smart TVs + Analog TVs)
OLED TVs = 40 - (10 + 5)
OLED TVs = 40 - 15
OLED TVs = 25

The number of OLED TVs sold is 25."
"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to know how much the school is covering and how much the trip costs. The school is covering half the cost of the trip, which is $300 / 2 = $150. 

Since John already has $50, we need to subtract that from the total cost of the trip to find out how much he still needs. 

$300 (total cost) - $150 (school's contribution) = $150 (John's share)
$150 (John's share) - $50 (John's money) = $100 (money John is missing)

Now, we need to find out how many logs Carson needs to burn to get the temperature from 12 to 32 degrees. We know that every log heats the house up by 5 degrees. 

To find out how many logs Carson needs, we divide the difference between the temperature we want (32) and the current temperature (12) by the amount of heat one log gives (5).

(32 - 12) / 5 = 20 / 5 = 4

So, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

"To find out how many seashells they brought, we need to find out how many groups had members bring back seashells and how many seashells each group brought.

First, we need to find out how many groups were formed. Since 90 people were split into 9-person groups, we can divide 90 by 9 to find the number of groups.

90 / 9 = 10

So, there were 10 groups. 

Now, we need to find out how many groups had members bring back seashells. 3/5 of the groups had members bring back seashells. 

3/5 * 10 = 6

So, 6 groups had members bring back seashells.

Each group brought back 2 seashells. To find out how many seashells they brought in total, we multiply the number of groups that brought seashells by the number of seashells each group brought.

6 * 2 = 12

"To find out how many people are on the train, we need to do some math. 

First, we start with 172 people on the train. 

At the first stop, 47 people get off, so we subtract 47 from 172. That's 172 - 47 = 125 people left on the train. 

Then, 13 more people get on the train, so we add 13 to 125. That's 125 + 13 = 138 people on the train.

At the next stop, 38 people get off, so we subtract 38 from 138. That's 138 - 38 = 100 people left on the train.

So, there are 100 people on the train.

25% of $40 is 0.25 x $40 = $10. 

So, the jeans are $10 off. 

Now, we need to subtract $10 from the original price of $40. 

$40 - $10 = $30. 

Mike will pay $30 for the jeans. 

Now, we need to find out how much money he will have left over if he pays with a $50 bill. 

We need to subtract the price of the jeans ($30) from the $50 bill. 

$50 - $30 = $20. 

So, Mike will have $20 left over. 

The final answer is: $20"
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first find the total number of employees after three months. 

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. 

After the first month, the total number of employees will be 200 + 20 = 220.
After the second month, the total number of employees will be 220 + 20 = 240.
After the third month, the total number of employees will be 240 + 20 = 260.

Now, we need to find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months. We can do this by multiplying the total number of employees by the salary of each employee.

Total amount = (200 + 20 + 20 + 20) * 4000
Total amount = (200 + 60) * 4000
Total amount = 260 * 4000
Total amount = 1040000

The final answer is: 1040000"
"To find the total time they will be caroling, we need to add the time it takes to sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice and the time it takes to sing ""Jingle Bells"" once.

First, let's find the total time for ""Deck the Halls"". Since they will sing it twice, we multiply the time by 2: 150 * 2 = 300 seconds.

Now, let's add the time for ""Jingle Bells"": 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.

So, the choir will be caroling for 540 seconds.

540"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Billy's starting salary is $10 per hour. After 2 months, he gets a raise of $0.50 per hour, so his new salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After another year, he gets a raise of $1.00 per hour, so his new salary is $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's starting salary, so it's $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate how much they earn in 20 hours. Billy earns $11.50 per hour, so in 20 hours, he earns $11.50 * 20 = $230. Sally earns $10.50 per hour, so in 20 hours, she earns $10.50 * 20 = $210.

To find out how much more money Billy earns than Sally, we need to subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $230 - $210 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To find out how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels, we need to first find the cost of 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels.

3 loaves of bread cost 3 x $2 = $6.
2 bagels cost 2 x $1 = $2.

Now, we need to find the difference between the cost of 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels. 

$6 (3 loaves of bread) - $2 (2 bagels) = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To find out how many points Nikita scored, we need to first find out half of Pierson's score. Half of 278 is 278 / 2 = 139. 

Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score, so Nikita scored 139 + 11 = 150 points.

To find the total points, we need to add Pierson's score and Nikita's score. Pierson scored 278 points and Nikita scored 150 points. 

278 + 150 = 428

The final answer is: 428"
"To find out how many trees the students will plant, we need to multiply the number of classes by the number of students per class. 

Number of classes: 40
Number of students per class: 25
Total students: 40 x 25 = 1000

Each student plants 1 tree, so the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Now, we need to find out how many trees the teachers will plant. Each teacher plants 2 trees, and there are 3 teachers per class. 

Number of classes: 40
Number of teachers per class: 3
Total teachers: 40 x 3 = 120

Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 x 2 = 240.

Now, we add the total number of trees planted by students and teachers to find the total number of trees planted.

Total trees planted by students: 1000
Total trees planted by teachers: 240
Total trees planted: 1000 + 240 = 1240

"To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we need to know the total number of stuffed animals she has. 

First, let's add up the number of stuffed animals she already has: 
3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. To do this, we multiply the total number of stuffed animals by 0.3 (which is the same as 30%).
0.3 * 14 = 4.2

Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we can buy 4.2 stuffed goats, but we can only buy 4 stuffed goats. 

However, if we buy 4 stuffed goats, the percentage of stuffed goats will be 4 / 18 = 0.222, which is less than 30%. So, we need to buy more stuffed goats.

Let's try buying 5 stuffed goats. The total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + 5 = 19. The percentage of stuffed goats will be 5 / 19 = 0.263, which is still less than 30%.

Let's try buying 6 stuffed goats. The total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + 6 = 20. The percentage of stuffed goats will be 6 / 20 = 0.3, which is equal to 30%.

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many hours Kris has played, we need to calculate the hours she played in 2 weeks and 1 week.

In 2 weeks, there are 14 days. If Kris plays for half an hour every day, she plays 14 x 0.5 = 7 hours in 2 weeks.

In 1 week, there are 7 days. If Kris plays for 2 hours every day, she plays 7 x 2 = 14 hours in 1 week.

So, in total, Kris has played 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours. Since she has already played 21 hours, she still needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to find out how far each car will travel in 2 hours.

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel 60 x 2 = 120 miles.

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel 70 x 2 = 140 miles.

The difference in distance between the two cars is 140 - 120 = 20 miles.

So, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much James paid, we need to add the cost of the diamond and the gold, then add a 30% premium to that total.

First, let's add the cost of the diamond and the gold: 
$600 (diamond) + $300 (gold) = $900

Next, we need to find 30% of $900. To do that, we multiply $900 by 0.30 (which is the same as 30%).
$900 * 0.30 = $270

Now, we add the 30% premium to the total cost of the diamond and gold.
$900 + $270 = $1170

So, James paid $1170 for the ring. 

The final answer is: $1170"
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to find the total number of students who passed and the total number of students. 

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade level. 
- 340 out of 500 third-graders passed, so the pass rate for third-graders is 340/500.
- 40 out of 100 fourth-graders passed, so the pass rate for fourth-graders is 40/100.
- The pass rate for fifth-graders is twice the pass rate of fourth-graders, so it's 2 * (40/100) = 80/100.

Now, let's find the total number of students who passed. 
- 340 third-graders passed, and 40 fourth-graders passed, and 80 fifth-graders passed. 
So, the total number of students who passed is 340 + 40 + 80 = 460.

Next, let's find the total number of students. 
- 500 third-graders, 100 fourth-graders, and 400 fifth-graders. 
So, the total number of students is 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000.

Now, we can find the overall pass rate by dividing the total number of students who passed by the total number of students. 
The overall pass rate is 460/1000 = 0.46 or 46%.

The final answer is: 46"
"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to know how many square inches of mosaic he can make with the glass chips he has. 

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make one square inch, and he has 72 chips in each bag, he can make 72 / 12 = 6 square inches with one bag. 

Since he has two bags, he can make 6 * 2 = 12 square inches with the glass chips. 

Since his mosaic is three inches tall, and it's a square mosaic, it will be a 3x3 square. This means it will have 3 * 3 = 9 square inches. 

Since he can make 12 square inches with the glass chips, and his mosaic is only 9 square inches, he can make a 3x3 square mosaic. 

To find out how long the mosaic will be, we need to find the square root of the number of square inches. The square root of 9 is 3. 

So, the length of the mosaic will be 3 inches.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many gallons of tea were at the beginning of the party, we need to first find out how many quarts of tea were drank in total. 

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so 4 x 1.5 = 6 quarts. 
16 students drank 2 quarts each, so 16 x 2 = 32 quarts. 
6 + 32 = 38 quarts of tea were drank in total. 

Now, we know that there are 10 quarts of tea left, and 38 quarts were drank in total. So, the total quarts of tea at the beginning of the party is 10 + 38 = 48 quarts.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts, we can convert the total quarts to gallons by dividing by 4. 

48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is: 12"
"Dale started with 100 candies. He sold 150, so he had 100 - 150 = -50 candies left. But you can't have a negative number of candies, so he must have sold more than he had. This means he must have sold all 100 candies he started with. 

Then he ordered 100 more candies. Now he has 100 candies. He needs to sell all 100 candies he has now. 

So, he needs to sell 100 candies.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students. 

- At the end of January, the number of students doubles, so there are 10 * 2 = 20 students.
- At the end of February, the number of students doubles again, so there are 20 * 2 = 40 students.
- At the end of March, the number of students doubles again, so there are 40 * 2 = 80 students.
- At the end of April, the number of students doubles again, so there are 80 * 2 = 160 students.
- At the end of May, the number of students doubles again, so there are 160 * 2 = 320 students.

Now, let's find out how many students joined by the end of May. We subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May: 320 - 10 = 310.

Felix made $105 in total during the week. Since there are 5 days in a week, we need to divide the total money he made by 5 to find out how much he made per day. 

$105 / 5 = $21 per day.

Now, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for every branch he climbs. To find out how many branches he climbed per day, we need to divide the money he made per day by the cost per branch.

$21 / $0.25 = 84 branches per day.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, Rose picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each. So, that's 3 x 5 = 15 petals.

Then, she picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each. So, that's 4 x 6 = 24 petals.

Next, she picks 5 flowers with 4 petals each. So, that's 5 x 4 = 20 petals.

Lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each. So, that's 6 x 7 = 42 petals.

Now, let's add up all the petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.

But, she drops 1 of each flower, so we need to subtract 4 petals (1 from each of the 4 different types of flowers). 101 - 4 = 97 petals.

The final answer is: 97"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores. So, together they made 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores. 

They used 18 marshmallows for the S'mores. 

They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. 

So, the total number of marshmallows used is 18 + 3 = 21. 

Now, we need to find out how many marshmallows are left in the bag. The bag originally had 35 marshmallows. 

So, the number of marshmallows left is 35 - 21 = 14.

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the number of S'mores they can make with the remaining marshmallows is 14.

Now, we need to find out how many S'mores each kid can have. There are 2 kids, so we need to divide the total number of S'mores by 2.

14 / 2 = 7.

So, each kid can have 7 S'mores.

The final answer is: 7"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter. His friends can play for half as long, so they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes with 1 quarter. The better friend can play for 1.5 times as long, so he can play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes with 1 quarter.

They play for 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. 

Jack plays for 240 minutes, so he uses 240 / 20 = 12 quarters. 

The two worse friends play for 240 minutes, so they use 240 / 10 = 24 quarters each. 

The better friend plays for 240 minutes, so he uses 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

In total, they use 12 + 24 + 24 + 8 = 68 quarters. 

Since each quarter is worth 0.25 dollars, the total money used is 68 * 0.25 = 17 dollars.

"Let's break down the information given. 

Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance. 
She uses twice as much salt as citrus zest, so she uses twice as much salt as fragrance. 
She uses twice as much oil as salt. 

Let's say the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) is x. 
Then the amount of salt is 2x. 
And the amount of oil is 2 * 2x = 4x.

The total amount of ingredients should be 10 ounces. 
So, x (zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10 ounces. 
Combine like terms: 8x = 10 ounces. 
Divide both sides by 8: x = 10/8 = 1.25 ounces. 

Since the amount of oil is 4x, the amount of oil is 4 * 1.25 = 5 ounces.

"Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars. So, Joe has 2 x 20 = 40 cars.

Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 0.2 x 40 = 8. So, Joe sold 8 cars.

He gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. He sold 8 cars, so he gives away 2 x 8 = 16 cars.

Joe sold 8 cars and gave away 16 cars. So, he gave away a total of 8 + 16 = 24 cars.

Joe had 40 cars initially. He gave away 24 cars. So, he has 40 - 24 = 16 cars left.

Now, we know that there are 20 students and they all raised the same amount. To find out how much each student raised, we need to divide the total amount raised by the number of students. 

$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250.

So, each student raised $6,250.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, Hunter counted 50 cars when he entered class. Then, 20 more cars arrived during the first break. So, the total number of cars before lunch break is 50 + 20 = 70.

When he got out of class for the lunch break, 1/2 of the cars had gone. This means 1/2 of 70 had left. To find 1/2 of 70, we need to divide 70 by 2. 

70 / 2 = 35

So, 35 cars left the parking lot. To find the number of cars that remained, we need to subtract 35 from the total number of cars before lunch break.

70 - 35 = 35

But the question asks for the total number of cars he counted during lunch break. This means we need to add the remaining cars to the number of cars that left. 

35 (remaining cars) + 35 (cars that left) = 70

Number of cycles in a day: 30
Number of tasks in each cycle: 5
Pay for each task: $1.20

First, we multiply the number of cycles by the number of tasks: 30 * 5 = 150 tasks
Then, we multiply the total tasks by the pay for each task: 150 * $1.20 = $180

Now, we need to find out how much John makes in a week. Since he works 7 days a week, we multiply his daily earnings by 7: $180 * 7 = $1260

Let's say PJ has x cards. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. 

We know that Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We also know that the total number of cards is 341. So, we can write an equation: x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341.

Combine like terms: 7x + 12 = 341.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329.

Divide both sides by 7: x = 47.

Since PJ has x cards, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has 3x cards, so Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards. Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has 3 * 47 + 12 = 147 cards.

"To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the shipping cost and the refund amount.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The book weighs 4 pounds and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound. So, the weight cost is 4 x $0.35 = $1.40. The book also needs to be shipped 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile. So, the mileage cost is 20 x $0.08 = $1.60. The total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $2.99.

Now, let's calculate the refund amount. The book cost $32, and Amazon will only refund 75% of the purchase price. So, the refund amount is 0.75 x $32 = $24.

Now, let's calculate how much Milly will lose. The shipping cost is $2.99, and the refund amount is $24. So, Milly will lose $2.99 + $24 = $26.99.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Boris produces 8,000 bars the first week. 
The second week, he produces half as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars. 
The third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find out how much he produces in total in the first three weeks, we add 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, we subtract the total produced in the first three weeks from the total for the month to find out how much he produces in the fourth week. 
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

"To find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the total time she spends on TikTok in a week and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on TikTok each week:

- She records 18 videos, each taking 4 minutes. So, the total time spent recording videos is 18 x 4 = 72 minutes.
- She spends 2 hours writing songs, which is 2 x 60 = 120 minutes.
- She spends 15 minutes each day for 6 days on makeup, so that's 15 x 6 = 90 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time she spends on TikTok each week:
72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 282 minutes to hours:
282 / 60 = 4.7 hours

Now, let's multiply the time she spends on TikTok each week by 4 to find out how much time she spends in a month:
4.7 hours/week x 4 weeks/month = 18.8 hours

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. The cost of the initial installation is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. Since the initial installation already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier, we need to subtract these from the total number of items she has. 

6 (mirrors) - 4 (initial mirrors) = 2 mirrors
2 (chandeliers) - 1 (initial chandelier) = 1 chandelier
20 (pictures) - 10 (initial pictures) = 10 pictures

The number of additional items is 2 mirrors + 1 chandelier + 10 pictures = 13 items.

The cost of the additional items is 13 items * $15.00 per item = $195.00.

The total cost is the initial installation cost + the cost of the additional items: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

Eva has saved $20.00. 
Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.
Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of $30.00, we multiply $30.00 by 0.4, which is $12.00. 
Now, we add $12.00 to $30.00 to find out how much Roy has saved, which is $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

The final answer is: $42.00"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. 
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 * 1 = 12 inches. 
Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches. 
Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we need to convert 480 inches to feet. 
480 / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total miles Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance he covered in the first 4 hours and the distance he covered in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed x Time

For the first 4 hours:
Distance = 8 miles/hour x 4 hours = 32 miles

For the next 6 hours:
Distance = 8 miles/hour x 6 hours = 48 miles

Now, we add the distances together to find the total miles Mason has traveled:
Total Distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

The final answer is: 80"
"If 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours, then 1 kangaroo can travel across the highway in 18 * 3 = 54 hours. 

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, it will take them twice as long to travel the same distance. 

So, if 1 kangaroo takes 54 hours, then 1 turtle will take 54 * 2 = 108 hours. 

Since there are 4 turtles, it will take them 108 * 4 = 432 hours to travel across the highway.

The final answer is: 432"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Kora made 20 dishes. 
Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes. 
Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 x 40 = 80 dishes. 
To find the total number of dishes they made, we add the number of dishes each person made: 20 + 40 + 80 = 140. 

The final answer is: 140"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Erika wants a laptop that costs $600. If she trades in her old laptop, the price will be reduced by $200, so the new price will be $600 - $200 = $400.

She already has some savings in her purse, let's call it x. She also got $150 from her part-time job and her mom gave her $80. So, the total amount of money she has is x + $150 + $80.

After getting the money from her job and her mom, she only needs $50 more to buy the laptop. This means that the total amount of money she has is equal to the price of the laptop minus the $50 she still needs. 

So, we can set up the equation: x + $150 + $80 = $400 - $50.

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + $230 = $350.

To find the value of x, we need to subtract $230 from both sides of the equation. 

x = $350 - $230
x = $120

So, Erika has $120 in her purse. 

The final answer is: $120"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many slices Adam gets from the large apples. Since 1 large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, 3 large apples will be sliced into 3 x 5 = 15 pieces.

Next, we need to find out how many slices Adam gets from the small apples. Since 1 small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, 5 small apples will be sliced into 5 x 3 = 15 pieces.

Now, we add the slices from the large and small apples together. 15 (from large apples) + 15 (from small apples) = 30 slices in total.

Adam eats 15 slices, so we need to subtract 15 from the total number of slices. 30 - 15 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we need to first find out how many liters of milk one cow produces in a day. 

The farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from one cow. Since he has 3 cows, the total milk produced is 5 * 3 = 15 liters. 

Now, we need to find out how many cows are needed to produce 25 liters of milk a day. We can do this by dividing 25 by 5 (the amount of milk one cow produces in a day). 

25 / 5 = 5. 

So, the farmer needs 5 cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. 

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, he needs 5 - 3 = 2 more cows. 

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to find the length of each used part and subtract it from the original length of the glue stick.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so the used part is 5/6. 
5/6 of 12 millimeters is 10 millimeters.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so the used part is 1/3. 
1/3 of 12 millimeters is 4 millimeters.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so the used part is 1/2. 
1/2 of 12 millimeters is 6 millimeters.

Now, we add the used parts together: 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks that are used is 20 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 12 - 20 = -8 millimeters. However, since we can't have a negative length, we need to recalculate the total length of the glue sticks that are not used.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so the not used part is 1/6. 
1/6 of 12 millimeters is 2 millimeters.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so the not used part is 1/3. 
1/3 of 12 millimeters is 4 millimeters.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so the not used part is 1/2. 
1/2 of 12 millimeters is 6 millimeters.

Now, we add the not used parts together: 2 + 4 + 6 = 12 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 12 millimeters.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Since Jack collected 60 dishes, and he collected twice as many dishes as socks, he must have collected 60 / 2 = 30 socks.

Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 2 * 30 = 60 socks.

Peter also has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Now, let's add up the total number of socks and dishes they have together. 
Jack has 30 socks and 60 dishes, so he has 30 + 60 = 90 items.
Peter has 60 socks and 30 dishes, so he has 60 + 30 = 90 items.
The total number of items they have together is 90 + 90 = 180.

To find the number of students good at both, we need to subtract the students who are good at math only and English only from the total number of students. 

First, let's add the students who are good at math only and English only: 5 + 8 = 13

Now, let's subtract this from the total number of students: 20 - 13 = 7

So, 7 students are good at both math and English. 

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we need to add the students who are good at math only and both math and English: 5 + 7 = 12

"To find out how many groups can perform, we need to know the total time available for performances. The concert is 2 hours long, and there's a 10-minute intermission, so the total time for performances is 2 hours - 10 minutes = 1 hour 50 minutes. 

1 hour 50 minutes is equal to 110 minutes. 

Each group takes 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage, so each group takes 10 minutes. 

Now, we need to divide the total time available for performances (110 minutes) by the time each group takes (10 minutes). 

110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups.

"To find the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest she earns each year and add it to the original amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 3/4 * $300 = $225.

So, the interest she earns in the first year is $225. 

The total amount after the first year will be $300 (original amount) + $225 (interest) = $525.

In the second year, the interest rate is still 3/4 of the new total amount, which is 3/4 * $525 = $393.75.

The interest she earns in the second year is $393.75. 

The total amount after the second year will be $525 (previous total) + $393.75 (interest) = $918.75.

In the third year, the interest rate is 3/4 of the new total amount, which is 3/4 * $918.75 = $344.31 (rounded to two decimal places).

The interest she earns in the third year is $344.31.

The total amount after the third year will be $918.75 (previous total) + $344.31 (interest) = $1263.06.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know that half of the white shirts have collars. Since there are 40 white shirts, half of them would be 40 / 2 = 20 white shirts with collars. 

So, the number of white shirts with no collars would be 40 - 20 = 20.

Next, we know that 20 of the floral shirts have buttons. Since there are 50 floral shirts, the number of floral shirts with no buttons would be 50 - 20 = 30.

Now, we need to find out how many more floral shirts with no buttons are there than white shirts with no collars. To do this, we subtract the number of white shirts with no collars from the number of floral shirts with no buttons: 30 - 20 = 10.

He sold 10 goats from Farm X, so now he has 55 - 10 = 45 goats in Farm X.

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y. So now he has 45 - 20 = 25 goats in Farm Y.

Now, we need to find the total number of goats in both farms. We add the number of goats in Farm X and Farm Y: 45 + 25 = 70.

"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to know how many pairs of shoes he buys in a year. 

Since James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, we multiply 2 pairs by 12 months to get the total pairs in a year. 

2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

Now, we know James spends $2640 on shoes each year and he buys 24 pairs of shoes in a year. To find the average cost of each pair, we divide the total cost by the number of pairs.

$2640 / 24 pairs = $110 per pair

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 x $25 = $75.

The cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 x $18 = $54.

Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, we need to subtract $2 from the cost of 3 baskets of red food. So, $54 - $6 = $48.

Now, we add the cost of 3 baskets of green food and the cost of 3 baskets of red food after the discount. $75 + $48 = $123.

"To find out how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we need to first find out how many rooms that is. 

There are 90 rooms in total, and we want to clean one-half of them. 

One-half of 90 is 90 / 2 = 45 rooms.

Now, we know it takes 20 minutes to clean each room. To find out how many minutes it would take to clean 45 rooms, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room.

45 rooms * 20 minutes per room = 900 minutes.

Since we want to know how many hours it would take, we need to convert the minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour.

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours.

So, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Let's say my age is A, my brother's age is B, and my sister's age is C. 

Since I am three years younger than my brother, A = B - 3. 
Since I am 2 years older than my sister, A = C + 2. 
Since my mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, my mom's age = 3B - 1. 

We also know that when you add all our ages, you get 87. So, A + B + C + (3B - 1) = 87. 

We can substitute A = B - 3 and A = C + 2 into the equation. 
(B - 3) + B + C + (3B - 1) = 87 
Combine like terms: 
5B + C - 4 = 87 

Now we have two equations and three variables. We can use the fact that A = C + 2 to express C in terms of A. 
C = A - 2 

Substitute C = A - 2 into the equation 5B + C - 4 = 87 
5B + (A - 2) - 4 = 87 
5B + A - 6 = 87 

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can use the fact that A = B - 3 to express A in terms of B. 
A = B - 3 

Substitute A = B - 3 into the equation 5B + A - 6 = 87 
5B + (B - 3) - 6 = 87 
6B - 9 = 87 

Add 9 to both sides: 
6B = 96 

Divide both sides by 6: 
B = 16 

Now that we know B, we can find A. 
A = B - 3 
A = 16 - 3 
A = 13 

So, I am 13 years old.

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks needed by 8 to find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs.

54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks per pack = 6.75 packs

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. 

6.75 packs → 7 packs

So, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

First, we know that the amount of water passing through the river at one point in time is 4000 gallons. 

After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so we add 6000 to 8000, which is 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

So, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons.

The final answer is: 14000"
"To find out how many people are infected after three days, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and add it to the total number of people infected.

Day 1: 
- Initially, there are 10 people infected.
- Each infected person infects 6 others, so 10 * 6 = 60 new infections.
- Total infected people = 10 (initial) + 60 (new) = 70.

Day 2: 
- The 60 people infected on Day 1 will infect 60 * 6 = 360 new people.
- The 10 people initially infected will also infect 10 * 6 = 60 new people.
- Total new infections = 360 + 60 = 420.
- Total infected people = 70 (previous) + 420 (new) = 490.

Day 3: 
- The 420 people infected on Day 2 will infect 420 * 6 = 2520 new people.
- The 70 people infected on Day 1 will infect 70 * 6 = 420 new people.
- The 10 people initially infected will infect 10 * 6 = 60 new people.
- Total new infections = 2520 + 420 + 60 = 3000.

Now, we subtract $80 from $800 to find out how much less money Julieta received than Rafaela. $800 - $80 = $720.

Julieta received $720. 

To find the total amount of money they received altogether, we add the money Rafaela received and the money Julieta received. $800 + $720 = $1520.

In a year, there are 12 months. 
Claire earns 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges in a year. 
Amber earns 1/2 badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges in a year. 
Wendy earns 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges in a year.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year, we need to subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns.

We know that together they have 85 books, so we can write an equation: x + (x + 12) + (x + 25) = 85.

Combine like terms: 3x + 37 = 85.

Subtract 37 from both sides: 3x = 48.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 16.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces he ate on the third day. First, we need to find out how many pieces were left after the first two days. 

60 - 24 = 36 pieces left after the first day.
36 - 10 = 26 pieces left after the second day.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. 7/13 of 26 is 14.

So, he ate 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces in total. 

The final answer is: 48"
"To find out how much it will cost, we need to know the price of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water. 

First, let's find the price of one bottle of soda. We know that 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00. To find the price of one bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles: $21.00 ÷ 7 = $3.00 per bottle of soda.

Next, let's find the price of one bottle of water. We know that 4 bottles of water cost $8.00. To find the price of one bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles: $8.00 ÷ 4 = $2.00 per bottle of water.

Now, we know the price of one bottle of soda is $3.00 and the price of one bottle of water is $2.00. David wants to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water. 

The cost of 3 bottles of soda is 3 x $3.00 = $9.00.
The cost of 2 bottles of water is 2 x $2.00 = $4.00.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of soda and water: $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

The final answer is: $13.00"
"To find out how much money David has left, we need to subtract the cost of the bolts from the money he has. 

First, let's find the total cost of the bolts. There are 16 bolts and each bolt costs $0.03. 

Total cost = Number of bolts * Cost per bolt
Total cost = 16 * $0.03
Total cost = $0.48

Now, let's subtract the total cost from the money David has.

Money left = Initial money - Total cost
Money left = $12.48 - $0.48
Money left = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find out how much Ella will earn after 12 hours, we need to know how much she earns per hour. We can do this by dividing the amount she earned ($33) by the number of hours she worked (3).

$33 ÷ 3 hours = $11 per hour

Now that we know Ella earns $11 per hour, we can multiply this by the number of hours she will work (12) to find out how much she will earn.

$11 per hour * 12 hours = $132

So, Ella will earn $132 after 12 hours of dog walking.

$132"
"First, we need to find out how many marbles Paul has after his friend gave him 28 marbles. We add 52 (the marbles Paul already had) and 28 (the marbles his friend gave him). 

52 + 28 = 80

Now, we need to find 1/4 of 80. To do this, we multiply 80 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing 80 by 4.

80 / 4 = 20

Paul lost 20 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has left, we subtract 20 from 80.

80 - 20 = 60

So, Paul has 60 marbles left. 

60"
"To find out how many points Amy scores, we need to calculate the points from each type of question and add them together.

First, let's find out how many points Amy gets from the multiple-choice questions. She gets 80% of 10 questions right, so she gets 0.8 x 10 = 8 questions right. Since each question is worth 1 point, she gets 8 x 1 = 8 points from the multiple-choice questions.

Next, let's find out how many points Amy gets from the true/false questions. She gets 90% of 20 questions right, so she gets 0.9 x 20 = 18 questions right. Since each question is worth 1 point, she gets 18 x 1 = 18 points from the true/false questions.

Now, let's find out how many points Amy gets from the long-answer questions. She gets 60% of 5 questions right, so she gets 0.6 x 5 = 3 questions right. Since each question is worth 5 points, she gets 3 x 5 = 15 points from the long-answer questions.

Now, we add up the points from each type of question to find the total points Amy scores: 8 + 18 + 15 = 41.

The final answer is: 41"
"To find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to know how many chickens he sold and how much money he made from selling them. 

Isaias has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them. To find 3/5 of 300, we multiply 300 by 3 and then divide by 5.

300 * 3 = 900
900 / 5 = 180

So, Isaias sold 180 chickens. 

He made a profit of $2000 by selling these chickens at $50 each. To find the total amount of money he made from selling the chickens, we multiply the number of chickens sold by the price per chicken.

180 * 50 = 9000

Since he made a profit of $2000, we need to subtract this from the total amount of money he made to find the cost price of the chickens.

9000 - 2000 = 7000

So, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"
"Let's break it down. We know that Julie sold 14 glasses of lemonade. The boys, Micah and Mitchell, sold an equal number of glasses, so together they sold 32 - 14 = 18 glasses. Since they sold an equal number, each of them sold 18 / 2 = 9 glasses. 

To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we need to subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold. So, 14 - 9 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how much Iris spent at the spa, we need to know how much she spent on her manicure and pedicure. 

She spent $400 on her hair. She spent 1/4 as much on her manicure, so we need to find 1/4 of 400. 

1/4 of 400 is 400 / 4 = 100. 

So, she spent $100 on her manicure. 

She spent 3/4 as much on her pedicure as she did on her manicure. 3/4 of 100 is 100 * 3/4 = 75.

So, she spent $75 on her pedicure.

Now, we add up the money she spent on her hair, manicure, and pedicure. 

$400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575.

The final answer is: $575"
"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to first find out how much money she will get from selling the rope. 

She has a 20-meter long rope and she sells it for $2 a meter. So, she will get 20 x $2 = $40 from selling the rope.

Now, she wants to buy a new rope that costs $1.5 a meter. Let's say the new rope is also 20 meters long. Then, the cost of the new rope will be 20 x $1.5 = $30.

Now, we need to subtract the cost of the new rope from the money she got from selling the old rope. So, $40 - $30 = $10.

So, Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope.

$10"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Melanie will be 18 years old in 10 years. This means that right now, she is 18 - 10 = 8 years old.

We need to find out when her age will be thrice her present age. Let's call the number of years it takes for her age to be thrice her present age 'x'. 

In 'x' years, Melanie's age will be 8 + x. 

In 'x' years, her age will also be thrice her present age, which is 3 * 8 = 24.

So, we can set up the equation: 8 + x = 24.

To solve for 'x', we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: x = 24 - 8.

x = 16.

So, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age in 16 years.

16"
"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's find the cost of the bacon: 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total.

Next, let's find the cost of the chicken: Each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. Since a pack of bacon costs $10 / 5 = $2, a pack of chicken costs $2 x 2 = $4. 6 packets of chicken will cost 6 x $4 = $24.

Now, let's find the cost of the strawberries: Each pack of strawberries costs $4.

Lastly, let's find the cost of the apples: Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so each pack of apples costs $4 / 2 = $2. 7 packs of apples will cost 7 x $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $24 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $72.

However, this is the total cost of all the items, and we need to subtract this from Kelly's budget to find out how much money she has left. Kelly's budget is $65, so we subtract $72 from $65.

$65 - $72 = -$7

Since we can't have a negative amount of money, this means that Kelly doesn't have enough money in her budget to buy all the items in her cart.

The final answer is: $-7"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Let's say the usual concert is x minutes long. 

Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, the final concert is 2x minutes long. 

At the end of the concert, she also performs a 15-minute encore. So, the total runtime of the final concert is 2x + 15 minutes. 

We are given that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. 

So, we can set up the equation: 2x + 15 = 65 

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. 

First, we subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 65 - 15 
2x = 50 

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 50 / 2 
x = 25 

So, her usual concerts run for 25 minutes. 

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he had.

Argo had 200 toys initially. He gave away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. 

First, let's add the number of toys he gave away: 40 + 80 + 30 = 150

Now, let's subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he had: 200 - 150 = 50

So, Argo has 50 toys now.

On Tuesday, they make 125 chimichangas.
On Wednesday, they also make 125 chimichangas.
On Friday, they make twice as many as Wednesday, so that's 2 x 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, let's add them together: 125 + 125 + 250 = 500

The final answer is: 500"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many microphones the singer was able to arrange in pairs. Let's call the number of pairs 'x'. Since each pair has 2 microphones, the total number of microphones arranged in pairs is 2x.

The singer has 50 microphones in total. 20% of the microphones won't find any space to fit in, so 80% of the microphones will be arranged in pairs. We can write this as an equation:

2x = 0.8 * 50

To find the value of x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = (0.8 * 50) / 2
x = 40

So, the singer was able to arrange 40 pairs of microphones on the stage.

"To find the total number of birds, we need to add the birds in the bushes, the birds flying overhead, and the birds feeding.

First, let's find the number of birds flying overhead. 2/3 of the birds in the bushes are flying overhead. Since there are 6 birds in the bushes, we multiply 6 by 2/3.

6 * (2/3) = 4

So, there are 4 birds flying overhead.

Next, we find the number of birds feeding. There are 3 groups of 8 birds each, so we multiply 3 by 8.

3 * 8 = 24

Now, we add the birds in the bushes, the birds flying overhead, and the birds feeding.

6 (in the bushes) + 4 (flying overhead) + 24 (feeding) = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to subtract the cookies Lani ate from the total number of cookies. 

55 (total cookies) - 5 (cookies eaten) = 50 cookies left

"To find out how many more petals the daisies have, we need to first find out how many petals the orchids have and how many petals the daisies have. 

The orchids have 5 petals each and there are 5 orchids. So, the total number of petals on the orchids is 5 x 5 = 25.

The daisies have 10 petals each and there are 4 daisies. So, the total number of petals on the daisies is 10 x 4 = 40.

Now, we need to find the difference between the total number of petals on the daisies and the total number of petals on the orchids. 

40 (daisies) - 25 (orchids) = 15

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

"To find the number of flowering plants, we need to first find the number of indoor and outdoor plants.

One-fourth of the plants are indoor plants. 
100 / 4 = 25 plants are indoor plants.

The remaining plants are 100 - 25 = 75 plants.

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. 
Two-thirds of 75 is (2/3) * 75 = 50 plants.

The rest of the remaining plants are flowering plants. 
75 - 50 = 25 plants are flowering plants.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we need to divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100.

"To find out how fast a whirligig spins, we need to know how fast a thingamabob spins. We know a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, and it spins at 121 meters per second. 

So, if a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, we can divide 121 by 11 to find out how fast a thingamabob spins. 

121 / 11 = 11 meters per second

Now, we know a whirligig spins five times the speed of a thingamabob. So, we multiply 11 by 5 to find out how fast a whirligig spins.

11 * 5 = 55 meters per second

The whirligig spins at 55 meters per second."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The salad costs $6. The yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3. 

The total cost of the salad and the yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9. 

Since Ellen pays $11 for all her goods and the salad and yogurt cost $9, the cost of two carrots is $11 - $9 = $2. 

To find the cost of one carrot, we need to divide the cost of two carrots by 2. So, $2 / 2 = $1.

"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to first find out how much he makes in a day and then multiply it by 5.

Mark used to make $10 an hour, but now he makes $10 + $2 = $12 an hour.

Since he works 8 hours a day, he makes $12 * 8 = $96 a day.

Now, we multiply the amount he makes in a day by 5 to find out how much he makes in a week: $96 * 5 = $480.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know Tasha made $80 in total from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. We also know she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as Joe's, let's say she mowed Joe's lawn x times. Then, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times. 

We know that the total amount of money she made from mowing lawns is $6. So, the total amount of money she made from mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns is $6 - $6 = $0. 

Since she made $0 from mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns, we can say that 3x + 5x = 0. 

Combine like terms: 8x = 0. 

Divide both sides by 8: x = 0. 

This doesn't make sense because it means she didn't mow Joe's lawn at all. Let's try another approach.

Let's say she mowed Joe's lawn x times and Kamala's lawn 3x times. Then, she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times. 

The total amount of money she made from mowing lawns is $6 + 3x + 5x = 8x. 

We know that the total amount of money she made from mowing lawns is $80 - (the amount she made from lemonade sales). 

So, 8x = 80 - (the amount she made from lemonade sales). 

We also know that the total amount of money she made is $80. 

So, 8x + (the amount she made from lemonade sales) = 80. 

Subtract 8x from both sides: the amount she made from lemonade sales = 80 - 8x. 

Now we have two equations: 8x = 80 - (the amount she made from lemonade sales) and 8x + (the amount she made from lemonade sales) = 80. 

Subtract the first equation from the second equation: 2 * (the amount she made from lemonade sales) = 80. 

Divide both sides by 2: the amount she made from lemonade sales = 40.

Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

"To find out how much John makes in a month, we need to multiply the number of times he rents his car by the number of hours he rents it each time, and then multiply that by his hourly rate.

He rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so that's 10 x 3 = 30 hours.

He gets paid $25 an hour, so he makes 30 x $25 = $750 in a month.

His car payment is $500, so to find out how much profit he makes, we need to subtract his car payment from the amount he makes in a month.

$750 - $500 = $250

So, John makes a profit of $250 on his car.

"To find the total distance they rowed, we need to find out how far Anis rowed and add it to Dijana's distance. 

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find 1/5 of Dijana's distance, we multiply 50 by 1/5. 

50 * 1/5 = 10

So Anis rowed 10 miles more than Dijana. To find the total distance Anis rowed, we add 10 to Dijana's distance.

Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles.

Now we add Dijana's and Anis's distance to find the total distance they rowed.

Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis's distance
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more than as many pages as Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 5 + 13 = 18 pages today.

So, Denise read 10 + 18 = 28 pages in total. 

Daniel read 13 pages yesterday and 0 pages today, so he read 13 pages in total.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to subtract the total number of pages Daniel read from the total number of pages Denise read. 

28 (Denise's total pages) - 13 (Daniel's total pages) = 15

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Calvin, his wife, and their two children are 4 people in total. They will each eat one bowl of soup for dinner. 

Since the pot can fill 4 adult's bowls, it can fill 4 bowls for dinner. 

Now, we need to find out how many bowls are left for the children. Since the pot can fill 8 child's bowls, we can say that 8 child's bowls = 4 adult's bowls. 

So, if 4 adult's bowls are eaten, 4 child's bowls will be left. 

Now, we need to find out how many times the 2 children can eat from the leftover soup. 

There are 4 child's bowls left, and there are 2 children. 

4 child's bowls / 2 children = 2. 

So, each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch 2 times from the leftover soup.

"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to calculate the total material needed for small and large masks separately and then add them together.

For small masks, Jo needs 2 yards of material to make 4 masks. To find out how much material she needs for 20 small masks, we can multiply the material needed for 4 masks by 5 (20/4 = 5). 

2 yards * 5 = 10 yards

For large masks, Jo needs 2.25 yards of material to make 3 masks. To find out how much material she needs for 8 large masks, we can multiply the material needed for 3 masks by 2.67 (8/3 = 2.67, rounded to 2.67).

2.25 yards * 2.67 = 6 yards

Now, we add the material needed for small and large masks together.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Let's say Adam's age four years ago was x. 

Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write an equation: 

Duncan's age eight years ago = 2 * Adam's age four years ago
60 - 8 = 2 * (x - 4)

Simplifying the equation: 
52 = 2x - 8

Adding 8 to both sides:

So, Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres. 

Now, we need to add the acres of both farms together. 200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700.

The final answer is: 700"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

In an 8-hour workday, he will complete 40 * 8 = 320 packages.

Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, he will earn 320 * $0.20 = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to know how long it takes him to solve the puzzles and then divide that by the time it takes him to drink a bottle of water.

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so an extreme sudoku takes 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how many 30-minute intervals are in 180 minutes. We can do this by dividing 180 by 30, which is 6.

So, John drinks 6 bottles of water while solving the extreme sudoku."
"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon. Since there are 20 red balloons, he threw 2 * 20 = 40 pieces of bologna at the red balloons.

We also know that Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna at the balloons. Since he threw 40 pieces at the red balloons, he must have thrown 58 - 40 = 18 pieces of bologna at the yellow balloons.

We know that Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. To find out how many yellow balloons there are, we can divide the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons (18) by the number of bologna pieces thrown at each yellow balloon (3). 

18 / 3 = 6

So, there are 6 yellow balloons in the bundle."
"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to find out how many miles he drives in 30 days. 

He drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so we multiply 100 miles by 30 days. 

100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Now, we need to find out how many 1000-mile intervals are in 3000 miles. We can do this by dividing 3000 miles by 1000 miles.

3000 miles / 1000 miles = 3

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Bruce works 5 hours on Tuesday. 
On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 2 x 5 = 10 hours on Wednesday. 
On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours on Thursday.

Now, let's add up the hours he works in all three days: 
5 (Tuesday) + 10 (Wednesday) + 8 (Thursday) = 23

The final answer is: 23"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. They bought a cake for $11.
2. They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. Since 2 balloons cost $0.5, we can find the cost of 1 balloon by dividing $0.5 by 2, which is $0.25. Now, we multiply 12 balloons by $0.25 to get the total cost of the balloons, which is $3.
3. The total cost of the cake and balloons is $11 + $3 = $14.
4. They bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so the total cost of the ice cream is 2 x $7 = $14.
5. The total cost of the cake, balloons, and ice cream is $14 + $14 = $28.
6. Since they used all the money to buy these items, the total amount of money they had is $28.
7. Since they had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount of money by 2 to find out how much each of them had. $28 / 2 = $14.

The final answer is: $14"
"To find out how many pieces of fruit are left, we need to know how many pieces Kira bought in total and then subtract the number of pieces Lola ate.

Kira bought 3 apples, 5 bananas, and 6 oranges. To find the total number of fruits, we add these numbers together: 3 + 5 + 6 = 14.

Lola ate 2 pieces of fruit. To find out how many are left, we subtract 2 from the total: 14 - 2 = 12.

So, there are 12 pieces of fruit left.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know there are 6 students playing tennis. Since there are twice that number playing volleyball, we multiply 6 by 2 to get the number of students playing volleyball. 

6 * 2 = 12

So, there are 12 students playing volleyball. 

Now, we add the number of students playing tennis and volleyball to get the total number of students playing those sports. 

6 + 12 = 18

Next, we know there are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer. To find the total number of students playing soccer, we add the number of boys and girls. 

16 + 22 = 38

Now, we add the total number of students playing tennis and volleyball to the total number of students playing soccer to get the overall total. 

18 + 38 = 56

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total money raised, we need to find the profit made by each student and then multiply it by the number of students.

First, let's find the profit made by each student. Each student sold 10 lollipops at $0.8 each, so the total money made by each student is 10 x $0.8 = $8.

The cost of each lollipop is $0.5, so the cost for 10 lollipops is 10 x $0.5 = $5.

The profit made by each student is the money made minus the cost, which is $8 - $5 = $3.

Now, we multiply the profit made by each student by the number of students to find the total profit. The total profit is $3 x 30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Larry has 3 cats. 
He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs. 
He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits. 
He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish. 
He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils. 

Now, let's count all of Larry's pets: 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets.

The final answer is: 47"
"Let's figure this out. Abby can eat 2 slices a day, and Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, so Josh can eat 2 x 2 = 4 slices a day.

Together, they can eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices a day.

The loaf of bread has 24 slices. To find out how many days it will last, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat per day. 

24 slices / 6 slices per day = 4 days.

The final answer is: 4"
"Martha collects one shell every month. To find out how many shells she has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to count the number of months she has been collecting shells.

Martha started collecting shells at 5 years old, and she is collecting shells until her 10th birthday. So, the number of months she has been collecting shells is the difference between her 10th birthday and her 5th birthday.

There are 12 months in a year. So, from 5 to 10 years old, Martha has been collecting shells for 5 years. 

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects one shell every month, she will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

Lana has 27 cups of tea in total. She divides them into 3 rows, so each row will have the same number of cups. To find out how many cups are in each row, we need to divide 27 by 3.

27 ÷ 3 = 9

So, each row has 9 cups. Since she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row will also be 9.

Now, let's find out how many cups of tea are left after she creates the mint and chamomile tea. She has 27 cups in total and 18 cups of mint and chamomile tea (9 cups in each row). 

27 - 18 = 9

She uses the remaining 9 cups to brew cinnamon tea. This means the remaining 9 cups are all cinnamon tea.

The number of mint tea cups in each row is 9.

"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we need to figure out how many trips he can make in 8 hours and then divide 24 berries by that number.

The sloth takes 4 hours for a round trip, so in 8 hours, he can make 8 / 4 = 2 trips.

Since he picks the same number of berries on each trip, we can divide 24 berries by 2 trips to find the least number of berries he can pick up per trip.

24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how much water is in the tank, we need to know how much water they filled it with. They filled it with half the amount of water in the pool, which is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Now, we need to find out how much water is left in the tank after 6 days. They are emptying the tank at a rate of 500 gallons per day. So, in 6 days, they will empty 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons.

To find out how much water is left, we need to subtract the amount of water emptied from the initial amount of water in the tank. So, 5000 - 3000 = 1000 gallons.

The final answer is: 1000"
"Let's break down the information given. Colby has already spent money on:

- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total money spent so far: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Colby has $150 in total to spend. He still has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

He wants to see movies and buy popcorn and candy tonight. The cost of popcorn and candy is $8 + $2 = $10. He has $20 left, so he can buy the popcorn and candy.

Now, let's find out how many more movies he can see. The cost of a movie on a Friday or Saturday is $10, and the cost of a movie on other days is $7. Since it's a Friday, the cost of a movie is $10.

Colby has $20 left, and he wants to spend it on movies. He can see 2 movies on Fridays or Saturdays with $20, but he can see 3 movies on other days with $20.

However, since it's a Friday, he can only see movies on Fridays or Saturdays. So, he can see 2 more movies.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to find the calories of each mini pastry and multiply it by the number of each type of pastry. 

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories. 

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, we multiply the calories of each mini pastry by the number of each type of pastry. 
200 mini cinnamon rolls have 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.
300 mini blueberry muffins have 150 * 300 = 45,000 calories.

Now, we add the calories of both types of pastries to get the total calories. 
40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

The final answer is: 85000"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to find the total number of Junebugs she removed and then divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, so 2 x 39 = 78 Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Tuesday, so 2 x 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's add up the total number of Junebugs removed: 
39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378

There are 5 days in total. To find the average, we divide the total by 5:
378 / 5 = 75.6

"To find out how far each vehicle traveled, we need to multiply their speed by the time they traveled.

The bus traveled 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so it went 60 x 5 = 300 miles.

The car traveled 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so it went 30 x 8 = 240 miles.

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled. 

300 miles (bus) - 240 miles (car) = 60 miles.

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's start by adding up the number of blocks, stuffed animals, and rings. 

Blocks: 31
Stuffed animals: 8
Rings: 9
Total so far: 31 + 8 + 9 = 48

Since the total number of toys after adding the bouncy balls is 62, we need to find out how many bouncy balls were added. 

To do this, we subtract the total number of toys before the bouncy balls from the total number of toys after the bouncy balls.

62 (total after bouncy balls) - 48 (total before bouncy balls) = 14

So, there are 14 bouncy balls in the tube.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Let's say John's age is x. 
Since Paul is 10 years older than John, Paul's age is x + 10. 
Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, so Peter's age is x + (x + 10) = 2x + 10. 

The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old. We know that Peter's age is 2x + 10, Paul's age is x + 10, and Jean's age is x. 

So, we can write the equation: (2x + 10) + (x + 10) + x = 100. 

Combine like terms: 4x + 20 = 100. 

Subtract 20 from both sides: 4x = 80. 

Divide both sides by 4: x = 20. 

Now that we know John's age is 20, we can find Peter's age. Peter's age is 2x + 10, so Peter's age is 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50.

Maria started with 1 water balloon. Her friends each got 2 balloons, so that's 4 friends * 2 balloons = 8 balloons. 

Now, Maria has 1 balloon and her friends have 8 balloons, so in total, they have 1 + 8 = 9 balloons. 

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. So, that's 4 friends + 1 (Maria) * 3 balloons = 15 more balloons. 

Now, we add the 15 new balloons to the 9 balloons they already had, so 9 + 15 = 24 balloons.

"To find out how many tables they need, we first need to know how many boxes of stuff they have in total. 

They have 10 people donating 5 boxes each, so that's 10 x 5 = 50 boxes. They also have 10 boxes already, so in total, they have 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

They can fit 2 boxes per table, and they already have 15 tables. To find out how many more tables they need, we need to divide the total number of boxes by the number of boxes per table. 

60 boxes / 2 boxes per table = 30 tables. 

Since they already have 15 tables, they need 30 - 15 = 15 more tables. 

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the average total distance spat, we need to find the total distance spat by each person and then divide it by the number of seeds they spat.

Zoey spits 40 seeds, each 10 feet, so the total distance spat by Zoey is 40 x 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney spits 35 seeds, each 12 feet, so the total distance spat by Sydney is 35 x 12 = 420 feet.

Now, we need to find the total distance spat by both of them. We add the total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney: 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance spat by the total number of seeds spat. The total number of seeds spat is 40 (by Zoey) + 35 (by Sydney) = 75 seeds.

So, the average total distance spat is 820 / 75 = 10.93 feet.

"To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000, we need to calculate how much money each machine makes in a month and then subtract the money made by the WidgetMaster 9000 from the money made by the Widgeteer 3000.

First, let's find out how many widgets each machine makes in a day. The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour and runs 24 hours a day, so it makes 60 x 24 = 1440 widgets a day. The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour and runs 24 hours a day, so it makes 45 x 24 = 1080 widgets a day.

Now, let's find out how many widgets each machine makes in a month. There are 30 days in a month, so the Widgeteer 3000 makes 1440 x 30 = 43200 widgets in a month, and the WidgetMaster 9000 makes 1080 x 30 = 32400 widgets in a month.

Each widget sells for $6, so the Widgeteer 3000 makes 43200 x $6 = $259200 in a month, and the WidgetMaster 9000 makes 32400 x $6 = $194400 in a month.

To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000, we subtract the money made by the WidgetMaster 9000 from the money made by the Widgeteer 3000: $259200 - $194400 = $64600.

So, the total cost of the 12-hour stay with the additional hours is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To find out how much money Cameron would save, we need to subtract the cost of the 12-hour stay with the additional hours from the cost of the 24-hour stay.

The amount of money Cameron would save is 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

"To find out how much hay Nate needs, we need to calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately, then add them together.

First, let's find out how much hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds, and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Twice the amount each goat needs is 2 x 5 = 10 pounds. 3 pounds less than that is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. So, 15 x 5 = 75 pounds.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay. So, 12 x 7 = 84 pounds.

Now, we add the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep together. 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

John spent 50 dollars on gas, so he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left.

John deposited 100 dollars in the bank, so he has 250 - 100 = 150 dollars left.

Now, let's calculate how much money John has left after buying 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each. 

5 pencils * 10 dollars = 50 dollars

John has 150 dollars left, so after buying the pencils, he has 150 - 50 = 100 dollars left.

"First, we need to find out how much James paid for the CDs. He got 10 CDs for 40% off, so he paid 60% of the original price. 

60% of $15 is 0.6 x $15 = $9. 

So, James paid $9 per CD. He bought 10 CDs, so he paid 10 x $9 = $90.

Then, he sold 5 CDs for $40 each. He sold 5 CDs, so he got 5 x $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James was out, we need to subtract the money he got from the money he paid. 

$90 (what he paid) - $200 (what he got) = -$110. 

But, since you can't be out a negative amount of money, we need to find out how much he actually lost.

"To find out how long it took James to get across the lake, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Find out how long it took James to swim 60% of the distance.
60% of 20 miles is 0.6 x 20 = 12 miles. 
Since James swims at 2 miles per hour, it took him 12 / 2 = 6 hours to swim 12 miles.

Step 2: Find out how long James rested on the island.
He rested for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Step 3: Find out how long the remaining distance is.
The remaining distance is 20 - 12 = 8 miles.

Step 4: Find out how long it took James to swim the remaining distance at half the speed.
At half the speed, James swims at 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. 
It took him 8 / 1 = 8 hours to swim the remaining 8 miles.

Step 5: Add up the time it took James to swim, rest, and swim the remaining distance.
6 hours (swimming) + 3 hours (resting) + 8 hours (swimming the remaining distance) = 17 hours.

"To find the total commission, we need to find the commission from the New York Times and the commission from the Wall Street Journal, then add them together.

First, let's find the commission from the New York Times. The commission is 10% of the cost of each copy, which is $5. So, the commission from each copy is 10% of $5, which is 0.1 x $5 = $0.50. 

Since Cayley sold 6 copies of the New York Times, the total commission from the New York Times is 6 x $0.50 = $3.

Next, let's find the commission from the Wall Street Journal. The commission is 8% of the cost of each copy, which is $15. So, the commission from each copy is 8% of $15, which is 0.08 x $15 = $1.20.

Since Cayley sold 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal, the total commission from the Wall Street Journal is 10 x $1.20 = $12.

Let's say Azibo scored x points. 
Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, Bahati scored x + 20 points. 
Dinar scored 10 points less than Bahati, so Dinar scored (x + 20) - 10 = x + 10 points. 

The total points scored by the team is 45. So, we can write the equation: x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45. 

Combine like terms: 3x + 30 = 45. 

Subtract 30 from both sides: 3x = 15. 

Divide both sides by 3: x = 5.

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of pages in the book, we need to find out how many pages are in 1.5 inches. 

Since there are 100 pages per inch, we multiply 1.5 by 100 to find the number of pages in 1.5 inches.

1.5 * 100 = 150

So, the book has 150 pages. 

The final answer is: 150"
"To find out how many reports Vince stapled, we need to know how many hours he stapled reports. He stapled from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is 15 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 15 hours by 60 minutes to get the total minutes he stapled: 15 * 60 = 900 minutes.

Now, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many sets of 15 minutes are in 900 minutes, we divide 900 by 15: 900 / 15 = 60.

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, and there are 60 sets of 15 minutes, we multiply 30 by 60 to get the total number of reports he stapled: 30 * 60 = 1800.

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to find out the total time she slept and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. So, she sleeps for 8 hours. 

8 hours is equal to 8 x 60 = 480 minutes.

She woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. 

She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. We need to find the time she went to sleep. Since she woke up at 5:55 a.m., we can subtract the time she was sleepwalking from her wake-up time to find the time she went to sleep. 

5:55 a.m. - 2:38 a.m. = 3:17 a.m.

So, she went to sleep at 3:17 a.m.

Now, we need to find the time she went to sleep the previous night. Since she usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m., we can subtract the time she went to sleep that day from her usual bedtime to find the time she went to sleep the previous night.

10 p.m. - 3:17 a.m. = 6 hours 17 minutes

6 hours 17 minutes is equal to 6 x 60 + 17 = 383 minutes.

Now, we can find the total time she slept that day by adding the time she slept the previous night and the time she slept that night.

Total time = 383 minutes + 480 minutes = 863 minutes

Now, we can subtract the time she was sleepwalking from the total time to find the time she slept on her bed.

Time slept on bed = 863 minutes - 23 minutes (2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes)

Time slept on bed = 863 minutes - 23 minutes = 840 minutes

The final answer is: 840"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Jonathan has two dozen cups, which is 2 x 12 = 24 cups. 

Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, he has 2/3 x 24 = 16 spoons.

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so he has 16 - 6 = 10 spoons left.

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 24 cups + 10 spoons = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the number of occupied beds, we need to multiply the total capacity by 1/5. 

Total capacity = 1000 beds
Occupied beds = 1000 * 1/5 = 200 beds

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we need to find out how many patients are admitted in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 14 days.

Patients admitted in 2 weeks = 50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients

Now, we need to add the initial occupied beds to the patients admitted in 2 weeks to find the total occupied beds.

Total occupied beds = 200 + 700 = 900 beds

To find the unoccupied beds, we subtract the total occupied beds from the total capacity.

Unoccupied beds = Total capacity - Total occupied beds
= 1000 - 900
= 100 beds

The final answer is: 100"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Robyn sends 16 emails a day. 7 are work emails. 

So, the remainder of emails are 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the remainder are to her family. Two-thirds of 9 is 6.

"Let's say the real number of people who attended the concert is x. 

Since Kelly said Courtney overstated the number by 20%, that means Courtney's number (48) is 20% more than the real number (x). 

We can write this as an equation: 48 = x + 20% of x.

To find 20% of x, we multiply x by 0.2 (since 20% is the same as 0.2). 

So, the equation becomes: 48 = x + 0.2x.

Combine like terms: 48 = 1.2x.

Now, divide both sides by 1.2 to solve for x: x = 48 / 1.2.

x = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

Since Jason carried 2 balls, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, that means Jeffrey carried half of what Jason carried. So, Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, that means Jordan carried 2 x 2 = 4 balls.

Now, we know that the total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them. So, the total number of balls carried by the three boys is 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

Since the three boys picked up and carried all of the balls in one trip, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is equal to the total number of balls carried by the three boys, which is 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

The pirates dug 10 holes the first day. 

On the second day, they dug 13 holes. So, the total number of holes after the second day is 10 + 13 = 23 holes.

On the third day, they dug 8 holes and filled in 2. So, the total number of holes after the third day is 23 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes.

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, there were 4 * 10 = 40 holes at the end of the fourth day.

We already know that there were 29 holes at the end of the third day. So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 40 - 29 = 11 holes.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's say the number of corn chips that Amora and Lainey got is x. Since Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others, Collins got x + 15 corn chips.

We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, so x = 70.

Now, we can find the number of corn chips Collins got: x + 15 = 70 + 15 = 85.

The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips that Amora, Lainey, and Collins got: x + x + (x + 15) = 70 + 70 + 85 = 225.

The final answer is: 225"
"To find out how much the travel cost, we need to know that it's 50% more than the supplies. 

50% more than the supplies means we need to add 50% of the supplies to the supplies. 

50% of $400 is 0.5 x 400 = $200. 

So, the travel cost is $400 + $200 = $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Adelwolfe has caught x number of Pokémon. 

Since Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe, Stan has caught 4x - 13 Pokémon.

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so Alex has caught (4x - 13) + 5 = 4x - 8 Pokémon.

We know that together they have caught 339 Pokémon. So, we can write an equation:

x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 8) = 339

Combine like terms:

9x - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:

9x = 360

Divide by 9:

x = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokémon, we can find out how many Stan has caught:

Stan has caught 4x - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 Pokémon.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know each episode is 20 minutes long. 

Next, we know there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. So, if there are 20 minutes per episode, then there are 20 / 2 = 10 episodes.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show if he watches every episode. To do this, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode. 

10 episodes * 20 minutes per episode = 200 minutes.

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to find the total distance the bird traveled in the southerly direction and then add it to the distance the bird traveled in the northerly direction.

First, let's find the distance the bird traveled in the southerly direction. The bird flew for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour. 

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour x 10 hours
Distance = 300 miles

Then, the bird flew for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour in the northerly direction. 

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 18 miles/hour x 2 hours
Distance = 36 miles

Since the bird flew north, this distance is subtracted from the total southerly distance.

Total southerly distance = 300 miles - 36 miles
Total southerly distance = 264 miles

Next, the bird flew for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour in the southerly direction.

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 22 miles/hour x 5 hours
Distance = 110 miles

Now, we add this distance to the total southerly distance.

Total distance = 264 miles + 110 miles
Total distance = 374 miles

The final answer is: 374"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself. 1 dozen is equal to 12. So, she made 12 brownies.

At her office, they sent her home with 1/2 a dozen brownies. 1/2 a dozen is equal to 6. So, she got 6 brownies from her office.

When she arrived home, her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting. 4 dozen is equal to 48. So, she got 48 brownies from her friends.

Now, let's add up all the brownies she got: 12 (from herself) + 6 (from her office) + 48 (from her friends) = 66 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. 1 1/2 dozen is equal to 18. So, 18 brownies were eaten.

Now, let's subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies: 66 - 18 = 48.

So, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day.

The length of the fence is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet. Since it's a rectangular fence, we need to find the perimeter. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2.

Total slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total slats needed = 50 * 2
Total slats needed = 100

"Let's break this down step by step. 

Emil is 19 years old now. When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. This means that when Emil is 24, his dad's age will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.

Since Emil is 19 now, the difference between his age and his dad's age when he is 24 is 24 - 19 = 5 years. This means that his dad is currently 48 - 5 = 43 years old.

When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. This means that his brother's age when Emil is 24 will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

Since Emil is 19 now, the difference between his age and his brother's age when he is 24 is 24 - 19 = 5 years. This means that his brother is currently 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, so 3 * 4 = 12 pounds. 
On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, so 12 / 2 = 6 pounds. 

Now, we add up the pounds of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to find out how many inches she has in total. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we multiply 111 feet by 12 inches.

111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Now, we need to find out how many inches Pat needs to leave between each plant. We know she needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant, so we multiply 1.5 feet by 12 inches/foot.

1.5 feet * 12 inches/foot = 18 inches

Now, we need to find out how many inches Pat has left for the plants after leaving space between them. We subtract the total inches between the plants from the total inches in the flower bed.

1332 inches - (18 inches * number of plants) = 1332 inches - (18 inches * number of plants)

We don't know the number of plants yet, but we know Pat already owns 17 flowers. Let's call the number of plants she buys x. The total number of plants will be 17 + x.

We need to find the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed. We know that the total inches between the plants is 18 * (17 + x). We also know that the total inches between the plants and the plants themselves must be less than or equal to the total inches in the flower bed.

1332 inches - (18 inches * (17 + x)) >= 0

Now, we need to solve for x. 

1332 - 306 - 18x >= 0
1026 - 18x >= 0
-18x >= -1026
x <= 57.0

Since x must be a whole number (you can't buy a fraction of a plant), the maximum number of plants Pat can buy is 57. However, we need to find the total number of plants, which is 17 + x. 

17 + 57 = 74

First, let's find out how long it takes her to peel and cook 1 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, it will take her 1/6 of a minute to peel 1 shrimp. 

To saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, it means she can saute 3 shrimp in 1 minute. 

Now, let's add the time it takes to peel and saute 1 shrimp. It takes her 1/6 of a minute to peel 1 shrimp and 1/3 of a minute to saute 1 shrimp. So, the total time to peel and cook 1 shrimp is 1/6 + 1/3 of a minute. 

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 6. So, we convert 1/3 to 2/6. Now, we can add them: 1/6 + 2/6 = 3/6. 

3/6 can be simplified to 1/2. So, it takes her 1/2 of a minute to peel and cook 1 shrimp. 

Now, let's find out how long it takes her to peel and cook 90 shrimp. Since it takes her 1/2 of a minute to peel and cook 1 shrimp, it will take her 90 * 1/2 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp. 

90 * 1/2 is 45. 

The final answer is: 45"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. The room warms up 2 degrees an hour when the air conditioner is off.

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, so it cooled the room by 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, so it cooled the room by 3 * 4 = 12 degrees.

After that, it was turned off for 2 hours, so the room warmed up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

So, the total change in temperature is 6 - 12 + 4 = -2 degrees.

The final temperature is 2 degrees lower than the starting temperature."
"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know that Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. 

Then, Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. This means Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

Now, we need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can assume that the time between the two sightings is 75 years. 

So, the age difference between the two sightings is 75 years. 

If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, then we can subtract 75 from 90 to find his age when he saw the comet for the first time. 

90 - 75 = 15

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break it down. Buford writes a check once per month for the electric bill, so that's 12 checks per year. He also writes a check once per month for the gas bill, so that's 12 checks per year. He writes a check twice per month to the church, so that's 2 * 12 = 24 checks per year. And he writes a check quarterly to the pest and lawn service, so that's 4 checks per year (since there are 4 quarters in a year).

Now, let's add up all the checks: 12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52 checks per year.

The final answer is: 52"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split between France and Germany. This means the plane goes to Greece for 3/4 of its flights and to France and Germany for 1/4 of its flights combined. 

Since the plane goes to France and Germany for 1/4 of its flights, it goes to France for 1/4 / 2 = 1/8 of its flights. 

The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. This means the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

Now, we know the first plane makes 88 trips in total. It goes to Greece for 3/4 of its flights, which is 3/4 * 88 = 66 trips. 

The remaining trips are split between France and Germany, which is 88 - 66 = 22 trips. Since the plane goes to France for 1/8 of its flights, it goes to France for 1/8 * 88 = 11 trips.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 x 20 = 40 seconds. 
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds. 

Now, let's add up the total time: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds. 

To convert seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute). 
120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Adam's mother gave him $6. 
His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 x $6 = $12. 
So, in total, Adam got $6 + $12 = $18 from his parents. 
He bought the trousers for $30, so he had to contribute $30 - $18 = $12 from his savings.

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know that the total age of the children is 20. We also know that Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. 

So, the total age of Akbar and Alessandro is 3 + 4 = 7. 

Now, we subtract the total age of Akbar and Alessandro from the total age of all children to find the total age of Helene and Wilfred. 
20 - 7 = 13.

We are also given that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Let's denote the average age of the group as 'x'. Then, Helene's age is 2x.

The total age of the group is the sum of the ages of all children, which is 3 + 4 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age. We already know that the total age of the group is 20. 

So, we can write the equation: 3 + 4 + 2x + Wilfred's age = 20.

We also know that the total age of Helene and Wilfred is 13. So, we can write another equation: 2x + Wilfred's age = 13.

Now, we can solve the second equation for Wilfred's age: Wilfred's age = 13 - 2x.

Now, we can substitute this expression for Wilfred's age into the first equation: 3 + 4 + 2x + (13 - 2x) = 20.

Combine like terms: 7 + 2x + 13 - 2x = 20.

The 2x and -2x cancel each other out: 20 = 20.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from a fund he set up online. So, the total amount he has collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

His lawyer is going to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. The ""everyone else"" here refers to Walter's neighbors and the online fund, which is $2000. 

So, the lawyer is going to donate 3 * $2000 = $6000.

The friend gives Walter $200, but this doesn't affect the lawyer's donation.

The final answer is: $6000"
"First, we need to find out how many cookies were given to the church. There were 100 guests and each guest brought 15 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is 100 x 15 = 1500 cookies.

The bride gave 1/2 of the cookies to the church. To find 1/2 of 1500, we need to divide 1500 by 2. 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies.

Now, we know that each person in the church got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church, we need to divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got. 750 / 15 = 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's say the size of a kid's slice is x. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as a kid's slice, an adult's slice is 2x.

There are 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices is 2 + 4 = 6.

The total size of the slices for the kids is 4x (since there are 4 kids and each kid gets x size slice) and the total size of the slices for the adults is 2 * 2x = 4x (since there are 2 adults and each adult gets 2x size slice).

The total size of the watermelon is the sum of the size of the slices for the kids and the adults, which is 4x + 4x = 8x.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to divide the total size of the slices for the adults by the total size of the watermelon and multiply by 100.

So, (4x / 8x) * 100 = 50%

Each adult gets 50% of the watermelon.

"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on rounds and appointments.

First, let's calculate the time spent on rounds. He has 9 inpatients and each round takes 20 minutes. So, the total time spent on rounds is 9 * 20 = 180 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60. 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on appointments. He has 10 appointments and each appointment takes 30 minutes. So, the total time spent on appointments is 10 * 30 = 300 minutes.

Again, we can convert 300 minutes to hours by dividing by 60. 300 / 60 = 5 hours.

Now, we add the time spent on rounds and appointments to find the total time spent. 3 hours (rounds) + 5 hours (appointments) = 8 hours.

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic, so we subtract the total time spent from the total hours to find the time left for updating records. 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

"To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up all the time it takes to make the cake. 

First, we add the time it takes to make the cake batter (20 minutes) and bake the cake (30 minutes). 20 + 30 = 50 minutes.

Next, we add the time it takes to cool the cake (2 hours). Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 2 hours is 2 x 60 = 120 minutes. Now we add 120 minutes to 50 minutes. 50 + 120 = 170 minutes.

Then, we add the time it takes to frost the cake (10 minutes). 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60. 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

Now we know it takes 3 hours to make the cake. If Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we need to subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm to find the latest time she can start making the cake.

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm.

"Let's say there are x chocolate bars in a box. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. 
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars. 

Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars. 

We know they sold 64 chocolate bars together, so 8x = 64. 

To find x, we need to divide both sides by 8. 
x = 64 / 8 
x = 8

"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of the students per session, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

The studio is rented 3 days a week, so that's 3 sessions per week. There are 4 weeks in a month, so the total number of sessions in a month is 3 sessions/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.

The cost to rent the studio per session is $25. So, the total cost to rent the studio per month is $25/session * 12 sessions/month = $300.

The cost per student per session is $1.50. There are 10 students, so the total cost per session for the students is $1.50/student * 10 students = $15.

The total cost per session is the cost to rent the studio plus the cost for the students, which is $25 + $15 = $40.

To find the total earnings per month, we multiply the total cost per session by the number of sessions in a month: $40/session * 12 sessions/month = $480.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $480."
"Let's start by finding out how many chocolate bars are in each box for Peter and Martha.

Since Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, and he has a total of 64 chocolate bars, we can divide 64 by 4 to find out how many chocolate bars are in each box. 

64 ÷ 4 = 16

So, Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.

Now, let's do the same for Martha. Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, and she has a total of 56 chocolate bars. We can divide 56 by 7 to find out how many chocolate bars are in each box.

56 ÷ 7 = 8

So, Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

Now, we need to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha. We can do this by subtracting the number of chocolate bars Martha has in each box from the number of chocolate bars Peter has in each box.

16 - 8 = 8

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

Now, we add the number of babies born in a year to the total population. 

50 (initial population) + 30 (female porcupines) + 48 (babies born in a year) = 128

But we also need to add the babies born to the initial population, not just the female porcupines. Since each female porcupine has 4 babies, and there are 30 female porcupines, the total number of babies born in a year is 30 * 4 = 120.

So, the correct total number of porcupines after a year is: 
50 (initial population) + 120 (babies born in a year) = 170

The final answer is: 170"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9, we do that next.

Volume * 5.9 = 1400 * 5.9
Volume * 5.9 = 8260 cubic feet

Since we need to find the cost, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. There are 7.48 gallons in a cubic foot, so we multiply the volume by 7.48.

8260 * 7.48 = 61728 gallons

Now, we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon to find the total cost.

61728 * 0.10 = 6172.80

The final answer is: $6172.80"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know there are 9 red sticks. Then, there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, so the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

Next, the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we have the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks. To find the total number of sticks, we add them together: 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how many miles Matteo traveled, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled. 

Matteo's distance = 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles

To find out how many miles Shandy traveled, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled.

Shandy's distance = 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, we need to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo. We do this by subtracting Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance.

Difference in distance = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance
= 450 miles - 220 miles
= 230 miles

The final answer is: 230"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Total students: 3000
- Half of the students are over 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500
- One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male: 1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16 years old
- The remaining students are under 16 years old: 3000 - 1500 = 1500
- Half of the students under 16 years old are male: 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16 years old

Now, let's find the number of female students over 16 years old: 1500 - 375 = 1125 female students over 16 years old
And the number of female students under 16 years old: 1500 - 750 = 750 female students under 16 years old

To find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16 years old: 1125 + 750 = 1875

The final answer is: 1875"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour. 
Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps in one hour. 
Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps in one hour. 
Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps in one hour.

Now, let's find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. 
Bethany can run 10 laps and Quinn can run 5 laps, so Bethany can run 10 - 5 = 5 more laps compared to Quinn.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break it down step by step.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. 

Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

So, on the first day, the total amount of water in the tank is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

So, on the second day, the total amount of water in the tank is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water in the tank after two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the remaining amount of water needed to fill the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

Let's say the initial charge of the power bank was x%. 

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining will be x - (9 * 5) = x - 45%.

Now, for the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining will be (x - 45) - (7 * 3) = x - 45 - 21 = x - 66%.

We are given that the charge remaining at the end is 28%. So, we can set up the equation:

x - 66 = 28

To solve for x, we add 66 to both sides of the equation:

x = 28 + 66
x = 94

So, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%.

The final answer is: 94"
"To find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment, we need to calculate 20% of $10,000. 

20% of $10,000 is 0.2 x $10,000 = $2,000.

Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, so her total hourly wage is $10 + $15 = $25.

If she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings will be $25 x 40 = $1,000.

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2,000, we need to divide $2,000 by her weekly earnings.

$2,000 ÷ $1,000 = 2

So, Janet will need to work 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"Let's first find out how much money Jamaar has spent so far. 

3 peaches cost 3 x $.5 = $1.5
4 pears cost 4 x $.5 = $2
2 kiwis cost 2 x $1 = $2
5 apples cost 5 x $.75 = $3.75

Total money spent so far is $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Plums cost $.25 each. To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to divide the money he has left by the cost of one plum.

$0.75 ÷ $.25 = 3

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums."
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each friend received, we need to first find out how many packs Anne gave to her friends. 

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs to her friends.

Since she gave the packs equally to 10 friends, we need to divide the number of packs by 10. 

13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs per friend. 

Since each pack has 60 pieces, we multiply the number of packs each friend received by 60.

1.3 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 78 pieces.

So, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

78"
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 x $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 x $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 x $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"Let's break this down step by step. Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums. To find out how many pictures are in each album, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums.

72 pictures / 8 albums = 9 pictures per album

Now, we know that 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits. Since the number of pictures in each album is the same, we can multiply the number of albums by the number of pictures per album to find the total number of selfies and portraits.

Selfies: 3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27 selfies
Portraits: 2 albums * 9 pictures per album = 18 portraits

The total number of portraits and selfies is 27 + 18 = 45."
"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to know how many pages he reads per minute. 

James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. To find out how many pages he reads per minute, we divide the number of pages by the number of minutes. 

3 pages / 10 minutes = 0.3 pages per minute.

Now, we know James reads 18 pages. To find out how many minutes it takes him to read 18 pages, we divide the number of pages by the number of pages he reads per minute.

18 pages / 0.3 pages per minute = 60 minutes.

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

There were 100 guests initially. 24 guests checked out early, so we subtract 24 from 100. 
100 - 24 = 76

15 guests checked out late, but we don't subtract them yet because we don't know how many are left. 

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. So, 2 * 15 = 30 people checked in. 
Now we add 30 to the remaining guests. 
76 + 30 = 106

7 more people checked in after dinner. We add 7 to the total. 
106 + 7 = 113

So, the hotel now has 113 guests.

"First, let's find out how many easy, average, and difficult questions there are. 

40% of 60 questions are easy. To find 40% of 60, we multiply 60 by 0.4. 
60 * 0.4 = 24 easy questions.

Since the rest of the questions are equally divided as average and difficult, we divide the remaining questions by 2. 
60 - 24 = 36 questions left. 
36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Now, let's find out how many questions Aries is sure to get right. 

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions. To find 75% of 24, we multiply 24 by 0.75. 
24 * 0.75 = 18 easy questions.

Aries is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions. To find half of 18, we divide 18 by 2. 
18 / 2 = 9 average and difficult questions.

Now, let's add up the questions Aries is sure to get right. 
18 (easy) + 9 (average) + 9 (difficult) = 36 questions.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

Let's say the number of large stuffed animals sold is L and the number of small stuffed animals sold is S. We know that S = 2L (since she sold twice as many small ones as large ones).

We also know that the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small one. Since each small stuffed animal costs $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total amount earned from the sales is $120. This is the sum of the earnings from the large stuffed animals and the small stuffed animals. The earnings from the large stuffed animals is $12L and the earnings from the small stuffed animals is $4S.

So, we can write the equation: 12L + 4S = 120.

We also know that S = 2L. We can substitute this into the equation: 12L + 4(2L) = 120.

This simplifies to 12L + 8L = 120, which is 20L = 120.

To find L, we divide both sides by 20: L = 120 / 20 = 6.

Since S = 2L, S = 2 * 6 = 12.

So, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to first find out how many sandwiches they eat in one day. 

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, the wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and the son eats 2 sandwiches per day. 

So, the total number of sandwiches they eat in one day is 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of sandwiches they eat in one day by 7 to find out how many sandwiches they eat in one week.

11 sandwiches/day * 7 days = 77 sandwiches

The final answer is: 77"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, Suzanne sold 80 cookies for $1 each. So, she made 80 x $1 = $80 from selling cookies.

Then, she sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each. So, she made 60 x $4 = $240 from selling cupcakes.

Now, let's add the money she made from selling cookies and cupcakes. $80 + $240 = $320.

But, she gave her two sisters $10 each. So, she gave away a total of 2 x $10 = $20.

Now, let's subtract the money she gave away from her total earnings. $320 - $20 = $300.

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings.

The Smith twins found 30 eggs each, so together they found 30 x 2 = 60 eggs.

There are 100 eggs in total, and the Smith twins found 60. That means 100 - 60 = 40 eggs are left.

But we know that all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. So, the friends found 40 - 10 = 30 eggs.

The friends found 30 eggs."
"To find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe, we need to know how much he can mine with an iron pickaxe first. Since he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe than with his bare hands, he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe.

Now, we need to find out how much he can mine with a steel pickaxe. He can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe. 50% of 24 pounds is 24 * 0.5 = 12 pounds. So, he can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, we know that one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe. To find out how much 40 dwarves can mine in a day, we multiply 36 by 40. 36 * 40 = 1440 pounds of ore per day.

Since there are 30 days in a month, we multiply 1440 by 30 to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month. 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds of ore.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to figure out the price per sandwich for the first two packages. 

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.5 per sandwich. 

The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.5 per sandwich. 

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages, which is $1.5. 

Now, we multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches in the third package: $1.5 * 8 = $12.

The price of the package with 8 sandwiches is $12."
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to subtract the money he got from selling his old bedroom from the price of the new bedroom set. 

First, we subtract $1000 from $3000. 

$3000 - $1000 = $2000

This means Tom still owes $2000 for the bedroom set. 

Since he has to pay 10% of the remaining amount each month, we need to find 10% of $2000. 

10% of a number is the same as 0.1 times the number.

"To find out how many balloons Sally had left, we need to calculate the number of balloons that burst, the number of yellow balloons she released, and the number of blue balloons she added.

First, let's find out how many red balloons burst. 40% of 25 red balloons burst, so we multiply 25 by 0.4. 25 * 0.4 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst.

Now, we have 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. She had 12 yellow balloons, so half of that is 12 / 2 = 6. So, 6 yellow balloons were released.

Now, we have 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.

Then, Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree. She added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons. 75% of 8 is 8 * 0.75 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

Now, we have 15 red balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons. To find the total number of balloons, we add them together: 15 + 6 + 6 = 27.

"To find the chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the chance that he won't get an extension. 

There's a 50% chance the substitute teacher won't collect the homework. If the normal teacher comes in, there's a 60% chance she won't give an extension (100% - 40%). If the normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension, there's a 80% chance Marcus won't get a personal extension (100% - 20%). 

So, the chance that Marcus won't get an extension is 50% + (50% * 60%) + (50% * 60% * 80%). 

First, we calculate 50% * 60% = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3. 
Then, we calculate 50% * 60% * 80% = 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.24. 
Now, we add 50% (0.5) + 0.3 + 0.24 = 0.74. 

To convert 0.74 to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.74 * 100 = 74%.

Melissa works for 6 hours a day for 3 days, so she works a total of 6 * 3 = 18 hours. 

She is paid $15 per day, so she makes a total of 15 * 3 = $45. 

Her parking expenses are $3 per day, so her total expenses are 3 * 3 = $9. 

Now, we subtract her expenses from her total pay: 45 - 9 = $36.

"To find out how many seconds it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to know how many bottles of soda he will place on the driveway. 

Since the driveway is 24 feet wide and he puts a bottle every 3 feet, we can divide 24 by 3 to find out how many bottles he will place. 

24 / 3 = 8

So, Richard will place 8 bottles of soda on the driveway. 

It will take him 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, dropping the candy in. Since he has to do this 8 times, we multiply 5 seconds by 8.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, Jim gets $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years. So, the total amount of loans he gets is 50,000 * 4 = 200,000 dollars.

He also lost money by not working for 4 years. He had a 25,000 a year job, so the total amount of money he lost is 25,000 * 4 = 100,000 dollars.

So, the total amount of money he needs to earn is 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000 dollars.

After college, his income triples, so he now makes 3 * 25,000 = 75,000 dollars per year.

To find out how long it will take him to earn 300,000 dollars, we can divide the total amount by his new income: 300,000 / 75,000 = 4 years.

"To find out how much fabric Jim needs, we need to find the area of the two pieces of fabric. 

First, we need to find the dimensions of the fabric. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. We need to add 2 feet to both the length and the width. 

New length = 6 + 2 = 8 feet
New width = 8 + 2 = 10 feet

Now, we need to find the area of one piece of fabric. 

Area = length * width
Area = 8 * 10
Area = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we need to multiply the area by 2.

Total area = 2 * 80
Total area = 160 square feet

"To find out how many letters the post office delivered on Tuesday, we need to find one-fifth of the letters delivered on Monday and then add 17 to it. 

One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, the post office delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters on Tuesday.

To find out how many letters the post office delivered on Wednesday, we need to find twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday and then add 5 to it. 

Twice as many as 102 is 102 * 2 = 204. 
So, the post office delivered 204 + 5 = 209 letters on Wednesday.

Now, we need to add the number of letters delivered on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday to find the total number of letters delivered.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, Johnny's dad lost $5 in the first race. 

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, he lost $5 in the first race. Twice that is 2 x $5 = $10. $1 more than that is $10 + $1 = $11. So, he won $11 in the second race.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he won $11 in the second race. 1.5 times that is 1.5 x $11 = $16.5. So, he lost $16.5 in the third race.

Now, let's add up all the money he lost and won. He lost $5 in the first race, won $11 in the second, and lost $16.5 in the third. So, the total money he lost is $5 + $16.5 = $21.5. 

The total money he won is $11. 

To find the average, we need to add the total money he lost and the total money he won, then divide by the number of races. The total money he lost and won is $21.5 (lost) + $11 (won) = $32.5. There were 3 races. 

$32.5 / 3 = $10.8333. 

The final answer is: $10.83"
"To find the total population of South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then multiply that by the number of people in each city.

There are 26 countries in South America. 
Each country has 5 cities. 
Each city has 1000 people.

First, we multiply the number of cities by the number of people in each city: 5 cities * 1000 people = 5000 people per country.

Then, we multiply the number of people per country by the number of countries: 5000 people per country * 26 countries = 130,000 people.

The final answer is: 130,000"
"To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now, we need to first find their current heights. 

Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, Xavier's height in inches is 4 x 12 = 48 inches. Then, we add the 3 inches he grew, so Xavier's current height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches. So, Cole's current height is 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height. To do this, we subtract Xavier's height from Cole's height: 52 - 51 = 1.

The final answer is: 1"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Let's say the first person took x dollars. 
The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person took x + 80 dollars. 
The third person took twice what the second took, so the third person took 2(x + 80) dollars.

We know that the total amount is $1920, so we can set up an equation: 
x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms: 
x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920
Combine x terms: 
4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides: 
4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4: 
x = 420

The first person took $420. 

420"
"To find out how many hours each painter worked, we need to first find out how many hours they worked in total. 

There are 7 days in a week, and they worked for 3 weeks, so they worked for 3 x 7 = 21 days.

Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to find out how many hours that is. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8ths of a day is (3/8) x 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the number of days they worked (21) by the number of hours they worked each day (9) to get the total hours they worked: 21 x 9 = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we need to divide the total hours by 4 to find out how many hours each painter worked: 189 / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

Let's say the number of balls Rory retrieved in the second set is x. 

In the first set, he retrieved 4 more balls than in the second set, so the number of balls in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls in the third set is x / 2.

We know that the total number of balls he retrieved is 19. So, we can write an equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying the whole equation by 2:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Now, let's simplify the equation:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

In 2008, the price of the car will be 20000 - (21% of 20000) = 20000 - 4200 = 15800.

In 2009, the price of the car will be 15800 - (21% of 15800) = 15800 - 3328 = 12472.

In 2010, the price of the car will be 12472 - (21% of 12472) = 12472 - 2621.32 = 9840.68.

The price of the car in 2010 is $9840.68."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that half of the books are written in English. So, half of 50 is 50 / 2 = 25 books written in English.

Next, we know that 10% of the books are written in German. To find 10% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.1 (since 10% is the same as 0.1). So, 50 * 0.1 = 5 books written in German.

Now, we know that the total number of books is 50, and 25 are in English and 5 are in German. To find the number of books written in Spanish, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total. 

50 (total books) - 25 (English books) - 5 (German books) = 20 books written in Spanish.

"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she already drove from the total distance. 

First, let's find out how many kilometers Bernice drives per day. 
325 kilometers / 4 days = 81.25 kilometers per day

Now, let's multiply the kilometers per day by the number of days to find the total distance she drove. 
81.25 kilometers/day * 4 days = 325 kilometers

Now, let's subtract the distance she drove from the total distance. 
1955 kilometers - 325 kilometers = 1630 kilometers

"To find out how many gallons Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first find out how many cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. So, in 30 days, she will drink 8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups.

Now, we need to convert cups to gallons. There are 16 cups in a gallon. So, to find out how many gallons, we divide the total cups by 16.

240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons.

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Romeo boards the train with 120 people.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the total number of people on the train becomes 120 + 20 = 140.
3. At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train. So, the number of people left on the train is 140 - 50 = 90.
   Then, twice the number of people who descended board the train, which is 2 * 50 = 100. So, the total number of people on the train becomes 90 + 100 = 190.
4. At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the number of people left on the train is 190 - 80 = 110.

"To find out how much Alison spent, we need to add up the cost of all the items she bought.

First, let's find the cost of the running shorts. The tank top cost $10, and the shorts cost $5 more than that, so the shorts cost $10 + $5 = $15.

The tennis shoes were originally $48, but they were on sale for half price. Half of $48 is $48 / 2 = $24. So the shoes cost $24.

The athletic socks cost $8, and she had a coupon for $2 off, so she paid $8 - $2 = $6 for the socks.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $10 (tank top) + $15 (shorts) + $24 (shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55.

The final answer is: $55"
"To find the total cost, we need to find out how many tiles we need. Since each tile is a square with a side of 1ft, the area of one tile is 1ft * 1ft = 1 SqFt. 

To find out how many tiles we need, we divide the total area of the kitchen floor by the area of one tile. 

200 SqFt (kitchen floor area) / 1 SqFt (tile area) = 200 tiles

Now, we multiply the number of tiles by the cost of each tile to find the total cost.

200 tiles * $12 (cost per tile) = $2400

"To find out how much James pays a year, we need to first find out how much he pays a month. 

The normal cost is $120 a month. Since he had an accident, it's 60% more than normal. 

60% of $120 is 0.6 x 120 = $72. 

So, the cost after the accident is $120 + $72 = $192 a month.

To find out how much he pays a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12. 

$192 x 12 = $2304.

The final answer is: $2304"
"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a week, we need to know how many sets of sheets he has to wash. He has 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed, so he has 4 + 1 = 5 sets of sheets.

Since he can wash 2 twin sets at a time and 1 king set at a time, we need to find out how many twin sets and king sets he has to wash. He has 4 twin sets, so he has to wash 4 / 2 = 2 sets of twin sheets. He has 1 king set, so he has to wash 1 king set.

So, in a week, he does 2 loads of twin sheets and 1 load of king sheets, which is a total of 2 + 1 = 3 loads of laundry.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the number of loads of laundry he does in a week by 52 to find out how many loads he does in a year. 3 * 52 = 156.

"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount of cat food Imma feeds her cats each day (60 grams).

First, we need to find out how much cat food Imma feeds her cats in a day. Since she feeds her cats twice a day, we multiply 60 grams by 2.

60 grams * 2 = 120 grams per day

Now, we divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the daily amount (120 grams).

720 grams / 120 grams = 6

So, the cat food will last for 6 days.

We know that Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake did, Jake must have eaten 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

We also know that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake did. So, Silvia ate 2 x 7 = 14 slices.

Now, let's add up the total number of slices eaten by all three: Becky (10) + Jake (7) + Silvia (14) = 31 slices.

The total number of slices they ate is 31."
"Let's say Donovan's part took x minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes. 

The total time it took to make the meal is the sum of their parts, which is 98 minutes. So, we can write an equation: x + (x + 18) = 98.

Combine like terms: 2x + 18 = 98.

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's part took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

"To find out how many emails James responds to, we need to first find out how many emails he doesn't respond to. 

20% of 80 emails is 0.2 x 80 = 16 emails. 

So, James doesn't respond to 16 emails. 

To find out how many emails he responds to, we subtract 16 from 80. 

80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Now, we need to find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week. 

Since James gets 80 emails a day, in 5 days he gets 80 x 5 = 400 emails.

Out of those 400 emails, he responds to 64. 

So, in a 5-day work week, James responds to 64 emails.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find out how many pizzas they ate, we need to calculate 70% of 20. 

70% of 20 is 0.7 x 20 = 14 pizzas. 

So, the glee club ate 14 pizzas. That means they have 20 - 14 = 6 pizzas left.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 x 20 = 40 pizzas. 

They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 x 40 = 32 pizzas.

So, the football team has 40 - 32 = 8 pizzas left.

In total, the glee club has 6 pizzas left and the football team has 8 pizzas left.

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons. Twice as many means 2 times 700, which is 1400 big coupons.

Now, we need to find out how much each type of coupon costs to mail. Small coupons cost 5 cents and big coupons cost 15 cents.

To find the total cost of small coupons, we multiply the number of small coupons by the cost per small coupon: 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

To find the total cost of big coupons, we multiply the number of big coupons by the cost per big coupon: 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

Now, we add the cost of small coupons and big coupons to find the total cost: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

First, we need to find out how much Dennis will pay for 6 pounds of butter with the promotion. Since he gets one half off, he will pay for 3 pounds of butter at full price and 3 pounds of butter at half price. 

3 pounds of butter at full price will cost 3 * $4.00 = $12.00. 
3 pounds of butter at half price will cost 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.

"Melanie saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. To find out how many toothpicks she saved in total, we multiply the number of toothpicks she saved each week by the number of weeks.

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

She needs 200 toothpicks in total. To find out how many more toothpicks she needs, we subtract the number of toothpicks she already saved from the total number of toothpicks she needs.

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week, to find out how many weeks it will take her to collect the remaining toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she needs by the number of toothpicks she saves each week.

First, Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price. This means he paid 75% of $2000. 

To find 75% of $2000, we multiply 2000 by 0.75. 
2000 * 0.75 = 1500

So, Mr. Rogers bought the watch for $1500.

Then, he sold it to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it. This means he sold it for 120% of $1500.

To find 120% of $1500, we multiply 1500 by 1.2. 
1500 * 1.2 = 1800

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price. To do this, we need to find the difference between the original price and the price Mr. Rogers' friend paid, and then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100.

Original price = $2000
Price Mr. Rogers' friend paid = $1800

Discount = (Original price - Price Mr. Rogers' friend paid) / Original price * 100

"To find Frankie's score, we need to first find twice Binkie's score. Binkie's score is 90, so twice that is 2 x 90 = 180. 

Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score, so we add 15 to 180. 180 + 15 = 195.

Frankie's score was 195."
"To find out how long it took James to reach the store, we need to first find out how long it took him to walk to the store and back home, and then subtract the time it took him to walk back home.

First, let's find out how long it took him to walk to the store.  Since he walked 4 miles to the store and he walks 4 miles per hour, we can divide the distance by the speed to get the time. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

Now, let's find out how long it took him to walk back home.  Since he walked 4 miles back home and he walks 4 miles per hour, we can divide the distance by the speed to get the time.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

Since he walked to the store and back home, we need to add the time it took him to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.

Total time = Time to walk to the store + Time to walk back home
Total time = 1 hour + 1 hour
Total time = 2 hours

However, the question asks for the time it took him to reach the store.  We need to subtract the time it took him to walk back home from the total time.

Time to reach the store = Total time - Time to walk back home
Time to reach the store = 2 hours - 1 hour
Time to reach the store = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we need to first find out how much she would have paid if she bought the bananas individually and then subtract that from the amount she paid for the bunches.

If Jenny bought the bananas individually, she would have bought 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas. Since each banana costs $0.80, she would have paid 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

Jenny bought the bunches for $3.00 each, so she paid 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

To find out how much she saved, we subtract the amount she paid for the bunches from the amount she would have paid for the individual bananas: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"Let's say Sam gets x feet of the fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet. 

We know that the total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up an equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. 

The leftover fence for Sam is 0 feet because they split the fence equally."
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we need to know its growth rate per year. 

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. To find the growth rate per year, we divide the total growth by the number of years: 8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year.

Now, we multiply the growth rate per year by the number of years to find the total growth: 2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches.

The final answer is: 26"
"Let's break down the information given. 

First, we know that half of the bikes sold were Trekking bikes. Since there were 300 bikes sold, half of them would be 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

Next, we know that 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes. 15% of 300 is 0.15 x 300 = 45 BMX bikes.

Now, we know that the rest of the bikes sold were MTB type. Since we already know that 150 were Trekking and 45 were BMX, the number of MTB bikes sold would be 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

We also know the prices of each type of bike: MTB is $500, BMX is half the price of MTB which is $250, and Trekking is $450.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:
- MTB bikes: 105 bikes * $500 = $52,500
- BMX bikes: 45 bikes * $250 = $11,250
- Trekking bikes: 150 bikes * $450 = $67,500

Now, let's add up the total earnings from all types of bikes:
$52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

The farmer makes 5 bales of hay each hour. If they work for 6 hours, they will make 5 * 6 = 30 bales of hay.

The truck picks up 3 bales of hay each hour. If the truck works for 6 hours, it will pick up 3 * 6 = 18 bales of hay.

To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to subtract the number of bales the truck picked up from the total number of bales made by the farmer. 

So, 30 (total bales made by the farmer) - 18 (bales picked up by the truck) = 12 bales of hay left in the field.

"To find out how many minutes John spends in class, we need to multiply the number of classes he takes by the number of minutes per class and the number of days he goes to class.

John takes 2 extra classes and 6 normal classes, so he takes 2 + 6 = 8 classes in total. Each class is 40 minutes long, so he spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes in class per day. 

Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes in class per week.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. 1/16 of his weekly minutes is the extra time he spends on the weekend. 

There are 7 days in a week, so his total weekly minutes are 7 * 24 * 60 = 1680 minutes (assuming a 24-hour day). 

1/16 of 1680 is 1680 / 16 = 105 minutes.

So, John spends 105 minutes on Saturday and Sunday.

Now, we need to add the minutes he spends in class and the minutes he spends on the weekend. 1600 + 105 = 1705 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 1705 / 60 = 28.42 hours.

The final answer is: 28.42"
"To find out how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to find out how high it goes on its first bounce. 

The ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony, which is 3 * 24 = 72 feet high. 

The ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height, so on the first bounce, it goes up 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, it will go up 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find out how tall the fourth child is, we need to find out how tall the first child is in inches, then add the differences in height for each child.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we multiply 6 feet by 12 inches to get the height in inches. 

6 feet * 12 inches/foot = 72 inches

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so we add 2 inches to the height of the first child.

72 inches + 2 inches = 74 inches

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so we subtract 5 inches from the height of the second child.

74 inches - 5 inches = 69 inches

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so we add 3 inches to the height of the third child.

69 inches + 3 inches = 72 inches

The fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to know how many bags of apples they sold. Since they sold 2000 apples and each bag has 10 apples, we can divide 2000 by 10 to find the number of bags.

2000 ÷ 10 = 200

So, the orchard sold 200 bags of apples. 

Now, we need to multiply the number of bags by the price per bag to find the total earnings. 

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The final answer is: $1000"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. Before that, the velociraptors ate half of what was left. So, the velociraptors ate half of 270 kilograms, which is 270 / 2 = 135 kilograms. 

Now, the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, and the velociraptors ate 135 kilograms. So, the total amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate was 270 + 135 = 405 kilograms. 

The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the total amount of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was 405 * 2 = 810 kilograms.

The final answer is: 810"
"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to find the total area of the walls and then divide it by the area one gallon of paint can cover. 

First, let's find the area of each wall:
- North and south walls: 10 x 8 = 80 square feet each. Since there are two of them, their total area is 2 x 80 = 160 square feet.
- East and west walls: 5 x 8 = 40 square feet each. Since there are two of them, their total area is 2 x 40 = 80 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the walls: 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since one gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need to divide the total area by 20 to find out how many gallons we need: 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Now, let's find the total cost: 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to find out how many shaken sodas are left and how many cans are left in total.

Ellen started with 12 sodas and shook 3 of them. So, 9 sodas were unshaken. She took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.

Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas. So, there are now 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas left.

Now, Ellen's friend has 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas to choose from. The likelihood of getting a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas.

There are 2 shaken sodas and 8 sodas in total. 

The likelihood is 2/8 = 0.25. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100.

0.25 * 100 = 25%

"Let's break it down. One train is traveling 60 miles per hour, and the other is traveling half that distance per hour, so it's 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour.

Since they're traveling in opposite directions, we need to add their speeds together to find the total distance they're covering. So, 60 + 30 = 90 miles per hour.

Now, we need to find out how far they've traveled in 3 hours. We multiply the total speed by the time: 90 miles per hour * 3 hours = 270 miles.

So, after 3 hours, the two trains are 270 miles apart.

"To find out how many people Billy helps, we need to know how many days he works and how many people he can help per day. 

First, let's find out how many days are between March 1st and April 19th. March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th. So, 31 + 19 = 50 days. 

Now, we need to find out how many days Billy takes off. He takes 20% of the days off. 20% of 50 is 0.2 x 50 = 10 days. 

So, Billy works 50 - 10 = 40 days. 

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he can help 2 x 3 = 6 people per day. 

Now, we multiply the number of days he works by the number of people he can help per day. 40 days x 6 people per day = 240 people.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find out how many people were inside the church, we need to find out how many people were outside the church first. 

There were 20 private cars and 12 buses. Each bus carried 35 people and each car carried 3 people. 

First, let's find out how many people were in the buses. 
12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people in the buses.

Next, let's find out how many people were in the cars. 
20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people in the cars.

Now, let's add the number of people in the buses and the cars to find out how many people were outside the church. 
420 people in the buses + 60 people in the cars = 480 people outside the church.

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the number of people outside the church from the total number of people. However, we don't know the total number of people. 

But we can assume that the total number of people is the sum of the people inside and outside the church. 

Let's call the number of people inside the church 'x'. Then, the number of people outside the church is 480. 

The total number of people is x + 480. 

Since the total number of people is not given, we can't find the exact number of people inside the church."

"To find out how many hours Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to after 5 days, we need to calculate the total minutes first and then convert it to hours.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 x 15-minute breaks per day. 

Total minutes per day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 2 x 15 minutes (breaks) = 30 + 30 = 60 minutes

Since Bobby does this for 5 days, we multiply the total minutes per day by 5.

Total minutes in 5 days = 60 minutes/day x 5 days = 300 minutes

Now, we convert the total minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in 1 hour.

Total hours = Total minutes / 60 = 300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours

So, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours after 5 days.

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we need to know how many miles Micah ran first. We know Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran. Amber ran 8 miles, so Micah ran 3.5 x 8 = 28 miles. 

Now, we know Amber and Micah ran a total of 8 + 28 = 36 miles. To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we need to subtract 36 from the total miles they ran together, which is 52. 

52 - 36 = 16

Ahito ran 16 miles."
"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we need to subtract the cost of the item she returned from the initial charge. 
   Initial charge: $85.00
   Item returned: $15.00
   New balance after return: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

2. Next, we need to calculate the cost of the frying pan after the 20% discount.
   Original price of the frying pan: $20.00
   Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
   Price after discount: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

3. Then, we need to calculate the cost of the set of towels after the 10% discount.
   Original price of the towels: $30.00
   Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
   Price after discount: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

4. Now, we need to add the cost of the frying pan and the towels to the new balance after the return.
   New balance after return: $70.00
   Cost of frying pan: $16.00

"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know that a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. This means 1/3 of the large jellyfish change color, and the rest stay the same. 

Since 6 jellyfish changed color, this is 1/3 of the large jellyfish. To find the total number of large jellyfish, we can multiply 6 by 3. 

6 * 3 = 18

So, there are 18 large jellyfish in the tank. 

Now, we know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large. This means 1/5 of the total jellyfish are large. Since there are 18 large jellyfish, we can multiply 18 by 5 to find the total number of jellyfish in the tank.

18 * 5 = 90

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money Lauren needs to save for her retirement. 

First, we need to find out how much she will live on in retirement. 40% of her current salary is 0.4 x $100,000 = $40,000 per year.

Since she will live for 20 years, she will need $40,000 x 20 = $800,000 for retirement.

Now, we need to find out how much she will save each year. She saves 20% of her salary, which is 0.2 x $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

To find out how many years she needs to work, we need to divide the total amount she needs for retirement by the amount she saves each year. 

$800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work, but we need to subtract the 20 years she will live in retirement.

Toys made by 4 workers who produce 6 toys an hour = 240 toys
Toys made by 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour = 80 toys
Toys made by the fifth worker = Total toys made by all 5 workers - (Toys made by 4 workers who produce 6 toys an hour + Toys made by 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour)
Toys made by the fifth worker = 340 - (240 + 80)
Toys made by the fifth worker = 340 - 320
Toys made by the fifth worker = 20 toys

Now, we need to find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour.

Toys made by the fifth worker in 10 hours = 20 toys
Toys produced per hour by the fifth worker = 20 toys / 10 hours
Toys produced per hour by the fifth worker = 2 toys per hour

"To find out how much Elijah's dogs weigh, we need to find out how much the first dog weighs and the second dog weighs. 

First, we know Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog. To find out how much Elijah's first dog weighs, we need to divide 60 by 4. 

60 / 4 = 15

So, Elijah's first dog weighs 15 pounds. 

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog. To find out how much Elijah's second dog weighs, we need to divide 60 by 2.

60 / 2 = 30

So, Elijah's second dog weighs 30 pounds.

Now, we need to add up the weights of all the dogs to find out how much they weigh altogether. 

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog weighs 15 pounds. Elijah's second dog weighs 30 pounds. 

60 + 15 + 30 = 105

The final answer is: 105"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. This means Luis has half of Seth's stickers, and Seth has the other half. 

Luis used half of the stickers he got from Seth and gave the rest to Kris. This means Kris has half of the stickers Luis got, and Luis has the other half. Since Luis had half of Seth's stickers, Kris has a quarter of Seth's stickers, and Luis has a quarter of Seth's stickers.

Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. This means Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers. Since Kris has a quarter of Seth's stickers, we can set up an equation to find out how many stickers Seth had in the beginning.

Let's say Seth had x stickers in the beginning. Then Kris has x/4 stickers. We know Kris has 16 stickers, so x/4 = 16. 

To find x, we multiply both sides by 4. x = 16 * 4. 

x = 64

So Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

"To find out how many small bags John can make, we need to know the total number of M&M's he has. 

First, we find the total number of ounces of M&M's John has. He buys 3 large bags weighing 10 ounces each, so he has 3 x 10 = 30 ounces of M&M's.

Since an ounce of M&M's has 30 M&M's, we multiply the total ounces by 30 to find the total number of M&M's. 30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's.

Now, we need to find out how many small bags John can make. Each small bag has 10 M&M's, so we divide the total number of M&M's by 10. 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per small bag = 90 small bags.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to first find out how far that is. 

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers, and half of that is 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers. We know that Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. 

To find out how many days it will take, we need to divide the total distance (20,000 kilometers) by the distance Alfie flies every day (400 kilometers).

20,000 / 400 = 50

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so it can go 5 x 120 = 600 miles per hour.

Now, we know the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. To find the speed of the fastest car, we multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25. 

Speed of the fastest car = 1.25 x 600 = 750 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 750"
"Let's figure this out. 

Liam is 16 years old now. Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. 

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. So, two years ago, Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old. 

Now, we need to find out how old Vince is. Since two years have passed, we need to add 2 to Vince's age. So, Vince is 7 + 2 = 9 years old now.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Let's call this number 'A'. 

Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah. Let's call the number of eggs Sarah painted 'S'. Then, Camden painted S + 12 eggs.

We know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so we can write the equation: S + (S + 12) = 30. 

Combine like terms: 2S + 12 = 30.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 2S = 18.

Divide both sides by 2: S = 9.

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs. Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, let's call this number 'A'. We know that the total number of eggs painted is 56. We can write the equation: A + A + 21 + 9 = 56.

Combine like terms: 2A + 30 = 56.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2A = 26.

Divide both sides by 2: A = 13.

So, Arnold and Madeline each painted 13 eggs. 

Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs. To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we subtract: 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"Nik has 200 crayons. He wants to put them into boxes of 8 crayons each. To find out how many boxes he needs, we divide 200 by 8. 

200 / 8 = 25

So, Nik needs 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. Since there are 200 crayons, the total weight of the crayons is 200 ounces. 

The total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces. 

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 200 + 200 = 400 ounces. 

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we divide 400 by 16 to get the total weight in pounds.

400 / 16 = 25

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much John makes, we need to calculate the total number of planks he can make and then multiply it by the price of each plank.

First, John can make logs out of 80% of the 80-foot tree. 80% of 80 is 0.8 x 80 = 64 feet. 

Since he cuts the tree into 4-foot logs, we need to divide 64 by 4 to find out how many logs he can make. 64 / 4 = 16 logs.

From each log, he cuts 5 planks. So, the total number of planks he can make is 16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks.

He sells each plank for $1.2. To find out how much he makes, we multiply the total number of planks by the price of each plank: 80 planks * $1.2/plank = $96.

The final answer is: $96"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Valerie earns $5000 per month. Her brother earns 2 times what she earns, so he earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their combined salary is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to add their salaries. $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know that Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk as she does on the beach. 

Let's say her speed on the beach is x miles per minute. Then, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she spends 40 minutes on the beach. Since she walks 2 miles on the beach, her speed on the beach is 2 miles / 40 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute.

Now, we can find the speed on the sidewalk. Since it's twice the speed on the beach, it's 2 * 0.05 = 0.1 miles per minute.

Now, let's find the time it takes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk. Time = Distance / Speed. So, it takes 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk.

Now, we know that the total time spent on the sidewalk is 10 minutes for 1 mile. Since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk, the total time spent on the sidewalk is 10 minutes.

The total time spent on the beach is 40 minutes. The total time spent on the sidewalk is 10 minutes. The total time spent on the entire walk is 40 + 10 = 50 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Jane to save $60, we need to know how much she has saved so far and how much more she needs to save.

Jane has saved $4 every week for 8 weeks, so we multiply 4 by 8 to find out how much she has saved so far: 
4 x 8 = 32

Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60. We subtract the amount she has saved so far from the total amount she wants to save:
60 - 32 = 28

Since she saves $4 every week, we need to find out how many weeks it will take to save $28. We divide 28 by 4:
28 / 4 = 7

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles and has 60 marbles, we need to find out how many marbles he had initially. Since 1 dozen is 12, 2 dozen is 2 x 12 = 24. 

So, if he has 60 marbles after receiving 2 dozen more, we can subtract 24 from 60 to find out how many marbles he had initially. 60 - 24 = 36. 

Now, we know Bob had 36 marbles initially. If he loses 10 marbles, we need to subtract 10 from 36. 36 - 10 = 26.

So, Bob will have 26 marbles.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

Donny has two mugs of water. One is 33 degrees, and the other is unknown. He pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug into his water bottle. 

Since he can now drink the water, the temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees. 

When he pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug, the temperature of the 33-degree mug decreases by 4 ounces. Since the 33-degree mug is 8 ounces (assuming both mugs are 8 ounces), the temperature of the 33-degree mug after pouring is (33 - (4/8) * (33 - x)) degrees, where x is the temperature of the other mug. 

However, we don't know the temperature of the other mug, so we can't calculate the exact temperature of the 33-degree mug after pouring. 

But we do know that the temperature of the water in the bottle is at least 40 degrees. Since he poured 1 ounce from the other mug, the temperature of the other mug must be at least 40 degrees. 

So, the temperature of the other mug is at least 40 degrees."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many days are in three weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so three weeks have 3 x 7 = 21 days.

Now, let's calculate the number of cows added by Milkie Cows Limited. They bring 20 cows per day for 21 days, so the total number of cows added is 20 x 21 = 420.

The initial number of cows was 50, so after three weeks, the total number of cows will be 50 + 420 = 470.

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens added by Broilers Limited. They bring 10 chickens per day for 21 days, so the total number of chickens added is 10 x 21 = 210.

The initial number of chickens was 20, so after three weeks, the total number of chickens will be 20 + 210 = 230.

Now, we need to find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks. We add the total number of cows and chickens: 470 + 230 = 700.

"To find out how much each single bagel will cost, we need to first find out the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels and then divide it by the total number of bagels.

Each pack of bagels costs $10.00 and has 9 bagels. So, the total cost of 4 packs of bagels is 4 x $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell gets a 10% discount, we need to find 10% of $40.00 and subtract it from $40.00. 10% of $40.00 is 0.1 x $40.00 = $4.00. 

So, the total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Now, we need to find out how many bagels are in 4 packs. Since each pack has 9 bagels, 4 packs will have 4 x 9 = 36 bagels.

To find out the cost of each single bagel, we need to divide the total cost after the discount by the total number of bagels. So, the cost of each single bagel is $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know he ate 5 less than 23 scoops, so we can write that as 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. We know it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make that, so we can write that as 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes for 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. We can do that by dividing the number of potatoes by the number of scoops, so 3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes per scoop.

Now, we know Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes, and it takes 1.5 potatoes to make 1 scoop. So, we can multiply the number of scoops by the number of potatoes per scoop to find the total number of potatoes: 18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes/scoop = 27 potatoes.

"To find out how many eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in 30 days is 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in 30 days is 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

Now, we add the total number of eggs from both periods: 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Chester needs. 

240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen eggs.

Faraday earns $26 from the sunflowers per day. Since each sunflower costs $2, he sells 26 / 2 = 13 sunflowers per day.

He also earns $56 from the bouquets per day. Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers and costs $8, he sells 56 / 8 = 7 bouquets per day. 

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, he sells 7 * 12 = 84 sunflowers from the bouquets per day.

In total, he sells 13 + 84 = 97 sunflowers per day.

To find out how many sunflowers he sells in 3 days, we multiply 97 by 3. 

97 * 3 = 291

So, Faraday was able to sell 291 sunflowers after 3 days."

First, let's find the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday: 1907.
Then, let's find the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday: 2136.

Now, let's add the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday: 1907 + 2136 = 4043.

Now, let's subtract the total number of reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total number of reports received last week: 5168 - 4043 = 1125.

So, the IRS received 1125 reports on Wednesday.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land. 

He sold half of the land for $50. Half of 80 is 40, so he sold 40 square meters for $50. 

Now, he has 80 - 40 = 40 square meters left. 

Then, he sold 1/4 of his remaining land for $30. 1/4 of 40 is 10, so he sold 10 square meters for $30. 

Now, he has 40 - 10 = 30 square meters left. 

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, he will earn 30 * $3 = $90 from the remaining land. 

To find the total amount of money he earned, we need to add the money he earned from the first sale ($50), the second sale ($30), and the third sale ($90). 

$50 + $30 + $90 = $170

The final answer is: $170"
"To find Geb's age, we need to first find half of Haley's age. Haley is 26 years old, so half of 26 is 26 / 2 = 13. 

Geb is 10 less than half of Haley's age, so we need to subtract 10 from 13. 13 - 10 = 3.

Geb is 3 years old."
"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to know how many face masks he uses in a day and then multiply that by 2.

Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out, and he goes out three times a day. So, he uses 2 * 3 = 6 face masks every day.

Now, we need to multiply the number of face masks he uses in a day by 2 to find out how many he uses in 2 days. 6 * 2 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. 1 dozen is 12, so 3 dozen is 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs. 

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 x 5 = 10 eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the eggs that were found: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

To find out how many eggs are still hidden, we need to subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs. 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many apartments are in the last complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so together they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so we need to find 60% of 400. 

60% of 400 is 0.6 x 400 = 240. So the last complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we know that John collects garbage from 3 complexes, each with 200, 200, and 640 apartments. He collects garbage 3 times a week from each place. So, the total number of collections per week is 3 x 3 = 9.

Now, let's find the total number of apartments. 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment. So, the total amount he makes per collection is 1040 x $0.40 = $416.

Since he collects garbage 9 times a week, the total amount he makes in a week is $416 x 9 = $3744.

The final answer is: $3744"
"To find the total number of fruits the avocado tree can produce in its 10 years, we need to calculate the fruits produced each year and add them up.

- Year 1: 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
- Year 2: 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, so 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- Year 3: 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, so 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- Year 4: The tree is now 8 years old, but we don't know how many fruits it produces yet. We need to find out how many fruits a 10-year-old tree produces first.
- Year 5: The tree is still 8 years old, so it produces the same amount as the 8-year-old tree. We still don't know how many fruits it produces.
- Year 6: The tree is now 9 years old, but we still don't know how many fruits it produces.
- Year 7: The tree is 10 years old, but we still don't know how many fruits it produces.
- Year 8: The tree is now 11 years old, but we still don't know how many fruits it produces.
- Year 9: The tree doesn't produce any fruits.
- Year 10: A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, so 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, we know the fruits produced in years 1, 2, 3, and 10. We still need to find out the fruits produced in years 4, 5, 6, and 7.

We are given that an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits. So, an 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Since the tree is 8 years old in year 4, it produces 800 fruits. The tree is 9 years old in year 5, so it produces the same amount as the 9-year-old tree. We don't know how many fruits a 9-year-old tree produces yet.

We are given that a 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits. So, a 9-year-old tree produces 1000 - 350 = 650 fruits.

The tree is 9 years old in year 5, so it produces 650 fruits. The tree is 10 years old in year 6, so it produces the same amount as the 10-year-old tree, which is 1000 fruits. The tree is 11 years old in year 7, so it produces the same amount as the 11-year-old tree. We don't know how many fruits an 11-year-old tree produces yet.

We are given that a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits. An 8-year-old tree produces 800 fruits. So, an 11-year-old tree produces 1000 - 800 = 200 fruits.

The tree is 11 years old in year 7, so it produces 200 fruits. The tree is 12 years old in year 8, so it produces the same amount as the 12-year-old tree. We don't know how many fruits a 12-year-old tree produces yet.

We are given that a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits. An 11-year-old tree produces 200 fruits. So, a 12-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

The tree is 12 years old in year 8, so it produces 800 fruits. The tree is 13 years old in year 9, so it doesn't produce any fruits.

Now, we have all the fruits produced each year: 
- Year 1: 50 fruits
- Year 2: 150 fruits
- Year 3: 350 fruits
- Year 4: 800 fruits
- Year 5: 650 fruits
- Year 6: 1000 fruits
- Year 7: 200 fruits
- Year 8: 800 fruits
- Year 9: 0 fruits
- Year 10: 1000 fruits

Total fruits = 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 650 + 1000 + 200 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 4200

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Let's say the length of the blue rope is x. Since the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, the length of the yellow rope is x + 7.

The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is 4x.

We know that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. So, we can write an equation:

x + (x + 7) + 4x = 37

Combine like terms:

6x + 7 = 37

Subtract 7 from both sides:

6x = 30

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 5

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope:

Length of the red rope = 4x = 4(5) = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so if Ronnie has $5, Rissa has 3 x 5 = $15.

After they both gave an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's call the amount they gave 'x'. So, Ronnie is left with 5 - x and Rissa is left with 15 - x.

We know that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation: 15 - x = (4/5) * 15.

To solve for x, we multiply 15 by 4/5, which is 12. So, the equation becomes 15 - x = 12.

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation, which gives us -x = -3. Multiplying both sides by -1, we get x = 3.

So, Ronnie gave 3 dollars to their little sister. Now, we can find out how much money Ronnie has left by subtracting 3 from 5, which is 2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can say that the amount of red paint is equal to the amount of white paint and the amount of purple paint. Let's call this amount ""x"".

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half of it is yellow. So, the amount of yellow paint is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.

The remaining paint is used for red, white, and purple, which is 12 - 6 = 6 pints.

Since the amount of red, white, and purple paint is equal, we can say that the total amount of these three colors is 3x. We know that this total is 6 pints, so we can set up the equation 3x = 6.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 6 / 3 = 2.

So, the amount of red paint is x, which is 2 pints.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total area of the house, we need to find the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, then add them together.

First, let's find the area of one bedroom: 
Area of one bedroom = length * width = 20 * 12 = 240 square feet

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms = 4 * 240 = 960 square feet

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area = 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add them together: 
Total area of the house = area of bedrooms + area of living room + area of the rest of the house
Total area of the house = 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet

The final answer is: 3160"

On Monday, Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds. 
On Tuesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Monday, so she counts 3 * 2 = 6 clouds. 
On Wednesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Tuesday, so she counts 6 * 2 = 12 clouds. 
On Thursday, she counts double the number of clouds from Wednesday, so she counts 12 * 2 = 24 clouds. 
On Friday, she counts double the number of clouds from Thursday, so she counts 24 * 2 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add up all the clouds she counted: 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93.

"To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run with the new box, we need to know how many pods are in the new box. 

The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box. To find 20% of 100, we multiply 100 by 0.2. 

100 x 0.2 = 20

So the new box has 20 more pods than the regular box. To find the total number of pods in the new box, we add 20 to 100.

100 + 20 = 120

Now we know the new box has 120 pods. If you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 120 cycles with the new box. 

To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to know how many cycles you can run with the new box for $12. Since the new box costs $12, we divide 120 by 12 to find out how many cycles you can run for $12.

120 / 12 = 10

Now we know you can run 10 cycles for $12. To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we divide 10 by 12.

10 / 12 = 0.83333333333

But we want the answer in a whole number, so we round down to the nearest whole number.

He triples his money, so he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since each bill is now 5 dollars, he still has 60 bills, but each is worth 5 dollars. 

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's break it down step by step.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 x 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 x 8 = 2 goals.

So, in the first half, team A scores 4 goals and team B scores 2 goals. In the second half, team A scores 2 goals and team B scores 8 goals.

The total number of goals scored by team A is 4 + 2 = 6 goals. The total number of goals scored by team B is 2 + 8 = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 + 10 = 16.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. He uses 45% of it on Monday, so we need to find 45% of 5 inches. 

45% of 5 inches is 0.45 x 5 = 2.25 inches. 

This means the teacher has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches left. 

Now, the teacher will use 20% of the chalk each day. We need to find out how many days it will take for him to use up the remaining 2.75 inches. 

Let's divide 2.75 by 20% (or 0.2). 

2.75 / 0.2 = 13.75 

Since the teacher can't use a fraction of a day, we'll round down to 13.75 days. However, we need to consider that the teacher will recycle the chalk when it's smaller than 2 inches. 

2.75 inches is larger than 2 inches, so the teacher can use it for 13 days. On the 14th day, he will recycle the chalk.

"To find out how many students are not on varsity, we need to first find out how many students are on varsity. 

One-third of the girls are on varsity. Since there are 12 girls, we can find one-third of 12 by dividing 12 by 3. 12 / 3 = 4. So, 4 girls are on varsity.

One-fourth of the boys are on varsity. Since there are 12 boys, we can find one-fourth of 12 by dividing 12 by 4. 12 / 4 = 3. So, 3 boys are on varsity.

Now, we add the number of girls and boys on varsity to find the total number of students on varsity. 4 girls + 3 boys = 7 students on varsity.

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students. There are 12 boys and 12 girls, so the total number of students is 12 + 12 = 24. 

24 - 7 = 17 students are not on varsity.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Colin's current age is x.

Since Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now, we can write an equation:

Wendy's current age = 5 * (Colin's age in 7 years)
Wendy's current age = 5 * (x + 7)

We know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, we can write another equation:

Colin's age in 25 years = (1/3) * Wendy's current age
x + 25 = (1/3) * (5 * (x + 7))

Now, let's simplify the second equation:

x + 25 = (1/3) * (5x + 35)
x + 25 = (5x + 35)/3
3x + 75 = 5x + 35
75 - 35 = 5x - 3x

"To find out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to find out how many slices of cheese pizza and pepperoni pizza are eaten in total.

Kate's 6 friends each eat 6 cheese pizza slices, so they eat 6 x 6 = 36 cheese pizza slices. Since Kate also eats, we need to add 6 more slices, so 36 + 6 = 42 cheese pizza slices.

Kate's 6 friends each eat 4 pepperoni pizza slices, so they eat 6 x 4 = 24 pepperoni pizza slices. Since Kate also eats, we need to add 4 more slices, so 24 + 4 = 28 pepperoni pizza slices.

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, we need to divide the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten by 12 to find out how many cheese pizzas Kate needs to buy. 42 / 12 = 3.5. Since we can't buy half a pizza, Kate needs to buy 4 cheese pizzas.

Since the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to divide the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten by 8 to find out how many pepperoni pizzas Kate needs to buy. 28 / 8 = 3.5. Since we can't buy half a pizza, Kate needs to buy 4 pepperoni pizzas.

Jay can build 20 snowballs in 1 hour. To find out how many he can build in 15 minutes, we need to divide 20 by 4 (since there are 4 15-minute intervals in an hour). 

20 / 4 = 5 snowballs in 15 minutes. 

Now, let's find out how many snowballs he can build in 1 hour. We already know that, it's 20. 

But, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. So, in 1 hour, 8 snowballs will melt (2 * 4 = 8). 

So, Jay will have 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs after 1 hour. 

To find out how many more snowballs he needs, we subtract 12 from 60. 

60 - 12 = 48. 

Since Jay can build 5 snowballs every 15 minutes, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals it will take to build 48 snowballs. 

48 / 5 = 9.6. 

Since we can't have a fraction of an interval, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. 

9.6 is closer to 10 than 9, so it will take 10 intervals of 15 minutes to build 48 snowballs. 

10 intervals of 15 minutes is equal to 150 minutes. 

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60. 

150 / 60 = 2.5 hours. 

So, it will take Jay 2.5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

Now, we know that 20 years ago, John was 8 years old and he was twice as old as Jim. To find Jim's age, we divide John's age by 2: 8 / 2 = 4. 

So, Jim was 4 years old 20 years ago. To find Jim's current age, we add 20 to his age 20 years ago: 4 + 20 = 24.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, they had 38 + 50 = 88 bandages at the end of the first day.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. So, they had 88 - 28 = 60 bandages at the end of the second day.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages, which is 2 x 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, they used a total of 100 - 25 = 75 bandages on the third day. They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.

Now, let's add up the bandages they used on the third day and the ones they had left: 78 + 75 = 153. This is the total number of bandages they had at the end of the second day.

So, the total number of bandages they had at the end of the second day is 153. We already know they had 60 bandages at the end of the second day. To find out how many bandages they had at the start of the second day, we need to add the bandages they used on the second day to the ones they had at the end of the second day: 153 - 60 = 93.

Now, let's add the bandages they used on the first day to the ones they had at the end of the first day: 93 + 60 = 153. This is the total number of bandages they had at the start of the first day.

The final answer is: 153"
"To find out how much May's cut and color cost, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut and the cost of the color separately, then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the haircut. The haircut costs $30 per inch, and May's hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches. So, the length of hair cut is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

The cost of the haircut is 2 inches * $30 per inch = $60.

Next, we know the color costs $40.

Now, let's add the cost of the haircut and the color together: $60 + $40 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To find out how much Jen will receive, we need to calculate her total hours worked and then multiply it by her hourly rate. We also need to add the attendance bonus.

Jen works 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week. So, her total hours worked in a week is 7.5 * 6 = 45 hours.

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total hours worked in April is 45 * 4 = 180 hours.

Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her total earnings from her hourly rate is 180 * $1.5 = $270.

Jen also receives an additional $10 for complete attendance. Since she didn't incur any absences, she will receive the attendance bonus for all 4 weeks, which is $10 * 4 = $40.

So, her total earnings for April will be $270 + $40 = $310.

The final answer is: $310"
"To find out how much money Jason earned, we need to add up the money he earned from each task. 

First, let's find out how much money Jason earned from each task in a two-week period:

- Laundry: $3.00 (he did it once)
- Cleaning his room: $1.50 (he did it once)
- Taking the trash to the curb: $0.75 (he did it twice) = 2 x $0.75 = $1.50
- Emptying the dishwasher: $0.50 (he did it 6 times) = 6 x $0.50 = $3.00

Now, let's add up the money Jason earned from each task: 
$3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (cleaning his room) + $1.50 (taking the trash) + $3.00 (emptying the dishwasher) = $8.00

The final answer is: $8.00"
"To find out how much blood ten sharks have, we need to know how much blood one shark has. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, we multiply 40 by 3 to find out how much blood one shark has.

40 * 3 = 120 gallons of blood for one shark.

Now, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have. We multiply the amount of blood one shark has by 10.

120 * 10 = 1200 gallons of blood for ten sharks.

The final answer is: 1200"
"Let's break it down step by step.

First, 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning. 

Then, 40 more people entered at 10:00. 

The number of people who entered at 10:00 is 40. 

Twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 is 2 x 40 = 80. 

So, 80 more people entered the restaurant after a while. 

Now, we have 50 + 40 + 80 = 170 people. 

By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. 

The number of people who came in first is 50. 

Three times 50 is 3 x 50 = 150. 

So, 150 more people entered the restaurant by evening. 

Now, we have 170 + 150 = 320 people. 

The total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320.

320"
"So, Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Each pack has 5 pens, so she bought 5 x 5 = 25 red pens.

She also bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. That means she bought 2 x 25 = 50 black pens.

To find the total number of pens, we need to add the number of red pens and black pens. 25 + 50 = 75.

So, Alain has 75 pens."
"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know that John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600. To find the cost of one bottle of scotch, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles: $600 / 10 = $60 per bottle.

Now, we know that John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch. Since he bought 10 bottles of scotch, he buys 10 x 2 = 20 bottles of cognac.

We also know that the cognac costs 50% more than the scotch. 50% of $60 is $30, so the cognac costs $60 + $30 = $90 per bottle.

To find the total cost of the cognac, we multiply the number of bottles by the cost per bottle: 20 x $90 = $1800.

Now, we add the cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total cost: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, so he planted 2 x 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so he planted a total of 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day. 1/4 of 40 is 10, so he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees.

Now, let's add up the total number of trees planted in the two days. 
White Oak trees: 20 + 30 = 50
Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 + 50 = 90
Total trees: 50 + 90 = 140

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer. Then, his children drank 4 gallons, so we subtract 4 from 24. 24 - 4 = 20 gallons. 

Next, his wife spilled 7 gallons, so we subtract 7 from 20. 20 - 7 = 13 gallons. 

Then, Ronnie drank 5 gallons, so we subtract 5 from 13. 13 - 5 = 8 gallons. 

Now, 3 people showed up for the party, and they shared the remaining root beer equally. To find out how much each person got, we need to divide 8 by 3. 

8 ÷ 3 = 2.67 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.67}$"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Let's say the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is x.

The problem says ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" which means we need to multiply the number of coffee mugs by 4 and then add 8.

So, the equation would be: 4x + 8 = 40

Now, we need to solve for x. To do that, we need to get rid of the 8 on the left side of the equation. We can do that by subtracting 8 from both sides.

4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Now, we need to get rid of the 4 that's being multiplied by x. We can do that by dividing both sides by 4.

4x / 4 = 32 / 4
x = 8

So, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"To find out how many fish have red stripes, we need to divide the total number of fish by 3. 

66 / 3 = 22

So, 22 fish have red stripes. 

Now, we need to find out how many fish are left after removing the ones with red stripes. 

66 - 22 = 44

Now, we need to find out how many fish have blue stripes. We are given that 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. 

5/11 * 44 = 20

So, 20 fish have blue stripes. 

Now, we need to find out how many fish have red stripes and blue stripes. We add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes. 

22 + 20 = 42

"Amy had 2 palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 x 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors from the palettes. 

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so she had 3 x 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister stole one palette, so Amy lost 4 eyeshadow colors. Now, Amy has 26 - 4 = 22 eyeshadow colors left.

Amy used up half of the colors from one makeup set. One makeup set has 6 colors, so half of that is 6 / 2 = 3 eyeshadow colors. 

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know Mattison's height is 60 inches. His house is 7 times as high as he is, so the total height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The house has two stories, and we know the total height of the house is 420 inches. The first floor's height is three times Mattison's height, which is 3 * 60 = 180 inches. 

To find the height of the second floor, we subtract the first floor's height from the total height of the house: 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

Now, we need to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor. Since the second floor's height is 240 inches, and we know the first floor's height is 180 inches, the height of the second floor is 240 - 180 = 60 inches.

However, the question asks for the height of the roof from the second floor's floor. This means we need to add the height of the first floor to the height of the second floor to get the total height of the house, and then subtract that from the total height of the house to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor. But that's not what we need to do. We need to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, which is the same as the height of the first floor because the roof is above the first floor. 

So, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 180 inches.

The final answer is: 180"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that team Alphas found 40% of the shells. To find 40% of 700, we multiply 700 by 0.4. 

700 * 0.4 = 280 shells found by team Alphas.

Now, we need to find out how many shells are left. Since team Alphas found 280 shells, we subtract that from the total number of shells. 

700 - 280 = 420 shells left.

Now, team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells. To find 60% of 420, we multiply 420 by 0.6.

420 * 0.6 = 252 shells found by team The finders.

Now, we need to find out how many shells are left. Since team The finders found 252 shells, we subtract that from the remaining shells.

420 - 252 = 168 shells left.

These remaining shells were found by team Gogetters.

"Let's break it down. We know that the average of the miles the dogs need to walk is 3 miles. We also know that there are 4 dogs. 

To find the total miles they need to walk, we multiply the average miles by the number of dogs: 3 miles * 4 dogs = 12 miles.

We already know the miles the first, second, and third dogs need to walk. Let's add those up: 1 mile + 4 miles + 3 miles = 8 miles.

Now, we subtract the miles the first three dogs need to walk from the total miles they need to walk: 12 miles - 8 miles = 4 miles.

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles. 

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much money John got from the loan, we need to calculate 40% of the value of his house. 

40% of $250,000 is 0.4 x 250,000 = $100,000.

Now, John uses 60% of this amount to pay off his debts. 60% of $100,000 is 0.6 x 100,000 = $60,000.

So, John used $60,000 to pay off his debts. To find out how much money he has leftover, we need to subtract this amount from the loan amount.

$100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000.

"To find Trinity's profit, we need to find out how much she sold the magazines for and then subtract the cost from the selling price.

First, let's find out how much she sold the magazines for. We know she sold them at 11/8 of the price she bought them for. 

The price she bought the magazines for is $72. 

To find 11/8 of $72, we multiply 72 by 11 and then divide by 8.

First, multiply 72 by 11: 72 * 11 = 792

Then, divide 792 by 8: 792 / 8 = 99

So, Trinity sold the magazines for $99.

Now, let's find her profit. Profit is the selling price minus the cost.

Profit = Selling price - Cost
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the water removed on each setting and add them up.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Brian ran it for 3 days, so the total water removed on the low setting is 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes 2 liters of water per day. Brian ran it for 3 days, so the total water removed on the medium setting is 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes 2 * 2 = 4 liters of water per day. Brian ran it for 5 days, so the total water removed on the high setting is 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

Now, we add up the water removed on each setting: 3 liters (low) + 6 liters (medium) + 20 liters (high) = 29 liters.

Total number of balloons = 10 packs * 30 balloons per pack
Total number of balloons = 10 * 30
Total number of balloons = 300

Now, we know they had 300 balloons in total and 12 are left. 

Number of balloons thrown = Total number of balloons - Number of balloons left
Number of balloons thrown = 300 - 12
Number of balloons thrown = 288

For the first medicine: 14 mL * 8 = 112 mL
For the second medicine: 42 mL * 8 = 336 mL

So, in 8 doses, there would be 112 mL of the first medicine and 336 mL of the second medicine.

The total amount of medicine in 8 doses is 112 + 336 = 448 mL."

Since John has two classes, we multiply 15 by 2 to get the total capacity of John's classes. 
15 * 2 = 30 students.

Now, we add the capacity of Ali's class and John's classes to get the combined capacity of both schools.

"To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to first find out how much he will pay in the first 11 months. 

Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, so he will pay 11 x $25 = $275 in the first 11 months.

Now, we need to find out how much interest he owes his sister. The interest is 2% of the original amount, which is 2% of $300. To find 2% of $300, we multiply $300 by 0.02. 

$300 x 0.02 = $6

So, the total amount Stephen owes his sister is $300 (the original amount) + $6 (the interest) = $306.

In the twelfth month, Stephen will pay the remaining amount, which is $306 - $275 (the amount he paid in the first 11 months) = $31.

"To find the total number of jelly beans, we need to find the volume of the jar and divide it by the volume of one jelly bean, then multiply by the efficiency and the percentage of red jelly beans.

The volume of the jar is 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

The volume of one jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches.

The total number of jelly beans is 540 / 0.15 = 3600.

The efficiency is 80%, so the actual number of jelly beans is 3600 * 0.8 = 2880.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the number of red jelly beans is 2880 * 0.3 = 864.

However, the true number of red jelly beans is 900. 

To find how far off his guess was, we need to find the difference between his guess and the true number of red jelly beans. 

Since we don't know his guess, we need to find the number of red jelly beans he would have guessed if he used the same method. 

The number of red jelly beans he would have guessed is 3600 * 0.3 = 1080.

The difference between his guess and the true number of red jelly beans is 1080 - 900 = 180.

"First, we need to find out how much Pauline spent in the first 5 years. Since she visits the museum 3 times a year, she visits 3 * 5 = 15 times in 5 years. The cost of one visit is $2, so she spent 15 * 2 = $30 in the first 5 years.

Then, the cost of one visit increased by 150%. This means the new cost of one visit is 2 + (2 * 1.5) = 2 + 3 = $5. 

In the next 3 years, she still visits 3 times a year, so she visits 3 * 3 = 9 times in 3 years. The cost of one visit is now $5, so she spent 9 * 5 = $45 in the next 3 years.

To find the total amount Pauline spent, we add the money she spent in the first 5 years and the money she spent in the next 3 years. So, 30 + 45 = $75.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

Let's say the number of cupcakes Carly made is C. Since she makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, the number of brownies she made is 3C - 2.

We know that each person gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. So, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, so we can write the equation: C + (3C - 2) = 10.

Now, let's solve for C. First, we combine like terms: C + 3C - 2 = 10, which becomes 4C - 2 = 10.

Next, we add 2 to both sides of the equation: 4C = 10 + 2, which becomes 4C = 12.

Finally, we divide both sides by 4: C = 12 / 4, which becomes C = 3.

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"To find the price of the toy after it was discounted in January, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, we need to find the price of the toy in December after it increased by 80%. 
   The original price of the toy is $40. 
   To find the price after an 80% increase, we multiply the original price by 1.8 (100% + 80% = 180%, or 1 + 1.8 = 2.8, then 40 * 2.8 = 112).

2. Now, we need to find the price of the toy in January after it decreased by 50% from the price in December.
   The price in December is $112. 
   To find the price after a 50% decrease, we multiply the price in December by 0.5 (100% - 50% = 50%, or 1 - 0.5 = 0.5, then 112 * 0.5 = 56).

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $56."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make, we need to calculate the money he makes from the standard lessons and the money he makes from the lessons with the veteran.

First, let's calculate the money he makes from the standard lessons. He has 4 lessons at $80 each, so that's 4 x $80 = $320.

Now, let's calculate the money he makes from the lessons with the veteran. He reduces his rate by 25%, so his new rate is 75% of $80, which is 0.75 x $80 = $60. He has 2 lessons at this rate, so that's 2 x $60 = $120.

Now, let's add the money he makes from the standard lessons and the lessons with the veteran. $320 + $120 = $440.

The final answer is: $440"
"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and then divide by the number of scores.

First, let's add up all the scores: 
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

Now, we have the total score, which is 630. There are 9 scores in total. 

To find the mean, we divide the total score by the number of scores: 
630 ÷ 9 = 70

The final answer is: 70"
"Let's break it down. Eve had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving some away, she's left with 1/4 of the original amount. 

1/4 of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5. 

So, Eve is left with 5 pomelos. 

If Eve had 20 and is left with 5, she must have given away 20 - 5 = 15 pomelos.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break it down step by step.

Walter bought 60 apples. He ate 2/5 of them. To find out how many apples he ate, we need to multiply 60 by 2/5.

60 * (2/5) = 60 * 2 / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, let's find out how many apples are left. 

60 - 24 = 36

Now, he gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples. To find 25% of 36, we need to multiply 36 by 0.25.

36 * 0.25 = 9

So, he gave his sister 9 apples. Now, let's find out how many apples are left.

36 - 9 = 27

Now, he sold the remaining apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find out how much money he received, we need to multiply the number of apples left by the price per apple.

27 * 3 = 81

The final answer is: 81"
"Let's break it down. If 9 novels is 3 quarters of the number of novels she wrote this year, we can set up an equation to solve for the total number of novels she wrote this year.

Let x be the total number of novels she wrote this year. 

Since 9 novels is 3 quarters of x, we can write the equation as:

9 = (3/4)x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4/3:

x = 9 * (4/3)
x = 12

So, Regina wrote 12 novels this year.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how much distance Michael covers in 3 days, we need to multiply his speed by the number of hours in 3 days. 

There are 24 hours in a day, so 3 days have 3 x 24 = 72 hours.

Now, we multiply his speed (50 km/hr) by the number of hours (72 hours) to get the total distance covered: 50 km/hr * 72 hr = 3600 km.

Now, we need to find out what percentage of the total distance (6000 km) he has covered. To do this, we divide the distance covered (3600 km) by the total distance (6000 km) and multiply by 100.

(3600 km / 6000 km) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 6 x 5 = 30 grapes. 

Now, we have the total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother, which is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes. 

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Each pie requires 12 grapes, so she used 4 x 12 = 48 grapes. 

Now, we have the total number of grapes used by the mother, which is 48 grapes. 

To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we need to add the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and her mother. So, the total number of grapes at the beginning is 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how many teachers were at school that day, we need to add the number of teachers who were sick and the number of substitute teachers.

"To find out how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to first find out how much he spends in one week. 

The pasta costs $1.00 a box. 
He spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese. 
He spends twice that amount on gruyere cheese, which is 2 x $3.00 = $6.00.

So, the total cost of cheese is $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00. 
The total cost of making macaroni and cheese in one week is $1.00 (pasta) + $9.00 (cheese) = $10.00.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the weekly cost by 52 to find the yearly cost. 
$10.00 x 52 = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520.00"
"To find out how many classrooms the custodian can clean in a day, we need to multiply the number of hours they work in a day by the number of classrooms they can clean in an hour. 

First, let's find out how many classrooms they can clean in an hour. Since it takes them 15 minutes per classroom, we need to convert the time to hours. 15 minutes is 15/60 = 0.25 hours. 

Now, we can divide 1 hour by 0.25 hours to find out how many classrooms they can clean in an hour. 1 / 0.25 = 4 classrooms per hour.

Now, we multiply the number of classrooms they can clean in an hour by the number of hours they work in a day. 4 classrooms/hour * 8 hours = 32 classrooms per day.

Now, we need to find out how many classrooms they need to clean in total. There are 80 classrooms. 

To find out how many days it will take them to clean all the classrooms, we divide the total number of classrooms by the number of classrooms they can clean in a day. 80 classrooms / 32 classrooms per day = 2.5 days.

Since they have 5 days to get it done, we need to find out how many classrooms they will clean in 5 days. 32 classrooms per day * 5 days = 160 classrooms.

Now, we need to find out how many classrooms they will clean in 4.5 days. 32 classrooms per day * 4.5 days = 144 classrooms.

Now, we need to find out how many classrooms are left to clean. 80 classrooms - 144 classrooms = 36 classrooms.

Now, we need to find out how many hours they will work to clean the remaining classrooms. 36 classrooms / 32 classrooms per day = 1.125 days.

Now, we need to find out how many hours they will work to clean the remaining classrooms. 1.125 days * 8 hours per day = 9 hours.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes they will work to clean the remaining classrooms. 9 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 540 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes they will work in total. 8 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 480 minutes.

Now, we need to find out what percentage of their day is spent cleaning classrooms. (540 minutes / 480 minutes) * 100 = 112.5%

The final answer is: 112.5"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know that each middle shelf can hold 10 books. Since there are 2 middle shelves, they can hold 2 x 10 = 20 books.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 x 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's add up the total number of books that one bookcase can hold: 20 (middle shelf) + 20 (bottom shelf) + 15 (top shelf) = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to find out how many bookcases she needs to hold all of them. To do this, we'll divide the total number of books by the number of books one bookcase can hold: 110 / 55 = 2.

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"To find Rose's profit, we need to find out how much she paid for the eggs and how much she will get from selling them.

First, let's find out how much she paid for the eggs. She bought 5 dozens of eggs for $2.40 a dozen. 

1 dozen = 12 eggs
5 dozen = 5 x 12 = 60 eggs

Cost of 5 dozen eggs = 5 x $2.40 = $12

Now, let's find out how much she will get from selling the eggs. She will sell 1 egg for $1, but she has 60 eggs. 

Number of sets of 3 eggs = 60 / 3 = 20 sets
Cost of 1 set of 3 eggs = $1
Cost of 20 sets of 3 eggs = 20 x $1 = $20

Now, let's find out her profit. Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = $20 - $12
Profit = $8

The final answer is: $8"
"To find out how many white hats Skyler has, we need to first find out how many hats are red and blue. 

Half of the hats are red, so that's 100 / 2 = 50 red hats.

Now, we need to find out how many hats are remaining. We already know that 50 hats are red, so we subtract that from the total number of hats: 100 - 50 = 50 hats remaining.

3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, so we multiply 50 by 3/5: 50 * 3/5 = 30 blue hats.

Now, we know that 50 hats are red and 30 hats are blue. To find out how many hats are white, we subtract the number of red and blue hats from the total number of hats: 100 - 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much each stick of jerky costs, we need to first find out the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and there's a $3.00 discount. 

$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

So, the total cost of the bag after the discount is $15.00.

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we need to divide the total cost by the number of sticks to find the cost per stick.

$15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50

Since we need the answer in cents, we multiply the cost per stick by 100.

$0.50 * 100 = 50 cents

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we need to know how many questions she needs to get right in total. 

First, let's find out how many questions she needs to get right in total. Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions right, and there are 2 tests, we need to find the total number of questions first. The first test has 70 questions and the second test has 40 questions. 

Total questions = 70 + 40 = 110

Now, we need to find 70% of 110. 

70% of 110 = 0.7 x 110 = 77

So, Audrey needs to get 77 questions right in total. 

Now, let's find out how many questions she got right in the first test. 

She got 60% of 70 questions right. 

60% of 70 = 0.6 x 70 = 42

So, she got 42 questions right in the first test. 

Now, let's find out how many questions she needs to get right in the second test. 

She needs to get 77 questions right in total and she already got 42 questions right in the first test. 

So, she needs to get 77 - 42 = 35 questions right in the second test.

"Let's say the number of strawberry cubes is x. 

The number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so it's 5x - 4.

The total number of ice cubes is 116, which is the sum of strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes. So, we can write the equation: x + (5x - 4) = 116.

Combine like terms: 6x - 4 = 116.

Add 4 to both sides: 6x = 120.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 20.

So, the number of strawberry cubes is 20. 

The number of blueberry cubes is 5x - 4, which is 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

The final answer is: 96"

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the family, and each person has a flashlight. So, the number of flashlights is 4.

Next, let's find the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Half of 8 is 4, so 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, and 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each.

The number of small candles is 4 rooms * 4 candles per room = 16 small candles.
The number of medium candles is 4 rooms * 5 candles per room = 20 medium candles.

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Now, let's add the number of flashlights and candles together: 4 flashlights + 36 candles = 40.

"To find the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to add up the time it takes for each side. 

The first side takes 5 minutes. 
The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they each take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes. 
Since there are two of them, we multiply 10 by 2, which is 20 minutes. 
The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they each take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes. 
Since there are two of them, we multiply 2.5 by 2, which is 5 minutes. 

Now, we add up the time for all the sides: 5 + 20 + 5 = 30 minutes. 

The total time is 30 minutes.

"To find out how long it will take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry, we need to multiply the time it takes for one painting by 6. 

For the old varnish, it takes 7 minutes for one painting, so for 6 paintings it will take 7 x 6 = 42 minutes.

For the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes for one painting, so for 6 paintings it will take 12 x 6 = 72 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how much longer it will take for the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish. We do this by subtracting the time it takes for the old varnish to dry from the time it takes for the new varnish to dry.

72 (new varnish) - 42 (old varnish) = 30 minutes

So, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that 4 plants need half a cup of water. So, that's 4 x 0.5 = 2 cups of water for those plants.

Next, 8 plants need 1 cup of water each. So, that's 8 x 1 = 8 cups of water for those plants.

Now, we need to find out how many plants need a quarter of a cup of water. We know Crista has 20 plants in total, and 4 + 8 = 12 plants need either half a cup or 1 cup of water. So, 20 - 12 = 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water.

For those 8 plants, we need 8 x 0.25 = 2 cups of water.

Now, let's add up all the water needed: 2 cups (for the 4 plants) + 8 cups (for the 8 plants) + 2 cups (for the 8 plants) = 12 cups of water.

"To find out how long it will take Phineas to return home, we need to find out how long it will take him to cover the land part and the water part separately, and then add them together.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, Phineas will have to cover 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

For the land part, Phineas hops at 20 yards per minute. To find out how long it will take him to cover 100 yards, we can divide 100 by 20.

100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

For the water part, Phineas swims at 10 yards per minute. To find out how long it will take him to cover 100 yards, we can divide 100 by 10.

100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop. 

In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount pop, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels. 

So, in the first 60 seconds, 20 + 60 = 80 kernels pop.

In the next 30 seconds, four times the initial popping rate pop, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels. 

So, in the first 90 seconds, 80 + 80 = 160 kernels pop.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds, which is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels. 

So, in the first 120 seconds, 160 + 40 = 200 kernels pop.

After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. This is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, Elvis travels west for 5 hours at 18mph. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time: 18 * 5 = 90 miles. 

Then, he turns around and travels east for 8 hours at 18mph. Again, we multiply the speed by the time: 18 * 8 = 144 miles.

Now, we need to find the total distance he traveled. Since he went 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to subtract the distance he traveled west from the distance he traveled east: 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

So, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house now.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

First year depreciation: 30% of $9000 is 0.3 x 9000 = $2700. 
So, the value of the boat after the first year is 9000 - 2700 = $6300.

Second year depreciation: 30% of $6300 is 0.3 x 6300 = $1890. 
So, the value of the boat after the second year is 6300 - 1890 = $4410.

Third year depreciation: 20% of $4410 is 0.2 x 4410 = $882. 
So, the value of the boat after the third year is 4410 - 882 = $3528.

The final answer is: $3528"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know there are 54 red candies. 

Since there are twice as many orange candies as red candies, we multiply 54 by 2 to get the number of orange candies: 54 * 2 = 108.

Next, we know there are half as many yellow candies as red candies. To find the number of yellow candies, we divide 54 by 2: 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, we know the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies: 232 - 189 = 43.

The final answer is: 43"
"To find out how much Helen paid for the hotel, we need to multiply the cost of one night at the hotel by the number of nights she stayed. 

Cost of one night at the hotel: $80
Number of nights at the hotel: 3
Total cost for the hotel: $80 * 3 = $240

Now, let's find out how much she paid for the bus trips. We know that every bus trip was 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. 

Cost of one night at the hotel: $80
10% of $80: 0.1 * $80 = $8
Cost of one bus trip: $8

Helen rode the bus 7 times, so we multiply the cost of one bus trip by 7.

Cost of one bus trip: $8
Number of bus trips: 7
Total cost for the bus trips: $8 * 7 = $56

Now, we add the total cost of the hotel and the total cost of the bus trips to find out how much Helen paid in total.

Total cost for the hotel: $240
Total cost for the bus trips: $56
Total cost for the trip: $240 + $56 = $296

"Let's break this down step by step. 

Mazie has 52 marbles and gives them to twins, Dallas and Darla. This means the total number of marbles given to both of them is 52.

Dallas has a total of 21 marbles after dropping 4 of them. To find out how many marbles Dallas had before dropping 4, we need to add the 4 marbles he dropped back to the 21 marbles he has now. 

21 (marbles now) + 4 (marbles dropped) = 25 marbles

Since Dallas and Darla got the marbles from Mazie, the total number of marbles they both have is 52. We already know that Dallas has 25 marbles. To find out how many marbles Darla has, we need to subtract the number of marbles Dallas has from the total number of marbles given to them.

52 (total marbles given) - 25 (marbles Dallas has) = 27 marbles

So, Darla has 27 marbles.

"To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of the adult tickets, the cost of the child ticket, and the cost of the popcorns.

First, let's find the cost of the adult tickets. There are 2 adults, so 2 x $12 = $24.

Next, we need to add the cost of the child ticket. The child ticket is $8.

Now, let's add the cost of the adult tickets and the child ticket. $24 + $8 = $32.

Then, we need to add the cost of the popcorns. They bought 2 popcorns for $3 each, so 2 x $3 = $6.

Now, let's add the cost of the tickets and the popcorns. $32 + $6 = $38.

"To find the total weight of the car and the people, we need to add the weight of the car, the luggage, and the weight of the two children. 

Weight of the car = 1200 pounds
Weight of the luggage = 250 pounds
Weight of the two children = 75 pounds * 2 = 150 pounds

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Since the force needed to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we need to find 1% of 1600.

1% of 1600 = 0.01 * 1600 = 16

So, John needs to push the car with a force of 16 pounds. 

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much crepe paper James needs, we need to find the perimeter of the backyard fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is found by adding up the lengths of all its sides. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2(length + width)

In this case, the length is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet. 

Perimeter = 2(20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2(35)
Perimeter = 70

So, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to go around the fence.

"To find the average of their ages, we need to know Emma's age first. Since Mia is 40 and they are 16 years apart, we can add 16 to Mia's age to find Emma's age.

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now that we know Emma's age, we can find the average of their ages by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

"To find out how much money the company will receive, we need to know how many bars they produce in two weeks and then multiply that by the price per bar.

First, let's find out how many bars they produce in one week. Since they produce 5000 bars in one day, we multiply that by 7 (the number of days in a week).

5000 bars/day * 7 days/week = 35,000 bars/week

Now, we multiply the number of bars produced in one week by 2 to find out how many bars they produce in two weeks.

35,000 bars/week * 2 weeks = 70,000 bars

First, Jake buys 2 T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since it's a buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake will pay full price for the first T-shirt, which is $8. For the second T-shirt, he will pay 50% of the original price, which is 0.5 x $8 = $4. So, the total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, Jake buys a pair of shoes that is 40% off the original price. The original price of the shoes is $40. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by 40% (or 0.4), which is 0.4 x $40 = $16. So, the discount is $16. The price Jake pays for the shoes is the original price minus the discount, which is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store. The total is $12 + $24 = $36.

"Let's break down the information given. Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so he gathered 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes. He gathered two more Petri dishes than requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes. 

We know that the total number of items Igor had is 29. Let's say the number of beakers he had is x. Then, the total number of items is the sum of the test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes: 8 + x + 16 = 29.

Now, let's solve for x. Subtract 8 and 16 from both sides of the equation: x = 29 - 8 - 16. 

x = 5

So, Igor had 5 beakers. Since he had the correct number of beakers initially, he must have lost 7 beakers (7 - 5 = 2 more than the number of Petri dishes requested, but we know he had the correct number of beakers, so he must have lost 7).

To find the total amount they raised, we need to add these amounts together: $430 + $750 + $300 + $700 = $2180.

The final answer is: $2180"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

Since Aaron was able to run each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, if Aaron runs a mile in x minutes, Vanessa will run a mile in 2x minutes. 

We know Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes and he ran 4/2 = 2 miles (since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron). 

So, if Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, then the time it took him to run one mile is 16/2 = 8 minutes. 

Since Aaron runs a mile in 8 minutes, Vanessa will run a mile in 2 * 8 = 16 minutes. 

So, Vanessa took 16 minutes to run one mile. Since she ran 4 miles, the total time she took is 4 * 16 = 64 minutes.

The final answer is: 64"
"To find out how much line the caretaker needs, we need to know how much line is needed for 200 feet of dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply 200 feet by 3.

200 feet * 3 feet/foot = 600 feet

The caretaker already has 6 feet of line, so we need to subtract that from the total amount of line needed.

600 feet - 6 feet = 594 feet

The caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line."
"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate how much they make in one night and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

They get 6 reservations a night. Each reservation orders 2 meals that cost $5 each, so that's 2 x $5 = $10. They also order a $5 bottle of wine. So, in total, they make $10 + $5 = $15 per reservation.

Since they get 6 reservations a night, they make 6 x $15 = $90 per night.

They are open 2 days a week, so they make $90 x 2 = $180 per week.

The final answer is: $180"
"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we need to first find out the cost price of each watermelon. 

The cost price of 50 watermelons is $80. 

To find the cost price of one watermelon, we divide the total cost by the number of watermelons: 

$80 ÷ 50 = $1.60

Now, we know the cost price of one watermelon is $1.60. The vendor sold them at a 25% profit. 

To find the selling price, we need to add 25% of the cost price to the cost price. 

25% of $1.60 is 0.25 x $1.60 = $0.40

Now, we add the profit to the cost price: 

$1.60 + $0.40 = $2.00

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.00. 

The final answer is: $2.00"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know James is twice as old as Dora, and Dora will be 12 in 3 years. So, in 3 years, Dora will be 12 years old. 

To find James' current age, we need to find Dora's current age. Since Dora will be 12 in 3 years, Dora is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James is 2 * 9 = 18 years old.

We also know that James is 9 years older than John. So, John is 18 - 9 = 9 years old.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32. So, John's youngest son is 32 - 9 = 23 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 23 + 3 = 26 years old.

The final answer is: 26"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, and Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes. To find out how many oranges they can peel in an hour (60 minutes), we need to divide 60 by the time it takes each of them to peel an orange.

For Ana: 60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges
For Jane: 60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges

Now, we need to find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane. To do this, we subtract the number of oranges Jane peeled from the number of oranges Ana peeled.

20 (Ana's oranges) - 15 (Jane's oranges) = 5

So, Ana will have 5 more oranges peeled than Jane after an hour.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how much Mark paid, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the labor cost.

First, we need to find the cost of the radiator. The original price is $400, but Mark got it for 80% off. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by 80% (or 0.8). 

$400 * 0.8 = $320

So, Mark paid $320 for the radiator.

Next, we need to find the labor cost. The mechanic worked for 3 hours at $50 an hour. 

Labor cost = 3 hours * $50/hour = $150

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost to find the total amount Mark paid.

Total cost = $320 (radiator) + $150 (labor) = $470

The final answer is: $470"
"Let's say the number of chickens is C and the number of cows is 20 - C. 

Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. We can write an equation to represent the total number of legs: 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2C + 80 - 4C = 70. Combining like terms, we get -2C + 80 = 70. Subtracting 80 from both sides, we get -2C = -10. Dividing both sides by -2, we get C = 5.

So, there are 5 chickens on the farm.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, let's find the total number of slices. There are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. 

Total slices = 7 pizzas * 8 slices per pizza = 56 slices

Now, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. There are 4 people in total, including Henry and his 3 friends.

Slices per person = Total slices / Number of people
= 56 slices / 4 people
= 14 slices per person

So, each person can have 14 slices. 

The final answer is: 14"
