"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of eggs Janet has left after eating and baking, and then calculate the revenue from selling the remaining eggs.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and bakes 4 for muffins, so she uses a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs.

To find the number of eggs left, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg. To find the total revenue, we multiply the number of eggs sold by the price per egg: 9 * 2 = 18.

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of white fiber required and then add it to the amount of blue fiber.

The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 

It takes half that much white fiber, which is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.

To find the total number of bolts, we add the blue and white fiber together: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

The final answer is: 3"
"To determine the profit Josh made, we first need to calculate the increased value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

To find the increased value, we can use the formula: New Value = Original Value + (Original Value * Increase Percentage)

New Value = $80,000 + ($80,000 * 150%)
New Value = $80,000 + ($80,000 * 1.5)
New Value = $80,000 + $120,000
New Value = $200,000

Now, we need to find the total cost of the house, which is the original price plus the repairs: 
Total Cost = $80,000 + $50,000
Total Cost = $130,000

The profit is the difference between the new value and the total cost:
Profit = New Value - Total Cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

The final answer is: $70,000"
"To determine the total number of meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total number of meters he runs in a single sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he has in a week.

Since James runs 3 sprints in a session, and each sprint is 60 meters, the total meters he runs in a single session is 3 * 60 = 180 meters.

Since James runs 3 times a week, the total number of sessions he has in a week is 3. 

To find the total number of meters James runs in a week, we multiply the total meters he runs in a single session by the number of sessions he has in a week: 180 * 3 = 540 meters.

The final answer is: 540"
"To determine the total amount of feed needed for the final meal, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed given to the chickens throughout the day. 

In the morning, Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives them 25 cups of feed. The total amount of feed given so far is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per meal, and she has 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed per meal is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

However, since the total amount of feed given so far is 40 cups, we need to subtract this from the total amount of feed needed per meal to find out how much is left for the final meal. 

60 - 40 = 20 cups.

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

The final answer is: 20"
"This problem can be approached by breaking it down into two parts: the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. The remaining 15 glasses are bought at a discounted price, which is 60% of the original price. To find the cost of the remaining glasses, we need to calculate 60% of $5 and multiply it by 15.

60% of $5 is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 

Now, we multiply this by 15 to find the total cost of the remaining glasses: $3 * 15 = $45.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the first glass to the cost of the remaining glasses: $5 + $45 = $50.

The total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses is $50."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of sheep in Charleston and Toulouse. 

Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, we can calculate the number of sheep in Charleston as follows:

Charleston = 4 * Seattle
Charleston = 4 * 20
Charleston = 80

Now, we know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, we can calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse as follows:

Toulouse = 2 * Charleston
Toulouse = 2 * 80
Toulouse = 160

Now, we have the number of sheep in each city. To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:

Total sheep = Toulouse + Charleston + Seattle
Total sheep = 160 + 80 + 20
Total sheep = 260

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download the file without any interruptions. Carla can download 2 GB/minute, and the file is 200 GB. 

Time = Total size / Download speed
Time = 200 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time = 100 minutes

However, 40% of the way through the download is 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB. Carla downloads this part in 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes. 

After the restart, Carla has to download the remaining 120 GB (200 GB - 80 GB). 

Time to download the remaining part = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

The total time is the sum of the time it took to download the first 80 GB and the time it took to download the remaining 120 GB, plus the 20 minutes it took to install the updates.

Total time = 40 minutes + 60 minutes + 20 minutes
Total time = 120 minutes

The final answer is: 120"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into segments and calculate the distance covered in each segment.

1. John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. The distance covered in this segment is:
   Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

2. He then spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is covered in this segment.

3. He then drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph. The distance covered in this segment is:
   Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

4. He then drives for the remaining 1.5 hours at 80 mph. The distance covered in this segment is:
   Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles

The total distance covered is the sum of the distances covered in each segment:
Total Distance = 180 + 0 + 15 + 120 = 315 miles

However, since John is trying to get home, we need to consider the distance he has traveled from home. Since he drove for 3 hours at 60 mph to get away from home, and then drove for 4 hours to get back, we need to calculate the total distance he would have traveled if he had driven at a constant speed of 60 mph for the entire 7 hours.

Total Distance at 60 mph = 60 * 7 = 420 miles

Since John is 315 miles away from home, we need to subtract the distance he has traveled from the total distance to find the distance he is from home:
Distance from Home = Total Distance at 60 mph - Total Distance Covered
= 420 - 315
= 105 miles

The final answer is: 105"
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately, and then add them together.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, so her overtime pay rate is $10 * 1.2 = $12/hour. Her overtime earnings are:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Her total earnings for the week are:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. The number of downloads in the first month is given as 60.
2. The number of downloads in the second month is three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it is 3 * 60 = 180.
3. The number of downloads in the third month is 30% less than the downloads in the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. Then, we subtract this from 180 to get 180 - 54 = 126.
4. To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts: 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen is 3 x $68 = $204.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes: 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen is 2 x $80 = $160.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen is 6 x $55 = $330.

Finally, we add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of planting the tree and the annual expenses, and then find the point at which the total earnings from selling lemons exceed these costs.

The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. The annual expenses for watering and feeding the tree are $3. 

Each year, the tree will grow 7 lemons, which can be sold for $1.5 each, resulting in a total annual revenue of 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.

To find the break-even point, we need to calculate the total cost of the tree and the total annual expenses, and then find the point at which the total earnings from selling lemons exceed these costs.

Let's denote the number of years it takes to break even as 'n'. The total cost of the tree is $90, and the total annual expenses are $3. The total earnings from selling lemons after 'n' years will be $10.5 * n.

The break-even point can be calculated using the following equation:

Total cost = Total earnings - Total expenses

$90 = $10.5n - $3n

Combine like terms:

$90 = $7.5n

Now, divide both sides by $7.5:

n = $90 / $7.5
n = 12

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

At the green house, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners, which is x/3.

At the red house, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners.

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which is (x - x/3 - 2)/2.

We know that after selling at all three houses, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

To simplify the equation, let's first simplify the fraction (x - x/3 - 2)/2:

(x - x/3 - 2)/2 = (2x/3 - 6)/2 = x/3 - 3

Now, let's rewrite the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x/3 - 3) = 5

Combine like terms:

x - 2x/3 - 2 + x/3 - 3 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - 2x/3 - 5 = 5

To get rid of the fraction, multiply both sides by 3:

3x - 2x - 15 = 15

Combine like terms:

x - 15 = 15

Add 15 to both sides:

x = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance and jazz dance.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

The number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is the remaining students after subtracting those who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance:
16 - 4 = 12 students

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the profit, we need to calculate the potential value of each option after the market fluctuation. 

Let's denote the initial value of the jewelry as J = $5,000 and the initial value of the electronic gadgets as E = $8,000. The market fluctuation rates are 2.5% for jewelry and 1.2% for electronic gadgets.

The potential value of the jewelry after the market fluctuation can be calculated as:
J' = J + (J * 0.025) = 5000 + (5000 * 0.025) = 5000 + 125 = $5,125

The potential value of the electronic gadgets after the market fluctuation can be calculated as:
E' = E + (E * 0.012) = 8000 + (8000 * 0.012) = 8000 + 96 = $8,096

To maximize profit, the merchant should choose the option with the higher potential value. In this case, the electronic gadgets have a higher potential value, so the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets.

The profit can be calculated as the difference between the potential value and the initial value:
Profit = E' - E = 8096 - 8000 = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"This problem can be approached by considering the trains' movements as two-dimensional vectors. Let's denote the first train as A and the second train as B.

On the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. This can be represented as a vector (80, 0) for both trains, since they are moving in the same direction.

On the second day, they travel 150 miles northward. This can be represented as a vector (0, 150) for both trains, since they are moving in the same direction.

To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to add the vectors for each day. However, since the trains are moving in different directions, we need to use vector addition.

The total distance covered by train A is the sum of the vectors (80, 0) and (0, 150), which is (80, 150).

The total distance covered by train B is also the sum of the vectors (80, 0) and (0, 150), which is (80, 150).

Since the vectors are the same for both trains, the distance covered by each train is the magnitude of the vector (80, 150). The magnitude of a vector (x, y) is given by the formula sqrt(x^2 + y^2).

The magnitude of the vector (80, 150) is sqrt(80^2 + 150^2) = sqrt(6400 + 22500) = sqrt(28900) = 170.

The final answer is: 170"
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:

- Hourly wage: $20
- Hours worked per week: 35
- Weeks worked per year: 50
- Total hours worked per year: 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
- Annual earnings from teaching: 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:

- Hourly wage: $30
- Hours worked per week: 15
- Weeks worked per year: 50
- Total hours worked per year: 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
- Annual earnings from coaching: 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to get her total annual salary:

$35,000/year (teaching) + $22,500/year (coaching) = $57,500/year

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks and then convert that number to dozens.

First, let's calculate the number of days in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks is 4 x 7 = 28 days.

Since Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. To find the total number of eggs she eats in 28 days, we multiply 3 eggs per day by 28 days: 3 x 28 = 84 eggs.

Now, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12: 84 ÷ 12 = 7.

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozen eggs in 4 weeks.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total time Marissa has available to complete the remaining distance. She has already taken 2 hours to walk the first 6 miles. 

Since she wants her average speed for the entire 12-mile trail to be 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the total time she needs to complete the entire trail. 

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 mph
Total time = 3 hours

Since she has already taken 2 hours, she has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left to complete the remaining distance.

The remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we can use the formula:

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 mph

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink separately, then combine them and subtract the spilled amount.

The orange drink is two-thirds water, so the amount of water in 10 liters of orange drink is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so the amount of water in 15 liters of pineapple drink is (3/5) * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, let's combine the water from both drinks: 20/3 + 9 = 43/3 liters.

However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, which is (1/3) * 10 = 10/3 liters of water. 

To find the total water in the remaining 24 liters, we subtract the spilled water from the combined water: 43/3 - 10/3 = 33/3 = 11 liters.

The final answer is: 11"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of Raymond when Samantha is 31 years old. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we can calculate his age as follows:

Samantha's age - 6 = Raymond's age
31 - 6 = 25

So, Raymond is 25 years old when Samantha is 31. 

Now, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we need to subtract his age at the time of his son's birth from his current age:

Raymond's current age - Age at son's birth = Years since son's birth
25 - 23 = 2

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total number of DVDs sold by Billy on Tuesday, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers.

The first 3 customers buy one DVD each, so the total number of DVDs sold to them is 3 * 1 = 3.

The next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each, so the total number of DVDs sold to them is 2 * 2 = 4.

The last 3 customers don't buy any DVDs, so the total number of DVDs sold to them is 0.

To find the total number of DVDs sold, we add the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers, the next 2 customers, and subtract the number of DVDs sold to the last 3 customers (since they didn't buy any). However, since they didn't buy any, we don't need to subtract anything.

Total number of DVDs sold = 3 + 4 = 7.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time the candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. 

From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is a total of 4 hours. 

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the total hours by the rate of melting: 4 hours * 2 centimeters/hour = 8 centimeters.

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to consider the discount and the current price. Since Kyle bought the book with a 25% discount, we can set up an equation to represent this situation.

Let x be the original price of the book. The discount is 25% of the original price, which is 0.25x. The discounted price is the original price minus the discount, so we have:

x - 0.25x = 19.50

Combine like terms:

0.75x = 19.50

Now, divide both sides by 0.75 to solve for x:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cartons of ice cream Cynthia buys in 60 days and then multiply that by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, in 60 days, she will eat 60 servings of ice cream. Each carton contains 15 servings, so the number of cartons she buys is 60 / 15 = 4.

The cost per carton is $4.00, so the total cost for 4 cartons is 4 * $4.00 = $16.00.

The final numerical answer is: $16.00"
"To find the distance traveled between Henry's first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total distance of the trip is 60 miles, we can find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip by subtracting 15 miles from 60 miles. 

60 miles - 15 miles = 45 miles

Now, we know that the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the cost of the boots as B and the cost of the more expensive pair of heels as H. We are given that the cost of the less expensive pair of heels is $33. It is also stated that the less expensive pair of heels costs $33 and the more expensive pair costs twice as much, so the more expensive pair of heels costs 2 * 33 = $66.

We are also given that the two pairs of heels together cost $5 less than the boots. This can be expressed as an equation: B = H1 + H2 - 5, where H1 is the cost of the less expensive pair of heels ($33) and H2 is the cost of the more expensive pair of heels ($66).

Substituting the values of H1 and H2 into the equation, we get B = 33 + 66 - 5.

Simplifying the equation, we get B = 94.

The final answer is: 94"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given ratio and total age. Let's assume Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x, where x is a common multiplier.

Since their total age is 162, we can write the equation: 7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Darrell's and Allen's current ages. Darrell's age is 7x = 7(9) = 63, and Allen's age is 11x = 11(9) = 99.

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is: 109"
"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the total number of guesses and divide it by the number of people who made a guess.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.

The second person guesses 20 more than half of the first person's guess: 
Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 40 + 20 = 60.

The third person guesses 25% more than the first person's guess: 
25% of 80 is 0.25 * 80 = 20, and 20 more than that is 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, we add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

There are 3 people who made a guess. To find the average, we divide the total by 3: 240 / 3 = 80.

"To determine the total hours John spends taking care of dogs per week, we need to calculate the total hours spent per day and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. Since John takes care of 10 dogs, the total hours spent per day is 10 * 0.5 = 5 hours.

To find the total hours spent per week, we multiply the daily hours by 7: 5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week.

The final answer is: 35"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 's' and the number of gold coins as 'g'. We are given that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, so we can write an equation:

g = s + 30

We are also given that Gretchen has a total of 110 coins, which means the sum of silver and gold coins is 110. We can write another equation:

s + g = 110

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second one:

s + (s + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:

2s + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2s = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

s = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins by substituting 's' into the first equation:

g = s + 30
g = 40 + 30
g = 70

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Raymond has 40 jewels.
2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Half of Raymond's jewels is 40 / 2 = 20. So, Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.
3. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of points Mike scored in the second 20 minutes. Since he scored 25% more points in the second 20 minutes, we can calculate this by finding 25% of the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and adding it to the points he scored in the first 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points. 25% of 4 points is 0.25 * 4 = 1 point. 

So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

To find the total number of points Mike scored, we add the points he scored in the first 20 minutes to the points he scored in the second 20 minutes: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the cost of one yogurt. Since Terry buys 4 yogurts for $5.00, we can divide the total cost by the number of yogurts to find the cost of one yogurt.

Cost of one yogurt = Total cost / Number of yogurts
= $5.00 / 4
= $1.25

Now that we know the cost of one yogurt, we can calculate the total cost of 30 yoguruts.

Total cost = Cost of one yogurt * Number of yogurts
= $1.25 * 30
= $37.50

Therefore, Terry spends $37.50 on yogurt over 30 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total amount of money John made from selling his Lego sets. 

He sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is 13 * 15 = $195.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money John spent on video games. He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so the total amount of money he spent is 8 * 20 = $160.

Since John had $5 left after buying the video games, we can calculate the total amount of money he had before buying the video games by adding the money he spent and the money he had left: $160 + $5 = $165.

Now, we can calculate the amount of money John had before selling his Lego sets by subtracting the money he spent on video games from the total amount of money he had before buying the video games: $165 - $160 = $5.

However, this is not possible since John made $195 from selling his Lego sets. This means that John must have spent some of the money he made from selling his Lego sets on something else before buying the video games.

Since we are not given any information about what John spent the money on, we can assume that he still has all 13 Lego sets."
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the total time he spends running and the total distance he covers. 

First, let's find out how much time John spends running each day. He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. Half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours. So, he runs 1.5 hours on each of the other two days.

Total time spent running per week = 3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day) = 6 hours

Since John runs 3 days a week, we can find his average daily running time: 
Average daily running time = Total time spent running per week / Number of days = 6 hours / 3 days = 2 hours per day

Now, we know John runs 60 miles a week and 3 days a week. To find his average daily distance, we can divide the total weekly distance by the number of days:
Average daily distance = Total weekly distance / Number of days = 60 miles / 3 days = 20 miles per day

To find John's running speed, we need to divide the average daily distance by the average daily time:
Running speed = Average daily distance / Average daily time = 20 miles / 2 hours = 10 miles per hour

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine Dana's walking speed, running speed, and skipping speed. We are given that her skipping speed is 3 miles per hour, and her running speed is twice her skipping speed, so her running speed is 6 miles per hour. We are also given that her running speed is four times her walking speed, so her walking speed is 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, we need to calculate the total distance she can travel in six hours. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. 

Time spent running: 6 hours * (1/3) = 2 hours
Time spent walking: 6 hours * (2/3) = 4 hours

Distance traveled running: speed * time = 6 miles/hour * 2 hours = 12 miles
Distance traveled walking: speed * time = 1.5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 6 miles

Total distance traveled: 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles

First, we know that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. 

Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, we can calculate Ben's iPhone age by multiplying Suzy's age by 2. 
Ben's iPhone age = 2 * 1 = 2 years.

Now, we know that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. 
Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * Ben's iPhone age = 4 * 2 = 8 years.

Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance Polly can throw the javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone and then subtract the dragon's reach from that distance.

When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. Since she can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, she can throw it 3 * 400 = 1200 feet with the gemstone.

The dragon's flames reach 1000 feet. To find the distance outside the dragon's reach where Polly can still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw with the gemstone: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many calories are left in the daily calorie target. 

Daily calorie target: 2000 calories
Calories already consumed: 1800 calories
Remaining calories: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories

Since each serving of the bag of chips has 250 calories, we need to find out how many servings can be consumed within the remaining calorie limit.

Remaining calories: 200 calories
Calories per serving: 250 calories
Number of servings: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings

Since the bag has 5 servings, we can calculate the total weight of the chips that can be eaten by multiplying the number of servings by the weight of one serving. However, we need to know the weight of one serving first.

Weight of the bag: 300g
Number of servings: 5
Weight per serving: 300 / 5 = 60g per serving

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the chips that can be eaten.

Number of servings: 0.8
Weight per serving: 60g
Total weight: 0.8 * 60 = 48g

"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

First, let's calculate the total cost. Since one pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00, and Charlie makes 10 candles per pound, the cost per candle is $1.00 ($10.00 / 10 candles). 

For 20 candles, the total cost would be 20 * $1.00 = $20.00.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, so for 20 candles, the total revenue would be 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote each day and then multiply that by the time it takes to write each article (4 hours).

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. To find this, we multiply 5 by 2/5:
5 * (2/5) = 2
So, on Tuesday, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday:
7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Now, we add up the total number of articles written over the three days:
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, we multiply the total number of articles by 4:
26 * 4 = 104

The final answer is: 104"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice had at the beginning and the end, and then subtract the initial number from the final number to find out how many she used. 

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes. At the end, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining. 

The total number of Post-it notes she used can be calculated by subtracting the remaining Post-it notes from the initial number: 80 - 23 = 57.

Since Candice used 57 Post-it notes at work, and she placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 cups of coffee, we can conclude that the 57 Post-it notes were used for the cups of coffee. 

However, to find out how many Post-it notes were in the package she purchased, we need to consider that the 57 Post-it notes used at work were in addition to the 80 she initially had. 

The total number of Post-it notes she used at work and had initially is 57 + 80 = 137. 

Since she had 23 Post-it notes remaining, the total number of Post-it notes she had at the beginning and end is 137 + 23 = 160.

The number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased can be found by subtracting the initial number of Post-it notes from the total number of Post-it notes she had at the beginning and end: 160 - 80 = 80.

However, this is not the correct answer. The correct answer is actually 80 + 57 = 137 is the total number of post-it notes she had after purchasing the package, and 80 is the number of post-it notes she had before purchasing the package.  The number of post-it notes in the package is 137 - 80 = 57."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's determine the number of blue ties John bought. Since he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

Now, let's find the cost of a red tie. Since the red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, the cost of a red tie is:

Cost of a red tie = Cost of a blue tie + (50% of the cost of a blue tie)
= $40 + (0.5 * $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of a red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Finally, we can find the total amount spent on ties by adding the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"

Now, we need to find out how many pieces of 6 inches each can be cut from the wire. To do this, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece: 48 inches / 6 inches = 8.

So, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire.

"To find the total number of units in the building, we need to multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor. 

Number of floors: 15
Number of units per floor: 8

Total number of units = Number of floors * Number of units per floor
Total number of units = 15 * 8
Total number of units = 120

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total number of units to determine the number of unoccupied units.

1/4 of the total number of units = (1/4) * 120
1/4 of the total number of units = 30

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30.

"To determine how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs produced per week and then multiply that by the price per dozen.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs produced per week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of eggs produced per day by 7:

252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Since Lloyd sells eggs by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so:

1764 eggs/week / 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen/week

Now, we can multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen to find the total weekly revenue:

147 dozen/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

Therefore, Lloyd makes $294 per week on eggs.

First, let's calculate the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. Since he travels at 10 miles per hour, we can use the formula: distance = speed * time. However, we don't know the time he spends traveling from 1 to 4 PM. 

Since the question doesn't specify the exact time he spends traveling from 1 to 4 PM, we can assume it's a given time interval. However, we can calculate the time he spends traveling back. 

The distance he travels back is the same as the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Let's call this distance 'd'. The time he spends traveling back can be calculated using the formula: time = distance / speed. 

time = d / 6

However, we still need to find the distance 'd'. Since we don't have the time he spends traveling from 1 to 4 PM, we can't directly calculate 'd'. But we can express the time he spends traveling back in terms of the time he spends traveling from 1 to 4 PM.

Let's call the time he spends traveling from 1 to 4 PM 't'. Then, the distance 'd' is equal to 10t. 

Now, we can express the time he spends traveling back in terms of 't':

time = d / 6 = (10t) / 6 = (5/3)t

Since the question asks for the time he spends traveling back, we need to find the value of 't' to calculate the time he spends traveling back. However, the question doesn't provide the value of 't'. 

To solve this problem, we need more information about the time interval from 1 to 4 PM. Without this information, we can't provide a numerical answer.

However, if we assume the time interval from 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours, we can calculate the time he spends traveling back.

d = 10 * 3 = 30 miles

time = d / 6 = 30 / 6 = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * (1/4) = 7.5 pounds.

Since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, and the comic books already account for 7.5 pounds, the remaining weight that needs to be removed is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys that need to be removed to account for 7.5 pounds is 7.5 / (1/2) = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To determine which day had higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360. The revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160. The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires. The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480.

Comparing the revenues, $520 (Thursday) is greater than $480 (Friday). Therefore, Thursday had higher revenue.

To find the difference in revenue, we subtract the lower revenue from the higher revenue: $520 - $480 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of kittens each cat has had. 

Patchy, the first cat, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, which is 3 * 7 = 21 kittens.

Trixie, the other cat, has had 12 kittens.

The total number of kittens is the sum of the kittens from Patchy and Trixie, plus the 7 adopted kittens. 

Total kittens = 21 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) + 7 (adopted kittens) = 40

The Doubtfire family now has 40 kittens."
"This question seems to be a simple arithmetic problem, but let's break it down from a philosophical perspective. The concept of ""remaining lollipops"" and ""bags"" can be seen as a representation of the relationship between a set (the lollipops) and a subset (the lollipops in each bag). 

From a philosophical standpoint, we can apply the concept of set theory, specifically the concept of cardinality, to solve this problem. The initial set of lollipops is 30, and after eating 2, the new set is 30 - 2 = 28. 

Now, we need to find the number of subsets of 2 lollipops that can be formed from the remaining 28 lollipops. This is equivalent to finding the number of combinations of 2 lollipops from a set of 28, which can be calculated using the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!) where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items in each subset.

Applying the formula, we get: C(28, 2) = 28! / (2!(28-2)!) = 28! / (2!26!) = (28*27) / (2*1) = 378.

However, this calculation represents the number of possible combinations, not the number of bags that can be filled. Since each combination represents a unique subset of 2 lollipops, and each bag can contain one such subset, the number of bags that can be filled is equal to the number of combinations.

Therefore, the number of bags that Jean can fill is 378.

The final answer is: 378"
"To determine how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the total cost of each trip and divide his available budget by that cost.

Each trip to the movies costs Peter $7 for the ticket and $7 for the popcorn, so the total cost per trip is $7 + $7 = $14.

Peter has $42 available for the week. To find out how many trips he can afford, we divide his budget by the cost per trip: $42 ÷ $14 = 3.

Therefore, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week.

The final answer is: 3"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit of 5000 pounds. 

First, we need to calculate the maximum weight that the truck can carry on its own, which is the bridge's weight limit minus the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck. 

Maximum weight the truck can carry = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds.

Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we can find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded by dividing the maximum weight the truck can carry by the weight of each box.

Maximum number of boxes = Maximum weight the truck can carry / Weight of each box
= 1245 / 15
= 83

"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to follow the order of operations. 

First, we need to calculate the 25% fee on the final total of $40.00. To do this, we multiply $40.00 by 0.25 (which is the decimal equivalent of 25%). 

$40.00 * 0.25 = $10.00

Next, we add the delivery fee of $3.00 to the 25% fee of $10.00.

$10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00

Now, we add the 25% fee and the delivery fee to the original total of $40.00.

$40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip to the new total of $53.00.

$53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00.

The final answer is: $57.00"
"To determine the total number of raspberries, we need to calculate the number of raspberries in the clusters and add the number of individual fruit.

There are 6 clusters of 20 fruit each, so the total number of raspberries in the clusters is 6 * 20 = 120.

Adding the 67 individual fruit scattered across the bush, we get 120 + 67 = 187.

Therefore, the total number of raspberries is 187.

187"
"To find the number of good oranges, we first need to determine the total number of oranges that are not good. 

There is 1 bad orange, 20% of 25 oranges are unripe, and 2 are sour. 

First, let's calculate the number of unripe oranges: 
20% of 25 = 0.20 * 25 = 5 oranges.

Now, we add the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges to find the total number of oranges that are not good: 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges.

Since there are 25 oranges in total, the number of good oranges is the difference between the total number of oranges and the number of oranges that are not good: 
25 (total) - 8 (not good) = 17 oranges.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the total amount Janet paid, we need to calculate the cost of the material, the cost of the jeweler, and the insurance.

The cost of the material is $500.
The cost of the jeweler is $800.

The total cost before insurance is $500 + $800 = $1300.

Janet pays 10% of $1300 for insurance. To find 10% of $1300, we multiply $1300 by 0.1 (since 10% is the same as 0.1).

$1300 * 0.1 = $130

The total amount Janet paid is the sum of the cost before insurance and the insurance cost: $1300 + $130 = $1430.

The final answer is: $1430"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the value of the pension after 30 years and then determine the annual pension Marcy is entitled to.

Marcy works for 30 years, but she only becomes entitled to the additional 5% of the pension value after 20 years. So, for the first 20 years, she receives the standard $50,000 annual pension. 

For the remaining 10 years, she is entitled to 5% of the pension value. To calculate the value of the pension after 20 years, we can use the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r)^n

However, in this case, we are not dealing with compound interest, but rather a fixed annual increase. We can calculate the value of the pension after 20 years by simply multiplying the annual pension by 20:

$50,000 * 20 = $1,000,000

Now, we need to calculate 5% of this value for the remaining 10 years:

5% of $1,000,000 = 0.05 * $1,000,000 = $50,000

However, this is the total value for the remaining 10 years, not the annual pension. To find the annual pension, we need to divide this value by 10:

$50,000 / 10 = $5,000

Now, we need to add the standard annual pension for the first 20 years to the annual pension for the remaining 10 years:

$50,000 + $5,000 = $55,000

The final answer is: $55,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the amount Aleena paid for the first half of the year and the amount she paid for the second half of the year.

The first half of the year is 6 months, and the second half is also 6 months. 

The initial amount charged per month is $140. 

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, the company charged her 10% less than the initial amount. To find the reduced amount, we need to calculate 10% of $140 and subtract it from the initial amount.

10% of $140 = 0.1 * $140 = $14.

The reduced amount for the second half of the year is $140 - $14 = $126.

For the second half of the year, Aleena paid 6 * $126 = $756.

To find the total amount she paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to add the amount she paid for the first half and the second half.

Total amount = $840 + $756 = $1596.

"To determine how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate the car's mileage per gallon. We know that she has traveled 100 miles since the last fill-up and used 4 gallons of gas. 

First, we calculate the mileage per gallon by dividing the distance traveled by the amount of gas used: 

100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon.

Now, we know that the car's tank holds 12 gallons of gas. To find out how far Sophia can drive on a single tank, we multiply the mileage per gallon by the tank capacity:

25 miles per gallon * 12 gallons = 300 miles.

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

The final answer is: 300"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time spent watching TV and the time spent reading.

First, let's calculate the time spent watching TV. Jim spends 2 hours watching TV each time. He does this 3 times a week, so the total time spent watching TV per week is 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

Next, let's calculate the time spent reading. Jim reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is 2 / 2 = 1 hour. He reads 3 times a week, so the total time spent reading per week is 1 * 3 = 3 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total time spent on both activities per week: 6 hours (TV) + 3 hours (reading) = 9 hours.

Since Jim does this for 4 weeks, we multiply the total time spent per week by 4: 9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours.

The final answer is: 36"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of people sent by the schools. 

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players. So, the total number of players from each school is 2 * 5 = 10.

Each school also has a coach for each team, so there are 2 coaches per school.

Therefore, the total number of people sent by each school is 10 (players) + 2 (coaches) = 12.

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of people sent by all the schools is 4 * 12 = 48.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of rubies and emeralds first, and then add them to the number of diamonds to find the total number of gems.

We are given that there are 175 diamonds. The number of rubies is 35 fewer than diamonds, so the number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140.

The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so the number of emeralds is 2 * 140 = 280.

To find the total number of gems, we add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds: 175 + 140 + 280 = 595.

Number of boys = 2 * 60
Number of boys = 120

Now, we know that there are a total of 60 girls and 120 boys, making a total of 180 students. Since there are 5 students to every teacher, we can calculate the number of teachers as follows:

Number of teachers = Total number of students / Number of students per teacher
Number of teachers = 180 / 5
Number of teachers = 36

"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic equation. Let's denote the initial amount of money Bailey had as 'x'. 

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so the total amount she receives from her allowance is 5 * 8 = $40.

At the end of the 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100, which is the sum of her initial amount and the allowance she received. We can write this as an equation:

x + 40 = 100

To find the initial amount Bailey had, we need to isolate 'x' by subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation:

x = 100 - 40
x = 60

So, Bailey started with $60.

"To determine the total amount of money Tommy raises, we need to calculate the revenue from the brownies and the revenue from the cheesecakes separately and then add them together.

The revenue from the brownies is calculated by multiplying the number of brownies sold (43) by the price per brownie ($3). 

Revenue from brownies = 43 * $3 = $129

The revenue from the cheesecakes is calculated by multiplying the number of cheesecakes sold (23) by the price per cheesecake ($4).

Revenue from cheesecakes = 23 * $4 = $92

To find the total amount of money Tommy raises, we add the revenue from the brownies and the revenue from the cheesecakes.

Total revenue = Revenue from brownies + Revenue from cheesecakes
Total revenue = $129 + $92
Total revenue = $221

"To find the average square footage of a level, we need to first find the total square footage of the sandcastle and then divide it by the number of levels.

Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can start with the top level and work our way down. 

The top level has a square footage of 16. 
The second level has half the square footage of the top level, so it has 16 / 2 = 8 square footage. 
The third level has half the square footage of the second level, so it has 8 / 2 = 4 square footage. 
The fourth level has half the square footage of the third level, so it has 4 / 2 = 2 square footage.

Now, we add up the square footage of all the levels to find the total square footage:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year. 

First, let's find out how many days are in a year. There are 365 days in a year.

The puppy will eat 1 cup of dog food for the first 180 days. So, the amount of dog food used in the first 180 days is 180 cups.

The puppy will eat 2 cups of dog food for the rest of its life, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days. So, the amount of dog food used in the remaining days is 2 * 185 = 370 cups.

The total amount of dog food used in the first year is 180 + 370 = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags of dog food used in the first year is 550 / 110 = 5.

"To determine the better price, we need to calculate the cost per flower for each package option.

For the package of 3 flowers for $2.50, the cost per flower is:
$2.50 / 3 flowers = $0.8333 per flower

For the package of 2 flowers for $1, the cost per flower is:
$1 / 2 flowers = $0.50 per flower

Since $0.50 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers for $1 is the better option.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price:
18 flowers * $0.50 per flower = $9

To find the cost of buying 18 flowers at the original price, we need to determine which package option to use. Since 18 is not a multiple of 3, we'll have to buy 6 packages of 3 flowers and 3 additional flowers. The cost of 6 packages of 3 flowers is:
6 * $2.50 = $15
The cost of 3 additional flowers is:
3 * $0.8333 = $2.50

"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations. Let's denote the number of games the team lost as 'x'. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is 'x + 8'.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, which is the sum of the games won and lost. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

Since x represents the number of games lost, the number of games won is x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15.

"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her salary after the 10% increase every year for the next three years.

Initially, Sylvie's salary is $600. After five years of service, she receives a 10% increase, making her salary 600 + (600 * 0.10) = $660.

For the next year, her salary will increase by 10% of $660, which is 660 + (660 * 0.10) = $726.

For the second year after the initial five years, her salary will increase by 10% of $726, which is 726 + (726 * 0.10) = $800.20.

For the third year after the initial five years, her salary will increase by 10% of $800.20, which is 800.20 + (800.20 * 0.10) = $880.22.

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is $880.22."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as 'x'. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, the number of copies Marilyn sold is 10x.

We know that the total number of copies sold by both is 88,000. So, we can write the equation: x + 10x = 88,000.

Combining like terms, we get 11x = 88,000.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 11: x = 88,000 / 11.

x = 8,000.

The final answer is: 8000"
"To find the total number of gift bags needed, we first need to calculate the number of guests who will actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, we can find the number of guests who will attend by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of invited guests.

16 (invited guests) - (1/4) * 16 = 16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply the number of attending guests by 0.75 to find the total number of gift bags needed.

12 (attending guests) * 0.75 (gift bags per guest) = 9

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag.

9 (gift bags) * $2 (cost per gift bag) = $18

The final answer is: $18"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults and the children separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the adults. Since there are 20 adults and each adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad, the total amount needed for the adults is:

20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs

Next, let's calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the children. Since there are 5 children and each child eats half as much as an adult (5 lbs), the total amount needed for the children is:

5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs

Now, we add the amount needed for the adults and the children to get the total amount of potato salad needed:

200 lbs (adults) + 25 lbs (children) = 225 lbs

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

225"
"To solve this problem, we can start by determining the number of pets Marcia has. Since Cindy has four pets and Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

Next, we know that Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. Since Marcia has 6 pets, Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

To find the total number of pets the three have, we add the number of pets each person has: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

The final answer is: 28"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the ages of the children. 

Let's denote the age of Jackson as J, Amy as A, Corey as C, and James as M. We know that M = 10.

From the information given, we have the following equations:

1. A = J + 5 (Amy is 5 years older than Jackson)
2. A = C - 2 (Amy is 2 years younger than Corey)
3. C = M + 1 (James is 1 year younger than Corey)

We can substitute equation 3 into equation 2 to get:
A = (M + 1) - 2
A = 10 + 1 - 2
A = 9

Now that we know Amy's age, we can substitute A into equation 1 to find Jackson's age:
9 = J + 5
J = 9 - 5
J = 4

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can set up an equation:

Time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles = Time it takes Lee to run the 400-meter hurdles + 2 seconds

We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. Therefore, the time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change is:

Time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles = 38 + 2 = 40 seconds

Now, we know that Gerald's diet improved his speed by 10%. To find out how much time he saves with his improved diet, we need to calculate 10% of 40 seconds:

10% of 40 seconds = 0.1 * 40 = 4 seconds

Since Gerald's diet improved his speed by 10%, he will save 4 seconds from his original time. Therefore, the time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles with his improved diet is:

Time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles with his improved diet = Original time - Time saved
= 40 - 4
= 36 seconds

The final answer is: 36"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we are given that the number of dogs is 60. Since there are two cats for every dog, the number of cats can be calculated as follows:

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
= 2 * 60
= 120

Next, we are given that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. Let's denote the combined number of dogs and cats as D + C, where D is the number of dogs and C is the number of cats. We already know that D = 60 and C = 120.

Combined number of dogs and cats = D + C
= 60 + 120
= 180

Now, we can find the number of rabbits by subtracting 12 from the combined number of dogs and cats:

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
= 180 - 12
= 168

Finally, to find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
= 60 + 120 + 168
= 348

The final answer is: 348"
"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to determine the total number of girls and the number of girls in the girl scout.

Given that 2/5 of the students are boys, the number of boys is 2/5 * 200 = 80. 

Since the total number of students is 200, the number of girls is 200 - 80 = 120.

Now, we are given that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. So, the number of girls in the girl scout is 2/3 * 120 = 80.

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls: 120 - 80 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many hours James slept, we need to calculate 2/3 of the hours Harry slept. 

Harry slept 9 hours, so 2/3 of 9 hours is (2/3) * 9 = 6 hours.

Now, we need to find the difference between the hours Harry and James slept. Harry slept 9 hours, and James slept 6 hours. 

The difference is 9 - 6 = 3 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of tomatoes used by Freda. Since each 16-ounce can contains three tomatoes, we first need to find out how many cans of tomatoes were used to make 32 ounces of sauce.

Since the sauce loses half its volume, the original volume of tomatoes must have been double the volume of the sauce. Therefore, the original volume of tomatoes was 32 * 2 = 64 ounces.

Since each can contains 16 ounces, the number of cans used is 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes used is 4 * 3 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as x.

We know that 5 cars took an exit, so the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the original number of cars minus the number of cars that took an exit: 30 - 5 = 25.

We also know that 20 cars drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes. Therefore, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes: x + 20 = 25.

Now, we can solve for x:

x + 20 = 25
x = 25 - 20
x = 5

However, this is the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes, not the first 15 minutes. To find the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to subtract the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes from the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam: 25 - 20 = 5.

However, this is the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, but we also need to account for the 5 cars that took an exit. Since these 5 cars were part of the original 30 cars, they were not part of the 25 cars that drove through the traffic jam. Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is still 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of potted plants Mary has initially. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so the total number of potted plants she has is 2 * 40 = 80.

Yesterday, she received 18 new potted plants from the nursery, so the total number of potted plants she has now is 80 + 18 = 98.

Tomorrow, she will give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to her friends and family, so she will give away 40 potted plants.

To find out how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we need to subtract the number of potted plants she gives away from the total number of potted plants she has now. 

So, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is 98 - 40 = 58.

The final answer is: 58"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
2. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.
3. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend, who pressed the doorbell 20 times. 1/4 of 20 is 5, so the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.
4. To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to add the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell: 20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 70 (third friend) + 60 (fourth friend) = 175.

The final answer is: 175"
"To determine the total number of pages Solo needs to read, we must first calculate the total number of pages from all his textbooks. 

The total number of pages from all textbooks is 4 (Science) + 20 (Social Studies) + 7 (History) + 8 (Geography) = 39 pages.

Since Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, we need to subtract those from the total to find out how many pages are left to read. 

39 (total pages) - 15 (pages read) = 24 pages left to read.

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average per day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days.

24 (pages left) / 4 (days) = 6 pages per day.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays and weekends separately, and then add them together.

On weekdays, John drinks a glass of water with each meal, which includes breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Since there are 5 weekdays, he drinks 3 glasses of water per day for 5 days, which is 3 * 5 = 15 glasses.

On weekends, John drinks a glass of water with breakfast and lunch, but a soda with dinner. So, he drinks 2 glasses of water per day for 2 days, which is 2 * 2 = 4 glasses.

Now, we add the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays and weekends: 15 (weekdays) + 4 (weekends) = 19 glasses.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many 3-mile sections the city is divided into and then multiply that by the time it takes to cover each section.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

To find out how many 3-mile sections the city is divided into, we divide the total distance by the distance covered by the fog bank in each section: 42 miles / 3 miles per section = 14 sections.

Now, we multiply the number of sections by the time it takes to cover each section: 14 sections * 10 minutes per section = 140 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cookies Cody eats and then add it to the number of cookies Amir eats.

Since Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, and Amir eats 5 cookies, we can calculate the number of cookies Cody eats by multiplying the number of cookies Amir eats by 3.

Cody eats 3 * 5 = 15 cookies.

To find the total number of cookies both of them eat together, we add the number of cookies Cody eats to the number of cookies Amir eats.

Total cookies = 15 (Cody's cookies) + 5 (Amir's cookies) = 20

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The dimensions of the box are given as 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick. This means that the inner dimensions of the box are (5-2) inches by (6-2) inches by (4-2) inches, since 1 inch is subtracted from each side for the wall thickness.

So, the inner dimensions of the box are 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches.

The formula to calculate the volume of a rectangular prism is length x width x height. 

Inner volume of one box = 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is 3 x 24 = 72 cubic inches.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 2 episodes of a 1-hour show, which is a total of 2 hours. 

On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's denote the number of episodes as 'x'. The total time he watched on Wednesday is 30x minutes, which is equivalent to 0.5x hours.

On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is a total of 1.5 hours.

On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is a total of 2 hours.

The total time he watched TV in all is 7 hours. We can set up an equation to represent this:

2 (Monday and Tuesday) + 0.5x (Wednesday) + 1.5 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 7

Combine like terms:

2 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7

Combine the constants:

5.5 + 0.5x = 7

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

0.5x = 1.5

Divide both sides by 0.5:

x = 3

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as 'x'. Since Henry wants to make twice as many cookies this year, he plans to bake 2x cookies.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he intended, so the total number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. This can be represented as:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x = 100

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by each, we need to calculate the area of each roll-up. 

Beatrice's roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 rolls up long, so its area is 2 * 24 = 48 roll-ups. 
Marcell's roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 rolls up long, so its area is 3 * 14 = 42 roll-ups.

Since they ate their entire roll-ups, the total number of roll-ups eaten by Beatrice is 48 and by Marcell is 42.

To find the average number of roll-ups eaten, we need to add the total number of roll-ups eaten by both and divide by 2. 

Total roll-ups eaten = 48 + 42 = 90
Average roll-ups eaten = 90 / 2 = 45

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the rate at which the boat is taking on water. We are given that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. 

Since it took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can calculate the rate of rowing as follows:

Rate of rowing = Distance / Time = 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet/second

Now, we need to find the rate at which the boat is taking on water. We know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Since the rate of rowing is 1.25 feet/second, the rate of water intake can be calculated as follows:

Rate of water intake = (2 liters / 10 feet) * (1.25 feet/second) = 0.25 liters/second

Now, we need to find the total time it takes for Julia to reach the shore. We are given that the shore is 64 feet away, and we already know the rate of rowing (1.25 feet/second). 

Time to reach shore = Distance / Rate of rowing = 64 feet / 1.25 feet/second = 51.2 seconds

However, we are given that the shore is 64 seconds away, not 51.2 seconds. This seems to be a discrepancy. Let's assume the given time to reach the shore (64 seconds) is correct, and we will use it to calculate the total water intake.

Total time to reach shore = 64 seconds
Rate of water intake = 0.25 liters/second

Total water intake = Rate of water intake * Total time to reach shore
= 0.25 liters/second * 64 seconds

1800 = 7B
B = 1800 / 7
B = 257.14 (round down to 257 since we can't have a fraction of a photograph)

Now, we are given that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. This can be expressed as:

257 = 50D
D = 257 / 50
D = 5.14 (round down to 5 since we can't have a fraction of a duck)

Therefore, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is 5.

"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber and the total revenue from selling it.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber. Sasha has 10 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost $10 each, so the total cost for these boards is 10 * $10 = $100. She also has 5 4 x 4 x 10 boards that cost $16 each, so the total cost for these boards is 5 * $16 = $80. The total cost of all the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices for lumber have gone up 50% in the last few months, the new price for each 2 x 4 x 10 board is $10 * 1.5 = $15, and the new price for each 4 x 4 x 10 board is $16 * 1.5 = $24.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber. Sasha has 10 2 x 4 x 10 boards, so the total revenue from these boards is 10 * $15 = $150. She also has 5 4 x 4 x 10 boards, so the total revenue from these boards is 5 * $24 = $120. The total revenue from selling all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of ratios and proportions. The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, which means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, there are 13 cups of water. 

Let's assume the number of teaspoons of sugar used is 7x and the number of cups of water used is 13x. Since the total amount of sugar and water used is 120, we can set up the equation:

7x + 13x = 120

Combine like terms:

20x = 120

Divide both sides by 20:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar used by multiplying 7 by x:

7x = 7(6) = 42

The number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is 42.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Lylah's original salary and then calculate their salaries four years later.

Let's denote Lylah's original salary as x. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can express Adrien's original salary as 1.3x.

We are given that Adrien's original salary was $40000. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

1.3x = 40000

To find Lylah's original salary, we can divide both sides of the equation by 1.3:

x = 40000 / 1.3
x = 30769.23

Now that we know Lylah's original salary, we can find their salaries four years later. We are given that Adrien's salary increased by 40% over four years. This means his new salary is 1.4 times his original salary:

Adrien's new salary = 1.4 * 40000
Adrien's new salary = 56000

Since their salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary also increased by 40% over four years. We can find her new salary by multiplying her original salary by 1.4:

Lylah's new salary = 1.4 * 30769.23
Lylah's new salary = 43116.5222

Now, we can find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later by adding their new salaries:

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = 56000 + 43116.5222
Total salary = 99116.5222

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, let's calculate the number of hours Sadie slept on Monday. 
Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday.

For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less than Monday. 
So, for each of these two days, she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours.

Since there are two days, the total hours slept in these two days is 6 * 2 = 12 hours.

The rest of the week consists of 5 days (Tuesday to Saturday). 
In these 5 days, she slept 1 hour more than the two days before. 
So, she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours in each of these 5 days.

The total hours slept in these 5 days is 7 * 5 = 35 hours.

First, let's calculate the distance Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's calculate the remaining time after 3 hours. 
Total time = 7 hours
Time already run = 3 hours
Remaining time = Total time - Time already run
Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours
Remaining time = 4 hours

Next, let's calculate the distance Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour * 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distances run at both speeds to find the total distance.

Total distance = Distance at 10 mph + Distance at 5 mph
Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total distance = 50 miles

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand that the number of letters Jennie stamped is equal to the difference between the total number of letters needing stamps and the number of letters already stamped. Let's denote the total number of letters needing stamps as x. 

Since Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, the number of letters she stamped is x/3. 

We know that the number of letters already stamped is 30, and this is the result of Jennie's action, which is x/3. Therefore, we can set up the equation x/3 = 30.

To find the value of x, we need to multiply both sides of the equation by 3, which gives us x = 30 * 3.

x = 90

However, this is the number of letters needing stamps that Jennie stamped, not the total number of letters needing stamps. Since Jennie stamped one-third of the letters, the total number of letters needing stamps is three times the number she stamped. 

The total number of letters needing stamps is 3 * 90 = 270.

However, the question asks for the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began. We know that the number of letters already stamped is 30, and this is the result of Jennie's action, which is one-third of the letters needing stamps. 

The number of letters already stamped when Jennie began is 30 / (1/3) = 30 * 3 = 90.

However, this is not the correct answer. We know that Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, and there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This means that the number of letters already stamped when Jennie began is 30 + (1/3) * (number of letters needing stamps). 

Let's denote the number of letters needing stamps as x. The number of letters already stamped when Jennie began is 30 + (1/3) * x. We know that the number of letters already stamped after Jennie's action is 30, which is equal to 30 + (1/3) * x - (1/3) * x = 30. 

This equation is true for any value of x, so we need to use the information that Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. This means that the number of letters already stamped when Jennie began is 30 + (1/3) * (number of letters needing stamps) = 30 + (1/3) * (60) = 30 + 20 = 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Julia had 0 spoons. She bought a package of spoons, which we'll call x. Then, her husband gave her 5 more spoons. So, the total number of spoons she had after buying the package and receiving the 5 spoons from her husband is x + 5.

After using 3 spoons to sample the stew, the total number of spoons she had left is (x + 5) - 3 = x + 2.

We are told that when Julia went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons. This means that x + 2 = 12.

To find the value of x, we need to solve the equation x + 2 = 12. Subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation gives us x = 10.

Therefore, the package that Julia bought had 10 spoons.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of fish sausages Dylan bought. Since he bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, and he bought 38 chicken sausages, we can calculate the number of fish sausages as follows:

Number of fish sausages = Number of chicken sausages + 6
= 38 + 6
= 44

Now, to find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages:

Total number of sausages = Number of chicken sausages + Number of fish sausages
= 38 + 44
= 82

The final answer is: 82"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of friends Amy has. Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily has 50 friends, we can calculate Amy's number of friends by adding 20 to Lily's number of friends.

Amy's friends = Lily's friends + 20
Amy's friends = 50 + 20
Amy's friends = 70

Now, to find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we need to add their individual numbers of friends.

Total friends = Lily's friends + Amy's friends
Total friends = 50 + 70
Total friends = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of each item and then calculate the total amount Dillon will spend.

First, we know that a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs. Since each pepper costs $15, a watermelon costs 3 * $15 = $45.

Next, we know that an orange costs 5 dollars less than what a watermelon costs. So, an orange costs $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each item:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

To find the total amount Dillon will spend, we add the costs of all the items together: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

The final answer is: $880"
"To determine the hospital's profit, we need to calculate the total time spent by doctors and the total amount charged to patients, then subtract the cost from the revenue.

First, let's calculate the total time spent by doctors. Since the hospital sees 500 people a day and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, we need to convert the time to hours. 

24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours per patient.

The total time spent by doctors is 500 patients * 0.4 hours/patient = 200 hours.

The cost to the hospital is the total time spent by doctors multiplied by the doctor's hourly rate: 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

Next, let's calculate the total amount charged to patients. The hospital charges $200 per hour, and each patient is seen for 0.4 hours. 

The total amount charged to patients is 500 patients * $200/hour * 0.4 hours/patient = $40,000.

The hospital's profit is the total amount charged to patients minus the cost to the hospital: $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

The final answer is: $10,000"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps.

First, we start with 60 elves. A third of them quit after the children's mishaps, so we need to find a third of 60. 

60 / 3 = 20 elves quit.

Now, we subtract the 20 elves who quit from the original 60 to find out how many are left. 

60 - 20 = 40 elves left.

Then, 10 more elves quit after the children kick their shins. We subtract these 10 from the remaining 40.

40 - 10 = 30 elves left.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total expenditure for the two months, we need to add the expenditure in May and June. 

The expenditure in May was $500. 
The expenditure in June was $60 less than in May, so it is $500 - $60 = $440.

Now, we add the expenditures for the two months: $500 + $440 = $940.

The final answer is: $940"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of rides each person took and then multiply it by the cost of each ride.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she rode a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides. 

Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he rode a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets Pam used is 4 * 6 = 24.

The total number of tickets Fred used is 6 * 6 = 36.

To find the total number of tickets they used, we add the tickets used by Pam and Fred: 24 + 36 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down step by step. 

First, let's find out how many miles Walt walked on Tuesday. Since he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, and he walked 4 miles on Monday, we can calculate the miles walked on Tuesday as 4 * 6 = 24 miles.

Now, we know that the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. We already know that Walt walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we can subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage.

Miles walked on Wednesday = Total mileage - (Miles walked on Monday + Miles walked on Tuesday)
= 41 - (4 + 24)
= 41 - 28
= 13

"To determine the total amount Tom pays for car washes in a year, we need to calculate the monthly cost and then multiply it by 12.

Tom gets 4 car washes a month, and each car wash costs $15. 

Monthly cost = Number of car washes per month * Cost per car wash
Monthly cost = 4 * $15
Monthly cost = $60

To find the yearly cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12.

Yearly cost = Monthly cost * 12
Yearly cost = $60 * 12
Yearly cost = $720

"To determine the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items, add the delivery fee, and then add the tip.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items:

- 2 subs for $7.50 each: 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
- 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each: 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
- 2 cookies for $1.00 each: 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
- Total cost of items: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, we need to add the 20% delivery fee to the total cost of the items:

- Delivery fee: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00
- Total cost with delivery fee: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, we need to add the $5.00 tip to the total cost with the delivery fee:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of questions Mark completed in each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions in each test to find the number of questions left incomplete.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 

First, let's calculate the total number of questions Mark could have completed in 8 hours:
8 hours * 5 questions/hour = 40 questions

Since Mark completed 40 questions in 8 hours, he would have completed all the questions in the first test because 40 is less than 75. Therefore, Mark left 0 questions incomplete in the first test.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total number of questions Mark could have completed in 6 hours:
6 hours * 5 questions/hour = 30 questions

Since Mark completed 30 questions in 6 hours, he left 100 - 30 = 70 questions incomplete in the second test.

The total number of questions Mark left incomplete is 0 (from the first test) + 70 (from the second test) = 70.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of pink gumballs in terms of the number of blue gumballs. 

Let's denote the number of blue gumballs as B and the number of pink gumballs as P. We are given that there are 12 blue gumballs, so B = 12.

We are also given that there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. This can be expressed as P = 4B + 22.

Substituting the value of B, we get P = 4(12) + 22.

Now, let's calculate the value of P:
P = 4(12) + 22
P = 48 + 22
P = 70

Therefore, there are 70 pink gumballs.

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine the total number of semi-automatic cars. Since there are 20 cars in total, and 12 are automatic and 4 are manual, we can find the number of semi-automatic cars by subtracting the sum of automatic and manual cars from the total.

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the relationships between the different types of bees. Let's denote the number of baby bees as B, the number of worker bees as W, and the number of queens as Q.

We are given that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so we can write an equation:

W = 2B

We are also given that there are twice as many babies as queens, so we can write another equation:

B = 2Q

We know that the total number of bees in the hive is 700, so we can write a third equation:

W + B + Q = 700

Now we can substitute the first two equations into the third equation to solve for B:

2B + B + Q = 700
3B + Q = 700

Since B = 2Q, we can substitute this into the equation above:

3(2Q) + Q = 700
6Q + Q = 700
7Q = 700

Now we can solve for Q:

Q = 700 / 7
Q = 100

Now that we know Q, we can find B:

B = 2Q
B = 2(100)
B = 200

Finally, we can find W:

W = 2B
W = 2(200)
W = 400

"To calculate the total cost, we need to separate the food items from the non-food items and apply the 10% tax to the non-food items.

Food items: 
- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars
Total food cost: 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Non-food items:
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars
Total non-food cost: 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Since there's a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate 10% of 10 dollars:
10% of 10 = 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar

Now, we add the tax to the non-food cost:
10 + 1 = 11 dollars

The total cost of the non-food items with tax is 11 dollars.

Now, we add the total food cost and the total non-food cost (with tax):
5 + 11 = 16 dollars

"To calculate the total profit, we first need to determine the total income and total expenses. 

Kim has 3 current clients and 5 potential clients, making a total of 8 clients. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. 

Total bottles of bleach needed per week: 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed per week: 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

The cost of bleach per week: 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
The cost of cloths per week: 8 packs * $5/pack = $40

Total expenses per week: $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72

Since Kim's total income per week is $92, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total income.

Profit per week = Total income - Total expenses
Profit per week = $92 - $72
Profit per week = $20

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return. So, 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees return.
3. The number of bees that have left but not returned so far is 30 - 15 = 15 bees.
4. In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as the ones that left in the first 6 hours fly out of the hive. So, 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave.
5. The total number of bees that left but not returned before this point is 15 (from step 3) + 60 (from step 4) = 75 bees.
6. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. So, 75 bees return.

"To determine the time it takes for each person to get home, we need to calculate the time it takes for Steve and Tim to cover their respective distances.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet, as the speeds are given in feet per minute. 

1 mile = 5280 feet
Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each person to get home:

Steve's time: distance / speed = 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: distance / speed = 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will be the winner. To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to subtract the winner's time from the loser's time.

Waiting time = Tim's time - Steve's time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated and then multiply it by the cost per tire. 

First, let's calculate the total number of tires inflated. 

- 5 people on bicycles have 2 tires each, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 tires.
- 3 people on tricycles have 3 tires each, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 tires.
- 1 person on a unicycle has 1 tire.

The total number of tires inflated is 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires.

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, we need to convert the total number of tires to dollars. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so we can divide the total number of tires by 100 to get the total cost in dollars.

20 tires * 0.25 dollars per tire = 5 dollars.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Dave ate 14 french fries initially.
2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   Now, the total amount eaten by Dave and the seagull is 14 + 7 = 21 french fries.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 french fries.
   Now, the total amount eaten is 21 + 9 = 30 french fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries. Let's denote the initial number of fries as x. 
   After the seagull and pigeons ate, (x - 21) fries remained. The raccoon stole 2/3 of this amount, which is (2/3) * (x - 21).
   The remaining amount after the raccoon ate is (x - 21) - (2/3) * (x - 21).
   Simplifying this, we get (1/3) * (x - 21).
5. After the raccoon ate, ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. 
   So, the remaining amount after the raccoon ate is 5 + 1 = 6 french fries.
   Setting (1/3) * (x - 21) = 6, we can solve for x.
   Multiplying both sides by 3, we get x - 21 = 18.
   Adding 21 to both sides, we get x = 39.

- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 12 inches/baguette (since 1 foot = 12 inches) = 720 inches

Now, let's add up the total length of all the baked goods in inches: 1200 + 720 + 720 = 2640 inches

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 2640 / 12 = 220 feet

Therefore, if Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, they will be 220 feet long.

"To determine the total number of bananas needed, we must calculate the monthly consumption of all the apes and then multiply it by 2, since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months.

The monkeys need 200 bananas per month, the gorillas need 400 bananas per month, and the baboons need 100 bananas per month. 

Total monthly consumption = 200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas per month.

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we multiply the total monthly consumption by 2.

Total bananas needed for 2 months = 700 bananas/month * 2 = 1400 bananas.

"To determine the distance each person runs, we need to calculate the total distance for both Blake and Kelly.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he runs back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance for Blake is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, covering 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards each way. So, the total distance for each of her runs to the 40-yard line and back is 160 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance for Kelly is 200 + (34 * 160) = 200 + 5440 = 5640 yards.

To find out who the winner is, we compare the distances. Blake ran 3000 yards, and Kelly ran 5640 yards. Kelly is the winner.

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance: 5640 - 3000 = 2640 yards.

The final answer is: 2640"
"To determine the total amount Raphael spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

The cost of the pens is 4 * $1.5 = $6.
The cost of the notebooks is 2 * $4 = $8.
The cost of the bond paper is $20.

Now, we add the costs together: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

The final numerical answer is: $34"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial number of tadpoles Finn could see, and then subtract the number that hid under the rock.

Initially, Finn could see 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 more tadpoles came out of hiding, so the total number of tadpoles he could see is 11 + 6 = 17. However, 2 of these tadpoles then hid under a rock, so we need to subtract 2 from the total.

17 - 2 = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. On Monday, the tank has a depth of 17 feet.
2. On Tuesday, the tank has 7 feet more water, so the new depth is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.
3. On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find two-thirds of 24, we multiply 24 by 2/3.

To multiply a number by a fraction, we multiply the numerator (2) by the number and then divide by the denominator (3). 

24 * 2 = 48
48 / 3 = 16

So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

The final answer is: 16"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of each type of fish caught by Locsin and then add them up.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 

Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.

Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.

Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:

Anakin's catch: 10 (starfish) + 6 (sea horses) + 3 (clownfish) = 19 fish
Locsin's catch: 5 (starfish) + 3 (sea horses) + 5 (clownfish) = 13 fish

Total number of fish caught: 19 (Anakin's catch) + 13 (Locsin's catch) = 32 fish

The final answer is: 32"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. The price of the bag of marbles increases by 20% every two months, which means that the price at any given time t (in months) can be calculated using the formula:

P(t) = P0 * (1 + r)^t/2

where P0 is the initial price ($20), r is the rate of increase (20% or 0.2), and t is the time in months.

We want to find the price after 36 months, so we can plug in t = 36 into the formula:

P(36) = 20 * (1 + 0.2)^(36/2)
= 20 * (1.2)^18

Now, we can calculate the value of (1.2)^18:

(1.2)^18 ≈ 8.417508

Now, we multiply this value by the initial price:

P(36) ≈ 20 * 8.417508
≈ 168.34716

So, the price of a bag of marbles after 36 months would be approximately $168.35.

The final answer is: $168.35"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of the doll and the red cars, and then add up the total cost of all the toys.

We are given that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Since an action figure costs $5, the doll costs 3 * $5 = $15.

We are also given that one red car costs $4. Since there are 5 red cars, the total cost of the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

The total cost of the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, we can add up the total cost of all the toys: $15 (doll) + $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) = $50.

The total cost of all the toys is $50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference in income between the two options.

If Jackie does her taxes herself, she'll lose $35/hour in missed income for 3 hours of freelance work. So, the total amount of money she'll lose is 3 hours * $35/hour = $105.

If she hires the accountant, she'll have to pay $90, but she won't lose any income from missed freelance work.

The difference in income between the two options is $105 (lost income if she does it herself) - $90 (cost of hiring the accountant) = $15.

Therefore, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

The final answer is: $15"
"To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer accessories and subtract that from her budget.

The total cost of the computer accessories is:
- Computer: €1090
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1323

Now, we subtract the total cost from Elvira's budget:
€1500 (budget) - €1323 (total cost) = €177

Elvira will have €177 left for her clothing.

177"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many eggs Sandra needs to make 15 Spanish flans and then divide that number by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting job.

First, we calculate the total number of eggs needed for 15 Spanish flans: 15 flans * 3 eggs/flan = 45 eggs.

Since Sandra receives 9 eggs per babysitting job, we need to divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs received per job: 45 eggs / 9 eggs/job = 5 jobs.

Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times to have enough eggs to make 15 Spanish flans.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. We are given that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write an equation:

S = 2B

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This means that in 2 years, Seth's age will be S + 2 and Brooke's age will be B + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write another equation:

S + 2 + B + 2 = 28

Combine like terms:

S + B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

S + B = 24

Now we can substitute the first equation (S = 2B) into this equation:

2B + B = 24

Combine like terms:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B into the first equation (S = 2B):

S = 2(8)
S = 16

So, Seth is 16 years old.

The final answer is: 16"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the amount of money Jimmy has in relation to Ethel's amount. 

Let's denote the amount of money Ethel has as E. According to the problem, Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. This can be expressed as 2E + 2.

Given that Ethel has $8, we can substitute E with 8 in the equation 2E + 2 to find Jimmy's amount.

2E + 2 = 2(8) + 2
2E + 2 = 16 + 2
2E + 2 = 18
2E = 18 - 2
2E = 16
E = 16 / 2
E = 8

However, we need to find Jimmy's amount, which is 2E + 2. Since E is 8, we can substitute E with 8 in the equation 2E + 2.

2E + 2 = 2(8) + 2
2E + 2 = 16 + 2
2E + 2 = 18

Jimmy has $18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total miles Pancho walks in a week, considering his varying daily mileage on weekdays and weekends.

There are 7 days in a week. 5 of these days are weekdays, and 2 are weekends. 

On weekdays, Pancho walks 20 miles per day. So, the total miles walked on weekdays is 5 * 20 = 100 miles.

On weekends, Pancho walks 10 miles per day. So, the total miles walked on weekends is 2 * 10 = 20 miles.

To find the total miles walked in a week, we add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

The final answer is: 120"
"To determine the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants separately and then add them together.

The cost of the hat is given as $25.

The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so it is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. The average cost of the pants is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

The final answer is: $150"
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each group of creatures and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of legs for the spiders: 80 spiders * 8 legs per spider = 640 legs.

Next, let's calculate the total number of legs for the insects: 90 insects * 6 legs per insect = 540 legs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs for the mutant invertebrates: 3 mutant invertebrates * 10 legs per invertebrate = 30 legs.

Finally, we add the total number of legs for each group together: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs.

The final answer is: 1210"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of three birds: Sally Four (8), Granny Red (16), and Sally Two (19).

"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year, we first need to calculate her monthly payments for each debt. 

For her student loans, she pays 50% more than the minimum of $300, which is 1.5 * $300 = $450. 

For her credit card, she pays 50% more than the minimum of $200, which is 1.5 * $200 = $300.

For her mortgage, she pays 50% more than the minimum of $500, which is 1.5 * $500 = $750.

Now, we add up her monthly payments: $450 (student loans) + $300 (credit card) + $750 (mortgage) = $1500.

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply her monthly payments by 12: $1500 * 12 = $18,000.

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it takes to peel and cut all 60 potatoes. 

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes. 

Since there are 60 potatoes, the total time to peel all of them is 1.5 minutes * 60 = 90 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut one potato: 5 seconds. 

Since there are 60 potatoes, the total time to cut all of them is 5 seconds * 60 = 300 seconds.

We need to convert the time it takes to cut all the potatoes from seconds to minutes: 300 seconds / 60 = 5 minutes.

Now, we add the time it takes to peel all the potatoes and the time it takes to cut all the potatoes: 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total revenue and the total cost. 

Let's denote the number of gallons as 'g'. The total revenue is the number of glasses sold multiplied by the price per glass, which is 20g * $0.50 = $10g. 

The total cost consists of the cost of lemons and sugar. The cost of lemons is $3g and the cost of sugar is $2g. Therefore, the total cost is $5g.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $10g - $5g = $5g. We are given that the profit is $25, so we can set up the equation $5g = $25.

To find the number of gallons, we divide both sides of the equation by $5, which gives us g = $25 / $5 = 5 gallons.

Now that we know the number of gallons, we can find the cost of lemons by multiplying the number of gallons by the cost per gallon of lemons, which is $3 * 5 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of Chinese participants in the race. We know that there are 240 participants in total, and 80 of them are Japanese. So, the number of Chinese participants can be found by subtracting the number of Japanese participants from the total number of participants.

Total participants = 240
Japanese participants = 80
Chinese participants = Total participants - Japanese participants
Chinese participants = 240 - 80
Chinese participants = 160

Now that we know there are 160 Chinese participants, and we are given that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60, we can find the number of girls on the Chinese team by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of girls = Chinese participants - Number of boys
Number of girls = 160 - 60
Number of girls = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations and calculate the remaining amount after each expense.

1. Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent: 
   1/4 of 6000 = 6000 * 1/4 = 1500
   Remaining amount after rent = 6000 - 1500 = 4500

2. He spends 1/3 on car fuel:
   1/3 of 4500 = 4500 * 1/3 = 1500
   Remaining amount after car fuel = 4500 - 1500 = 3000

3. He donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity:
   Half of 3000 = 3000 * 1/2 = 1500
   Remaining amount after donation = 3000 - 1500 = 1500

4. He gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$:
   Total given to family = 200 + 700 = 900
   Remaining amount after giving to family = 1500 - 900 = 600

Therefore, Zaid will still have 600 dollars after all these expenses and donations.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, we know that Bo has 40 crabs. 

Since Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, we can calculate Monic's crabs as follows: 
Monic's crabs = Bo's crabs - 4 
Monic's crabs = 40 - 4 
Monic's crabs = 36 

Now, we know that Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic. 
Rani's crabs = Monic's crabs + 10 
Rani's crabs = 36 + 10 
Rani's crabs = 46 

To find the total number of crabs the three have together, we add the number of crabs each one has: 
Total crabs = Bo's crabs + Monic's crabs + Rani's crabs 
Total crabs = 40 + 36 + 46 
Total crabs = 122 

The final answer is: 122"
"To determine Lloyd's total earnings for the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd tutored 5 hours at $10 per hour, so his earnings for the first week are:
5 hours * $10/hour = $50

For the second week, Lloyd tutored 8 hours at $10 per hour, so his earnings for the second week are:
8 hours * $10/hour = $80

To find Lloyd's total earnings for the first two weeks, we add his earnings for each week together:
$50 (first week) + $80 (second week) = $130

The final answer is: $130"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of votes the winner received. Since the winner got 3/4 of the votes, we can calculate this as follows:

Winner's votes = (3/4) * Total votes
Winner's votes = (3/4) * 80
Winner's votes = 60

Since the total number of votes is 80, and the winner received 60 votes, the number of votes the loser received can be found by subtracting the winner's votes from the total votes:

Loser's votes = Total votes - Winner's votes
Loser's votes = 80 - 60
Loser's votes = 20

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. According to the problem, Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is 4x.

It's also given that Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. This means the number of white carnations (x) is 200 / 5 = 40.

Now that we know the number of white carnations (x) is 40, we can find the number of red roses, which is 4x = 4 * 40 = 160.

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

From point 3, we know Jan's current age is 30. 

Two years ago, Jan's age would have been 30 - 2 = 28.

From point 2, we know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 28 / 2 = 14. 

So, two years ago, Mark's age would have been 14 + 5 = 19.

Since Mark's age two years ago was 19, his current age would be 19 + 2 = 21.

From point 1, we know that Jean is two years older than Mark. Therefore, Jean's current age would be 21 + 2 = 23.

"To determine the time difference between the two teams, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 x 400 meter relay.

The well-rounded team has each member running 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are 4 members, the total time taken by the well-rounded team is 4 x 55 = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner takes 60 seconds. The subsequent runners are 3 seconds faster than the previous one, so the second runner takes 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, the third runner takes 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth runner takes 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. The total time taken by the less well-rounded team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, and then find the difference between these two probabilities.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is the probability of rolling a 4, 5, or 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5, since there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25 or 25%.

To find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 or 25%.

The final answer is: 25"
"This problem can be approached using basic arithmetic and ratios. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, we can represent the number of apples Jenna picked as x/2, where x is the number of apples her mom picked. We are given that her mom picked 20 apples, so we can set up the equation:

x = 20

Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, we can represent the number of apples Jenna picked as 20/2 = 10.

To find the total number of apples they both picked, we add the number of apples Jenna picked to the number of apples her mom picked:

Total apples = 20 (mom's apples) + 10 (Jenna's apples) = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of small rodents (rats and hamsters) and the total number of straw pieces distributed among them. 

Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'r'. Since there are 3 cages of rats, the total number of rats is 3r. 

The total number of hamsters is 10. Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw pieces distributed among hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

The total number of straw pieces distributed among small rodents (rats and hamsters) is 160. Since 50 pieces are distributed among hamsters, the remaining straw pieces distributed among rats are 160 - 50 = 110.

Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, so the total number of rats is 110 / 6 = 18.33. However, since the number of rats must be a whole number, we can infer that the number of rats in each cage is not an integer. This is a contradiction, as the problem states that the rats are kept in equal groups.

However, we can try to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 5, which is 30. This means that the number of straw pieces distributed among rats and hamsters must be a multiple of 30. Since 160 is not a multiple of 30, we can try to find the closest multiple of 30 that is greater than 160, which is 180.

If the total number of straw pieces distributed among small rodents is 180, then the number of straw pieces distributed among hamsters is 180 - 110 = 70. The number of hamsters is 70 / 5 = 14.

Now, the number of straw pieces distributed among rats is 110, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. The number of rats is 110 / 6 = 18.33. However, we can try to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 3, which is 6. This means that the number of straw pieces distributed among rats must be a multiple of 6. Since 110 is not a multiple of 6, we can try to find the closest multiple of 6 that is less than or equal to 110, which is 108.

If the total number of straw pieces distributed among rats is 108, then the number of straw pieces distributed among each rat is 108 / 3r = 6. This implies that the number of rats in each cage is 108 / 6 = 18.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the interest accrued over the 3 months and add it to the initial amount owed.

The formula for simple interest is: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

In this case, the principal (P) is $100, the rate (R) is 2% or 0.02, and the time (T) is 3 months or 0.25 years (since there are 12 months in a year).

Interest = P * R * T
= 100 * 0.02 * 0.25
= 0.5

So, the interest accrued is $0.50.

To find the total amount Mandy should pay, we add the interest to the principal:

Total Amount = Principal + Interest
= 100 + 0.5
= 100.5

Therefore, Mandy should give Benedict $100.50.

The final answer is: $100.50"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total cost incurred by the trader and the total revenue generated from selling the bags. 

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. The total cost incurred by the trader can be broken down into two parts: the cost of purchasing the bags and the cost of transportation. The cost of purchasing the bags is $20x, and the cost of transportation is $2x. Therefore, the total cost is $20x + $2x = $22x.

The total revenue generated from selling the bags is $30x, as each bag is sold at a rate of $30.

The profit made by the trader is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost, which is given as $400. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

Total Revenue - Total Cost = Profit
$30x - $22x = $400

Simplifying the equation, we get:
$8x = $400

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by $8:
x = $400 / $8
x = 50

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much they spent on food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets, and the tickets cost $20.25. So, the cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

Next, let's find out the total cost of the rides. They went on 2 rides, and each ride costs $33. So, the total cost of the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

Now, let's find the total cost of the trip. The total cost is the sum of the cost of the tickets, the cost of the food, and the cost of the rides. So, the total cost is $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we need to divide the total cost by 3. So, each of them paid $102 / 3 = $34.

"To determine the total number of peaches John collects, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends collecting peaches and then multiply that by the number of peaches he collects per minute.

Since John collects peaches for 3 hours, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, we know John collects 2 peaches per minute. To find the total number of peaches, we multiply the total minutes by the peaches collected per minute:

180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

Therefore, John collects 360 peaches.

"To determine the total amount of insects needed per day for the flock of ducks, we first need to calculate the total amount of insects needed per week for the flock. Since each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, and there are ten ducks, the total amount of insects needed per week is:

3.5 pounds/duck * 10 ducks = 35 pounds/week

Next, we need to convert the weekly amount to a daily amount. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total weekly amount by 7:

35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

Therefore, the flock of ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day to survive.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in the number of trees Tom has over the 10 years, taking into account the trees he plants, chops down, and the trees that die.

Initially, Tom has 50 trees.

Each year, he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, resulting in a net gain of 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year.

Over 10 years, the net gain would be 8 * 10 = 80 trees.

So, after 10 years, Tom would have 50 (initial trees) + 80 (net gain) = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we multiply 130 by 0.3: 130 * 0.3 = 39 trees.

Therefore, the number of trees that die is 39.

To find the number of trees Tom has left, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years: 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

The final answer is: 91"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink plastic flamingos on Sue's front yard.

On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out on Sue's front yard. This means there are now 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. Now, there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos.

The total number of flamingos on Sue's front yard is now 30 pink + 6 white = 36 flamingos.

To find out how many more pink plastic flamingos are out than white plastic flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now that we know the cost of a pen, we can calculate the cost of 8 pens:

Cost of 8 pens = 8 x Cost of a pen
Cost of 8 pens = 8 x $1.50
Cost of 8 pens = $12.00

40 restaurants * 2 pounds/restaurant = 80 pounds

Now, we subtract the amount used from the total amount available:

200 pounds (total available) - 80 pounds (used) = 120 pounds

Therefore, 120 pounds of carrots will not be used.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher as x. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we can say that x = x. 

We know that Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, so the total number of sentences for both publishers is 2x = 1000. 

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 1000 / 2 = 500.

Now, we know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, and Publisher B pays him twice that amount, which is 10 cents per sentence. 

Since Mark edits 500 sentences for each publisher, the total amount he earns from Publisher A is 500 * 5 = 2500 cents. 

The total amount he earns from Publisher B is 500 * 10 = 5000 cents.

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we add the amounts from both publishers: 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate John's total earnings for the year, taking into account the one-time monetary reward and the 5% raise in salary.

First, let's calculate the total amount John would have earned in a year without the award. Since he makes $2000 per week and works every week of the year (52 weeks), his total earnings would be:

2000 * 52 = 104,000

Now, let's calculate the 5% raise in salary. A 5% raise means his new salary will be 105% of his original salary. To find the new salary, we multiply his original salary by 1.05:

2000 * 1.05 = 2100

Since the raise is effective from the first day of the year, we need to calculate his total earnings for the year with the new salary:

2100 * 52 = 109,200

Now, let's add the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to his total earnings:

109,200 + 5000 = 114,200

However, this is not the final answer. We need to consider that the raise is effective from the first day of the year, but the award is given on the first day of the year. This means that for the first week, John would have earned his original salary of $2000, and for the remaining 51 weeks, he would have earned his new salary of $2100.

So, let's calculate his total earnings for the year:

For the first week: 2000
For the remaining 51 weeks: 2100 * 51 = 107,100
Total earnings: 2000 + 107,100 = 107,100

Now, let's add the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to his total earnings:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts. 

First, let's calculate the total number of slices Carl used for his sandwiches. He ate a sandwich every day for a week (7 days) and used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. 

Total slices for sandwiches = 7 days * 2 slices/day = 14 slices

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices Carl used for his omelets. He ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days of the week, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. 

Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet. 

Total slices for omelets = 3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices

Now, let's add the slices used for the macaroni and cheese dish. He used 8 slices for this dish.

Total slices for macaroni and cheese = 8 slices

To find the total number of slices Carl used, we need to add the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and macaroni and cheese.

Total slices = 14 slices (sandwiches) + 9 slices (omelets) + 8 slices (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices

"This question appears to be a simple arithmetic problem, but it can be approached from a philosophical perspective as well. From a philosophical standpoint, we can consider the concept of identity and change. Janet's initial state of having 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens can be seen as a static state, whereas the addition of new pens can be viewed as a dynamic change.

However, from a purely mathematical perspective, we can calculate the total number of pens Janet has after purchasing the new pens. 

First, we calculate the total number of blue pens: 6 bags * 9 pens per bag = 54 blue pens.
Then, we calculate the total number of red pens: 2 bags * 6 pens per bag = 12 red pens.
Now, we add the new pens to Janet's initial pens: 22 green pens + 10 yellow pens + 54 blue pens + 12 red pens = 98 pens.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total score Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93. Since there are six tests, we multiply 93 by 6 to get the total score: 93 * 6 = 558.

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score among the five test scores she has so far. The scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The lowest score is 71.

Now, we need to find the total score Brinley has so far, excluding the lowest score. We subtract 71 from the sum of the other four scores: 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367. Then, 367 - 71 = 296.

To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we subtract the total score she has so far (excluding the lowest score) from the total score she needs: 558 - 296 = 262.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the weight of the candied apples. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, and each chocolate bar weighs 40g, we can find the weight of a candied apple by dividing the weight of a chocolate bar by 2.

Weight of a chocolate bar = 40g
Weight of a candied apple = Weight of a chocolate bar / 2 = 40g / 2 = 20g

Now, we can find the total weight of the candied apples by multiplying the weight of a single candied apple by the number of candied apples.

Number of candied apples = 80
Weight of candied apples = Weight of a candied apple * Number of candied apples = 20g * 80 = 1600g

Next, we can find the total weight of the chocolate bars by multiplying the weight of a single chocolate bar by the number of chocolate bars.

Number of chocolate bars = 25
Weight of chocolate bars = Weight of a chocolate bar * Number of chocolate bars = 40g * 25 = 1000g

Finally, we can find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy by adding the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples.

Total weight = Weight of chocolate bars + Weight of candied apples = 1000g + 1600g = 2600g

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

To find the total number of cakes she bought after all three days, we need to add the number of cakes she bought each day: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76.

The final answer is: 76"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total cost of half a dozen plates and then find the cost of twenty dozen cups.

The cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

Since twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, we can set up the equation:

Cost of twenty dozen cups + $1200 = $36,000

To find the cost of twenty dozen cups, we subtract $1200 from $36,000:

Cost of twenty dozen cups = $36,000 - $1200
Cost of twenty dozen cups = $34,800

Now, we need to find the cost of one cup. Since there are 24 cups in a dozen, there are 24 * 20 = 480 cups in twenty dozen cups.

Cost of one cup = Cost of twenty dozen cups / 480
Cost of one cup = $34,800 / 480
Cost of one cup = $72.50

The final answer is: $72.50"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy and the total amount of money she has earned from babysitting. 

The total cost of the items is the cost of the jacket plus the cost of two pairs of shoes: $30 + 2 * $20 = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved before she started babysitting. She earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, so the total amount she earns from babysitting is 4 * $5 = $20. 

The total amount of money Sara has is the initial amount she had plus the amount she earned from babysitting: $10 + $20 = $30.

To find out how much more money Sara needs, we subtract the total amount she has from the total cost of the items: $70 - $30 = $40.

Since Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we need to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn $40. We can do this by dividing the amount she needs to earn ($40) by the amount she earns per lawn mowing ($4): $40 / $4 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We are given that w = r + 2.

We also know that each red chicken produces 3 eggs per day and each white chicken produces 5 eggs per day. The total number of eggs collected is 42. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. 

The final answer is: 4"
"To determine the time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park, as he walks around the edge. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the dimensions of the park, l = 6 miles and w = 1.5 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, the time he spends walking is the total distance divided by his speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. We know that the number of customers on the second day is 50 more than the first day, so it can be represented as x + 50.

We are given that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. This means that the sum of the customers from the first two days plus the customers on the third day equals 500. We can represent this as:

x + (x + 50) + y = 500

However, we are not given the number of customers on the third day directly. We are given the total number of customers over the first two days, which is 100 + (100 + 50) = 150. 

So, we can represent the total number of customers over the first two days as 150. We can now set up the equation as follows:

x + (x + 50) = 150

Combine like terms:

2x + 50 = 150

Subtract 50 from both sides:

2x = 100

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 50

Now that we know the number of customers on the first day, we can find the number of customers on the second day by adding 50 to x:

x + 50 = 50 + 50 = 100

Now that we know the number of customers on the first two days, we can find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the total number of customers over the first two days from the total number of customers over the three days:

500 - 150 = 350

The final answer is: 350"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, the rate of water loss for both pools is 8 gallons/minute in total. 

Over the 4 minutes, the total amount of water lost from both pools is 8 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 32 gallons.

The initial total amount of water in both pools is x + 2x = 3x gallons.

After losing 32 gallons, the total amount of water in both pools is 3x - 32 gallons.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as 'y'. Then, the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y.

We can set up the equation: 3x - 32 = y + 4y, since the total amount of water in both pools after 4 minutes is the sum of the current amounts of water in the small and big pools.

Combine like terms: 3x - 32 = 5y.

We also know that the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x, and the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y. Since the rate of water loss is the same for both pools, the difference in the amount of water in the big pool over the 4 minutes is 2x - 4y.

The amount of water lost from the big pool over the 4 minutes is the same as the amount of water lost from the small pool, which is 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons. So, 2x - 4y = 16.

Now we have two equations: 3x - 32 = 5y and 2x - 4y = 16.

We can solve the second equation for x: 2x = 16 + 4y, x = 8 + 2y.

Substitute x in the first equation: 3(8 + 2y) - 32 = 5y.

Expand and simplify: 24 + 6y - 32 = 5y.

Combine like terms: -8 = -y.

Multiply both sides by -1: y = 8.

Now that we know y, we can find the initial amount of water in the small pool, x. Since y = 8, we can substitute y in the equation x = 8 + 2y: x = 8 + 2(8) = 24.

The initial amount of water in the small pool is 24 gallons. Since the small pool lost 16 gallons over the 4 minutes, the current amount of water in the small pool is 24 - 16 = 8 gallons.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the number of hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn, which is the sum of the cost of the shoes and the belt. 

Total cost = Cost of shoes + Cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Since Lori earns $8.00 per hour, we can calculate the number of hours she needs to work by dividing the total cost by her hourly wage.

Number of hours = Total cost / Hourly wage
Number of hours = $352.00 / $8.00
Number of hours = 44

The final answer is: 44"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Janeth will pay in 12 months and then subtract that from the initial amount borrowed plus the additional 10% interest.

First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth will pay in 12 months:

$165/month * 12 months = $1980

Now, let's calculate the total amount Janeth borrowed with the additional 10% interest:

$2000 + (10% of $2000) = $2000 + $200 = $2200

Now, let's subtract the total amount Janeth will pay from the total amount she borrowed with interest:

$2200 - $1980 = $220

So, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be $220.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of dahlias and then add it to the number of roses. 

First, we know there are 4 roses in the vase. We are also told that there are 7 more dahlias than roses. To find the number of dahlias, we can add 7 to the number of roses: 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias.

Now, to find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to add the number of roses and dahlias: 4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the current ages of Adrian and Zack. 

Given that Harriet is 21 years old, and she is half the age of Zack, we can find Zack's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 2. 

Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age = 2 * 21 = 42 years.

Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, we can find Adrian's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 3.

Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age = 3 * 21 = 63 years.

Now, we need to find their ages in three years. 

Harriet's age in three years = 21 + 3 = 24 years.
Zack's age in three years = 42 + 3 = 45 years.
Adrian's age in three years = 63 + 3 = 66 years.

To find the average age of the three in three years, we need to add their ages and divide by 3.

Average age = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45 years.

"To solve this problem, we can start by identifying the points scored by each student. We know that Naomi scored 68 points. 

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. To find Yuri's score, we need to calculate half of Naomi's score and add 10. Half of 68 is 34, and 34 + 10 = 44. So, Yuri scored 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. Naomi scored 68 points, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

We know that the total points scored by the four students is 251. We have already calculated the points scored by Naomi (68), Yuri (44), and Brianna (85). To find Jojo's score, we need to subtract the points scored by the other three students from the total points.

Jojo's score = Total points - (Naomi's score + Yuri's score + Brianna's score)
Jojo's score = 251 - (68 + 44 + 85)
Jojo's score = 251 - 197
Jojo's score = 54

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of days Andrew will travel. 

First, let's determine the number of days it takes to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus and by car. 

It takes 6 days to travel by bus. 
It takes half as many days to travel by car, so it takes 6 / 2 = 3 days to travel by car.

Since Andrew plans to go to Rochester by bus and return from Rochester by car, we need to double the number of days for each mode of transportation. 

So, the total number of days to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus is 6 * 2 = 12 days. 
The total number of days to travel from Rochester to New Jersey by car is 3 * 2 = 6 days.

The total number of days for the entire trip is 12 + 6 = 18 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, there were 120 baby watermelons. After two months, 30% of them were ready for harvest. 

30% of 120 is 0.3 * 120 = 36. So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest after two months.

This means that 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons were not ready for harvest after two months.

When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready for harvest. 

3/4 of 84 is (3/4) * 84 = 63. So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many tomatoes Steve eats in a week and then divide that number by the number of tomatoes a vine can produce per week.

Since Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, we can multiply this number by 7 to find out how many tomatoes he eats in a week: 6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we can assume his girlfriend eats half as much as Steve, which is 3 tomatoes/day. Multiply this by 7 to find out how many tomatoes she eats in a week: 3 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 21 tomatoes/week.

The total number of tomatoes they eat in a week is the sum of what Steve and his girlfriend eat: 42 tomatoes/week + 21 tomatoes/week = 63 tomatoes/week.

Since a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, we can divide the total number of tomatoes they eat in a week by the number of tomatoes a vine can produce per week to find out how many vines they need: 63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/week = 21 vines.

"This problem can be approached by analyzing the process of refilling pens. Initially, Ram buys 25 pens. 

When the ink runs low, he mixes the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen. This means that for every 5 empty pens, he gets 1 new full pen. 

To find the total number of pens he gets, we need to determine how many sets of 5 empty pens he has. Since he starts with 25 pens, we can divide 25 by 5 to find the number of sets. 

25 / 5 = 5 sets

For each set of 5 empty pens, he gets 1 new full pen. So, he gets 5 new pens from the 5 sets. 

Now, he has 25 (initial pens) + 5 (new pens) = 30 pens.

However, the 5 new pens he got are made from the 5 empty pens he used. So, we need to subtract those 5 empty pens from the total count.

"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps. 

First, Johnny starts with his allowance of $20 and adds an extra $10, resulting in a total of $20 + $10 = $30.

Next, he invests this sum of money, which triples in a year. To find the new total, we multiply the initial investment by 3: $30 * 3 = $90.

Therefore, after a year, Johnny has $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of Mary and Joan based on the information given about Jessa's age. 

Since Jessa is 20 years old, and Joan is five years older than Jessa, we can calculate Joan's age as follows: 
Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5
Joan's age = 20 + 5
Joan's age = 25

Now, we know that Mary is two years younger than Joan. So, we can calculate Mary's age as follows:
Mary's age = Joan's age - 2
Mary's age = 25 - 2
Mary's age = 23

Now that we have the ages of all three girls, we can find the sum of their ages:
Sum of ages = Jessa's age + Joan's age + Mary's age
Sum of ages = 20 + 25 + 23
Sum of ages = 68

The final answer is: 68"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 1000 students in the hall.

First, 30% of the students went out through exit A. To find the number of students who went out through exit A, we calculate 30% of 1000:

30% of 1000 = 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students

So, 300 students went out through exit A, leaving 1000 - 300 = 700 students in the hall.

Next, 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B. To find the number of students who went out through exit B, we calculate 3/5 of 700:

3/5 * 700 = (3 * 700) / 5 = 2100 / 5 = 420 students

So, 420 students went out through exit B, leaving 700 - 420 = 280 students in the hall.

The rest of the students went out through exit C. Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280.

The final answer is: 280"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of candies Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert and John has 54 candies, we can set up the equation:

2x = 54, where x is the number of candies Robert has.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get:

x = 54 / 2
x = 27

So, Robert has 27 candies. 

Since James has 6 more candies than Robert, we can set up the equation:

James = Robert + 6
James = 27 + 6
James = 33

Now, we can find the difference between the number of candies John and James have:

Difference = John - James
Difference = 54 - 33
Difference = 21

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James.

The final answer is: 21"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Dolly has 2 books and Pandora has 1 book. 

Dolly will read her own 2 books and Pandora's 1 book, so Dolly will read a total of 3 books.

Pandora will read her own 1 book and Dolly's 2 books, so Pandora will read a total of 3 books.

In total, they will read 3 (Dolly's total) + 3 (Pandora's total) = 6 books.

However, this counts the books they read from each other twice. To correct this, we need to subtract the 2 books they read from each other once.

So, the total number of books they will collectively read is 6 - 2 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of letters Mike receives and responds to, and then calculate the total time he spends writing.

First, let's find out how many letters Mike receives from his remaining 3 pen pals. Since each of them sends 2 letters a week, and there are 3 of them, the total number of letters Mike receives is 2 * 3 = 6 letters per week.

Since Mike responds to each letter, he also sends 6 letters per week.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages Mike writes per week. Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages is 6 (letters received) + 6 (letters sent) = 12 pages per week.

Since Mike can write 1 page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing per week is 12 pages * 6 minutes/page = 72 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, 72 minutes / 60 = 1.2 hours.

Therefore, Mike spends 1.2 hours writing a week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1.2}$"
"To determine the number of minutes Jason has left, we need to calculate the total minutes used and subtract that from his total plan minutes.

First, let's calculate the total minutes used for the daily calls with his boss: 
15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

Next, we add the extra minutes used for calls with other people: 
450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from Jason's total plan minutes: 
1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

Jason has 250 minutes left."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Griffin had 24 fries.

Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin. So, Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which means Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Ginger gave Griffin a certain number of fries, let's call it 'x'. After this, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, after Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We are given that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27.

To find the value of 'x', we subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: x = 27 - 7.

x = 20.

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries. 

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2(2x)

Now, let's simplify the equation:

28 = 4x

To find the value of x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 28 / 4
x = 7

Since there are the same number of fish in each aquarium, the number of fish in each aquarium is 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we need to calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works. Since it takes 6 hours a day and she needs it done 4 times a week for 5 weeks, we multiply the hours per day by the number of days per week and then by the number of weeks.

6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week
24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

Next, we need to calculate the total cost before the discount. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so we multiply the total hours by the hourly rate.

120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. To calculate the discount, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage.

$30,000 * 0.10 = $3,000

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final amount Jean paid.

$30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To determine how much each person paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the party supplies and then divide that by the number of people splitting the cost.

The total cost of the party supplies is the sum of the individual costs:
$12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags) = $96

Since Isabelle and her two parents are splitting the cost evenly, there are 3 people in total. To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3:

$96 ÷ 3 = $32

Each person paid $32."
"This problem can be broken down into several steps. First, we need to determine the total weight of the onions purchased by the chef. Since the chef bought 4 bags of onions, each weighing 50 pounds, the total weight can be calculated as follows:

Total weight = Number of bags * Weight per bag
Total weight = 4 * 50
Total weight = 200 pounds

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the onions. Since a pound of onions costs $1.50, the total cost can be calculated as follows:

Total cost = Total weight * Cost per pound
Total cost = 200 * $1.50
Total cost = $300

Therefore, the chef spent $300 on onions.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cookies Sue ate on both days and then calculate the total calories she consumed. 

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 5 cookies, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 13 cookies, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

The total number of cookies Sue ate is 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.

Her sister ate a total of 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories, and her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

The difference in calories consumed is 9200 - 3600 = 5600.

The final answer is: 5600"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of girls in the school and then find the number of boys. 

First, let's find the total number of girls in the school. We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. Since there are 3 classes in total, and each class has 20 students, the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60.

However, we are not given the number of girls in the third class. We are given that the school as a whole is 50% boys and 50% girls. This means that the total number of girls in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

Since we already know that the first and second classes have 15 and 12 girls respectively, the number of girls in the third class can be found by subtracting the number of girls in the first and second classes from the total number of girls in the school. So, the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 15 - 12 = 3.

Now, we know that the total number of students in the school is 60, and the total number of girls is 30. Therefore, the total number of boys in the school is 60 - 30 = 30.

Since the third class has 20 students, and we know that the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the number of boys in the third class can be found by multiplying the total number of students in the third class by the percentage of boys in the school. However, we can also find the number of boys in the third class by subtracting the number of girls in the third class from the total number of students in the third class. 

The number of girls in the third class is 3, so the number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17.

The final answer is: 17"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of apps Travis had after deleting 9 apps. 

Initial number of apps = 61
Number of apps deleted = 9
Number of apps remaining = Initial number of apps - Number of apps deleted

= 52

Next, we need to add the number of new apps Travis downloaded.

Number of new apps downloaded = 18
Total number of apps now = Number of apps remaining + Number of new apps downloaded
= 52 + 18

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. 

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's denote the number of cougars killed today as 'x'. Then, the number of wolves killed today is 3x.

We also know that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, the number of cougars killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since we know the number of cougars killed today is 12, we can equate it to 'x' and solve for 'x':

x = 12

Now that we know the number of cougars killed today, we can find the number of wolves killed today:

Number of wolves killed today = 3x = 3 * 12 = 36

To find the total number of animals killed, we add the number of animals killed last night and today:

Total animals killed = (10 + 15) + (36 + 12)
Total animals killed = 25 + 48
Total animals killed = 73

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many times Anne went down the slide. Since Anne went down 30% less than Mitchel, we need to calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30.

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 

So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. To find out how many times Robert went down the slide, we multiply the number of times Anne went down by 4.

21 * 4 = 84

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of cows Mr. Sylas bought and then divide that number by 10 to find out how many cows each stall gets. 

Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, so the total number of cows is 10 * 20 = 200. Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, making the total number of cows 200 + 40 = 240. 

Since Mr. Sylas divides the 40 new cows equally among the 10 stalls, each stall gets 40 / 10 = 4 new cows. 

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Each stall originally had 20 cows, and now it has 20 + 4 = 24 cows. Since we are interested in 8 stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8: 24 * 8 = 192.

The final answer is: 192"

"To find the total weight of the redwood tree, we first need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections. Since the tree is 200 feet tall, we divide 200 by 10 to get the number of sections.

200 / 10 = 20 sections

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so we multiply the number of sections by the weight per section to get the total weight.

20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds

However, termites ate 30% of the wood, so we need to subtract 30% of the total weight from the total weight to find the remaining weight.

30% of 8000 pounds = 0.3 * 8000 = 2400 pounds

Now, we subtract the weight eaten by termites from the total weight.

8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of apples Andrea has as A, the number of bananas Andrea has as B, and the number of bananas Jamal has as J.

We are given that Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so we can write an equation: A = J + 8.

We are also given that Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so we can write another equation: B = (1/2)J.

Additionally, we are given that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so we can write a third equation: J = A + 4.

Now we are given that Andrea has 52 apples, so we can substitute this value into the first equation: 52 = J + 8.

Solving for J, we get J = 44.

Now that we know J, we can find A using the third equation: A = J + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48.

Now that we know A, we can find B using the second equation: B = (1/2)J = (1/2)(44) = 22.

Now that we know the number of apples and bananas Andrea has, we can find the total number of fruits: total_fruits = A + B = 52 + 22 = 74.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of cups of flour needed for both days. 

First, let's find out how many cups of flour are needed for 36 cookies. Since two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we can set up a proportion to find out how many cups are needed for 36 cookies. 

Let's assume x is the number of cups needed for 36 cookies. Since 2 cups are needed for 12 cookies, we can set up the proportion as follows:

2 cups / 12 cookies = x cups / 36 cookies

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

2 * 36 = 12x
72 = 12x
x = 72 / 12
x = 6

So, 6 cups of flour are needed to make 36 cookies.

Now, let's find out how many cups of flour are needed for 30 cookies. We can use the same proportion as before:

2 cups / 12 cookies = x cups / 30 cookies

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

2 * 30 = 12x
60 = 12x
x = 60 / 12
x = 5

So, 5 cups of flour are needed to make 30 cookies.

Now, we need to find the total number of cups of flour needed for both days. We add the number of cups needed for 36 cookies and 30 cookies:

Total cups of flour = 6 cups + 5 cups
Total cups of flour = 11 cups

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two-thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to first calculate two-thirds of 9,300 pennies.

Two-thirds of 9,300 can be calculated as (2/3) * 9,300.

To simplify this, we can multiply 9,300 by 2 and then divide by 3.

9,300 * 2 = 18,600

Now, we divide 18,600 by 3:

18,600 / 3 = 6,200

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount:

6,200 * 0.01 = $62

The total dollar amount in a stack that contains two-thirds of the pennies in the cup is $62.

"This question can be approached from a mathematical perspective, which is a fundamental aspect of epistemology, the branch of philosophy that deals with the nature, sources, and limits of knowledge. In this case, we can use basic arithmetic to solve the problem.

First, we need to calculate the total number of marbles Maddison initially has. Since she has 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each box, we can multiply the number of boxes by the number of marbles in each box:

5 boxes * 50 marbles/box = 250 marbles

Next, we need to add the 20 marbles she received from her friend to the total number of marbles she already has:

250 marbles + 20 marbles = 270 marbles

Therefore, Maddison now has 270 marbles.

270"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of trees in each yard and then find the difference between Harry's and Ferdinand's yards.

Chris has 6 trees. 
Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, so Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.

Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has is 2 * 3 = 6. 5 more than that is 6 + 5 = 11.

To find the difference between Harry's and Ferdinand's yards, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard: 11 - 3 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of money each girl has and then add them together.

Carmen has $100.
Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.

"To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then add them to the selling price.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500.

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

The total price of the house is the sum of the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

To find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price: $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

The final answer is: $9,500"
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid in fees and subtract that from the selling price, then subtract the remaining loan amount.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 is 0.03 x $400,000 = $12,000.

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 is 0.05 x $400,000 = $20,000.

The total amount paid in fees is $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

Now, let's subtract the total fees from the selling price: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000.

Finally, let's subtract the remaining loan amount: $368,000 - $250,000 = $118,000.

Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how long it takes to heat the oil to 400 degrees. Since it takes 40% longer than 20 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees, we need to calculate 40% of 20 minutes and add it to 20 minutes.

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. 

So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat the oil to 400 degrees.

Now, we know that after warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. Since it took 28 minutes to warm up the oil, it will take 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is the sum of the time it took to warm up the oil and the time it took to cook. 

Total time = 28 minutes (to warm up the oil) + 23 minutes (to cook) = 51 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, we know that the juggler can juggle 16 balls. 

Next, we are told that half of the balls are golf balls. This means that the number of golf balls is 16 / 2 = 8.

Then, we are told that half of the golf balls are blue. This means that the number of blue golf balls is 8 / 2 = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 blue golf balls.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then add them together.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

To find the total number of M&Ms, we add the number of M&Ms in each bag together: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of windows in one house and then multiply it by the number of houses.

First, let's calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house. Each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows. So, the total number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is 3 * 2 = 6.

Next, there are 4 additional windows in each house not connected to bedrooms. So, the total number of windows in one house is 6 (from the bedrooms) + 4 (additional windows) = 10.

Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows between the houses is 2 * 10 = 20.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, let's find the number of stitches in the collar. The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches in the body, which is 900. So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

Next, we know the rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar. Therefore, the rosette takes 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know the total number of stitches in the sweater is 1800. We have already accounted for the body (900 stitches), the collar (90 stitches), and the rosette (180 stitches). So, the total number of stitches accounted for so far is 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170.

To find the number of stitches in each sleeve, we need to subtract the total number of stitches accounted for from the total number of stitches in the sweater. This gives us 1800 - 1170 = 630.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the remaining stitches by 2 to find the number of stitches in each sleeve. Therefore, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the number of lines in the first scene. We know that the solo song has 54 lines, and the first scene has twice the number of lines, but only a third of them are Sean's lines. This means the first scene has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. Since only a third of these lines are Sean's, he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

Next, let's find the number of lines in the second scene. We know that the second scene has six more lines than the song, which has 54 lines. So, the second scene has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Since four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, he has (4/5) * 60 = 48 lines from the second scene.

Now, let's add up the total number of lines Sean has to memorize. He has 36 lines from the first scene, 48 lines from the second scene, and 54 lines from the solo song. So, the total number of lines Sean has to memorize is 36 + 48 + 54 = 138.

"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to calculate the number of cards that do not have the letter A, B, or C on them.

First, let's find the number of cards with the letter A: 2/5 of 80 is (2/5) * 80 = 32.

Now, we subtract the number of cards with A from the total: 80 - 32 = 48.

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B: 1/2 of the remaining 48 is (1/2) * 48 = 24.

Now, we subtract the number of cards with B from the remaining 48: 48 - 24 = 24.

Then, we find the number of cards with the letter C: 5/8 of the remaining 24 is (5/8) * 24 = 15.

Now, we subtract the number of cards with C from the remaining 24: 24 - 15 = 9.

Therefore, the number of cards with the letter D is 9.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it takes to dig the small holes and the total time it takes to dig the large holes, and then add these two times together.

First, let's calculate the total time to dig the small holes. Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig one small hole, so to dig 30 small holes, it will take him 30 x 3 = 90 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the total time to dig the large holes. Matthew takes 10 minutes to dig one large hole, so to dig 15 large holes, it will take him 15 x 10 = 150 minutes.

Now, we add the total time for the small holes and the total time for the large holes: 90 + 150 = 240 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 240 / 60 = 4 hours.

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

"This problem can be approached using basic arithmetic and algebra. Let's denote Mico's current age as 'M' and Marco's current age as 'm'. We are given that M + m = 20.

To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to add 10 to each of their current ages and then sum the results. This can be expressed as (M + 10) + (m + 10).

Since M + m = 20, we can substitute this into the expression (M + 10) + (m + 10) to get (20 + 10) + (20 + 10).

Simplifying this, we get 30 + 30 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S.

From the first statement, we know that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so we can write an equation:

R = 6S

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9, and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the second statement, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write another equation:

R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now, let's simplify the second equation:

R + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:

R = 3S + 18

Now we have two equations:

R = 6S
R = 3S + 18

Since both equations are equal to R, we can set them equal to each other:

6S = 3S + 18

Subtract 3S from both sides:

3S = 18

Divide both sides by 3:

S = 6

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of spots on the cobras and the total number of spots on the mambas. 

Since the cobra has twice as many spots as the mamba, let's denote the number of spots on the mamba as 'x'. Then, the number of spots on the cobra is 2x. We are given that the cobra has 70 spots, so 2x = 70. 

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 70 / 2 = 35. 

Now that we know the mamba has 35 spots, we can find the total number of spots on the mambas: 60 mambas * 35 spots/mamba = 2100 spots.

Next, we find the total number of spots on the cobras: 40 cobras * 70 spots/cobra = 2800 spots.

The total number of spots on both snakes is 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

Half the number of spots they all have combined is 4900 / 2 = 2450.

"To determine the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we need to calculate the total space occupied by the topaz gemstones and subtract it from the total length of the necklace. 

Each topaz gemstone is one inch long, and there are 8 gemstones per necklace. So, the total space occupied by the gemstones is 8 inches. 

The remaining space for the sterling silver beads is 25 inches (total length of the necklace) - 8 inches (space occupied by gemstones) = 17 inches.

Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, so the number of beads that can fit in 17 inches is 17 / (1/4) = 17 / 0.25 = 68.

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since it's traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, we can calculate its speed as follows:

Speed of the car in the fast lane = 60 miles/hour
Speed of the car in the slow lane = 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour

Now, we know that both cars cover the same distance, which is 480 miles. We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

For the car in the fast lane:
Time = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours

Since the car in the slow lane travels at half the speed, it will take twice as long to cover the same distance. Therefore, the time taken by the car in the slow lane is:

Time = 2 * 8 hours = 16 hours

Now, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars: 40 - 24 = 16.

Since there are 8 children, and the remaining chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them, we can find out how many chocolate bars each child will get by dividing the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children: 16 / 8 = 2.

Therefore, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Susan works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

First, let's find the total time she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

3 hours (working time) - 0.5 hours (pause time) = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the total working time to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:

150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 per interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval:

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

Therefore, Susan earns $75 for the online task.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the points each player has after the third round and then calculate the extra points they receive in the fourth round.

After the third round, Mike has 21 points. Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points. Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

Now, let's calculate the extra points each player receives in the fourth round. Mike has 21 points, which is not over 20, so he doesn't receive an extra point. Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he also doesn't receive an extra point. Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he receives an extra point.

Now, let's calculate the total points each player has after the fourth round. Mike still has 21 points. Jim still has 18 points. Tony has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

The total points of all three players after the fourth round is 21 + 18 + 43 = 82.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then divide the total amount of rice available by this daily consumption.

First, let's calculate the daily consumption of rice per person. Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 3 meals per day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). So, the daily consumption per person is 0.2 kg/meal * 3 meals = 0.6 kg/day.

Since there are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, but not breakfast, we will only consider lunch and dinner. So, the total daily consumption for these 5 members is 0.6 kg/day * 5 members = 3 kg/day.

Now, we need to calculate how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. To do this, we divide the total amount of rice available (42 kg) by the daily consumption (3 kg/day).

42 kg / 3 kg/day = 14 days

Since we want to know how many weeks the rice will last, we need to convert the number of days to weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the number of days by 7.

14 days / 7 days/week = 2 weeks

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 2 weeks.

- Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates.
- On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
- On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
- On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.

Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65

Since Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, he had two days off. A week has 7 days, so the number of days he was open is 7 - 2 = 5.

His target for the week is 120 crates, and he was open for 5 days. 

Target per day = 120 / 7 = 17.14 (approximately)

Since he was open for 5 days, his target for those 5 days is 17.14 * 5 = 85.7

However, he only sold 65 crates. 

To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the total crates sold from the target for those 5 days.

Crates off from target = 85.7 - 65 = 20.7

So, Sam was approximately 20.7 crates off from his target for the week. 

The final answer is: 20.7"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of bids made by Carmen and the last bid she made. 

Since there are 3 other people who bid once, and Carmen bids after each of them, the total number of bids made by the other 3 people is 3. Therefore, the total number of bids made by Carmen is 3 (by the other people) + 1 (her initial bid) + 3 (her bids after each of the other people) = 7.

The bids rise by $50 each time, so the sequence of bids is: $200, $250, $300, $350, $400, $450, $500.

Carmen wins the desk with the last bid, which is $500.

The final answer is: $500"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total miles driven per year, the total cost of driving per year, and then add the bonus.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven per year. Since John goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, he makes a total of 5 * 50 = 250 trips per year. Each trip is 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home, so the total miles driven per trip is 30 + 30 = 60 miles. Therefore, the total miles driven per year is 250 * 60 = 15,000 miles.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of driving per year. John is charged $2 per mile driven, so the total cost of driving per year is 15,000 * $2 = $30,000.

Finally, let's calculate the total bonus per year. John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month, and there are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus per year is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

The total amount John pays per year for driving is the sum of the total cost of driving and the total bonus, which is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The final answer is: $31,800"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total amount of time Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday. 

On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes. 
On Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes. 

Total time exercised on Monday and Sunday = 23 + 16 = 39 minutes.

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the total time by 2.

Total time Peter wants to exercise on Tuesday = 2 * 39 = 78 minutes.

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

The final answer is: 78"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the process of folding and unfolding the paper. When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two layers: the front and the back. 

In a 32-page tabloid, we have 32 pages in total. When folded, the paper is divided into two layers: the left and the right sides. 

Since each page is printed on both sides, we can consider each page as two separate pages: one for the front and one for the back. However, when folded, the back of one page becomes the front of the next page. 

So, for the first 16 pages (pages 1-16), we have 16 pages on the left side (left front and left back) and 16 pages on the right side (right front and right back). 

However, for the last 16 pages (pages 17-32), the back of page 16 becomes the front of page 17, and so on. This means that the last 16 pages are actually printed on the same piece of paper as the first 16 pages, but on the other side.

Therefore, we need 1 piece of paper for the first 16 pages and another piece of paper for the last 16 pages. 

The final answer is: 2"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. First, Annika spent half of her money on food and snacks. Since she had $50 initially, half of that would be 50 / 2 = 25 dollars. 

After spending $25 on food and snacks, she had 50 - 25 = 25 dollars left. Then, she spent an additional $10 on rides. So, we subtract 10 from 25 to find out how much money she has left: 25 - 10 = 15 dollars.

The final answer is: $15"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many books Elise sold in the first year. We know that she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, and this year she sold 45 books. 

Let's denote the number of books sold in the current year as x. Then, the number of books sold in the first year is 2x. 

We also know that there are 50 unsold books, and the total number of books is 250. So, the total number of books sold is 250 - 50 = 200. 

We can set up the equation: x + 2x = 200, where x is the number of books sold in the current year. 

Solving for x, we get 3x = 200, and x = 200 / 3 = 66.67. However, since we cannot sell a fraction of a book, we can assume that Elise sold 67 books in the current year (rounding up from 66.67).

Now, we know that Elise sold 2x = 2 * 67 = 134 books in the first year.

The total amount of money she earned in the first year is 134 * 20 = 2680 dollars.

The total amount of money she earned in the second year is 45 * 20 = 900 dollars.

The final answer is: $900"
"To determine how much money Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week: 10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week.

Since Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are: 50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week.

In a month like April, which has 4 weeks, Watson's total earnings from his hourly wage would be: $500/week * 4 weeks = $2000.

Additionally, Watson receives a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. Since the company performed well for the whole month, he would receive a bonus for 4 weeks: $300/week * 4 weeks = $1200.

To find Watson's total earnings for the month, we add his earnings from his hourly wage and the bonus: $2000 + $1200 = $3200.

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April.

The final answer is: $3200"
"To find out how many people John lost to, we need to calculate 20% of 20, since 80% of the people he beat. 

20% of 20 is calculated as 0.2 * 20 = 4.

So, John lost to 4 people. 

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.
2. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 
   To find out how many loaves are sold in the morning, we need to calculate two-thirds of 60.
   Two-thirds of 60 = (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves.

3. Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales.
   Total loaves - loaves sold in the morning = 60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

4. Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening.
   To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we need to calculate half of the remaining loaves.
   Half of 20 = 20 / 2 = 10 loaves.

So, 10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which Joey loses weight and then apply that rate to Sandy's situation.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find the rate at which Joey loses weight, we divide the weight lost by the number of weeks: 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we can multiply the number of weeks it takes Joey to lose the weight by 4: 4 weeks * 4 = 16 weeks.

Therefore, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week.

The final answer is: 16"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before and after the discount, and then find the difference.

The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream at the original price is 2 x $13 = $26. 

The cost of 4 packets of milk at the original price is 4 x $1 = $4.

The total cost of the items before the discount is $26 + $4 = $30.

The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream at the discounted price is 2 x $11 = $22.

The cost of 4 packets of milk at the discounted price is 4 x ($1 - $0.5) = 4 x $0.5 = $2.

The total cost of the items after the discount is $22 + $2 = $24.

The amount saved is the difference between the total cost before and after the discount, which is $30 - $24 = $6.

The final numerical answer is: $6"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of new arms and legs grown by the person after 15 days.

The person grows an extra arm every 3 days. To find out how many arms they will grow in 15 days, we divide 15 by 3. 

15 / 3 = 5

So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

The person grows an extra leg every 5 days. To find out how many legs they will grow in 15 days, we divide 15 by 5.

15 / 5 = 3

So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

In total, the person will grow 5 extra arms and 3 extra legs, making a total of 8 new limbs.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. Calculate the cost of the business suits: 
6 suits * $100 per suit = $600

2. Calculate the cost of the suitcases: 
3 suitcases * $50 per suitcase = $150

3. Calculate the cost of the flight ticket: 
The cost of a business suit is $100. Five times this amount is 5 * $100 = $500. The flight ticket costs $700 more than this, so the cost of the flight ticket is $500 + $700 = $1200.

4. Calculate the total cost of the business suits, suitcases, and flight ticket: 
$600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950

5. Calculate the total amount Theo has spent so far: 
$6000 (initial amount) - $1950 (total spent) = $4050

6. Calculate the amount Theo has left after saving $2000: 
$4050 (amount left) - $2000 (amount saved) = $2050

7. The amount left is the amount Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a day and then multiply it by 7 to get the total number of eggs consumed in a week.

First, let's find out how many people eat 3 eggs each day and how many people eat 2 eggs each day. 

There are 5 people in the family, and 3 people eat 3 eggs each day. So, the number of people eating 3 eggs each day is 3. The remaining people eat 2 eggs each day, which is 5 - 3 = 2 people.

Now, let's calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a day. 

The 3 people eating 3 eggs each day will consume 3 * 3 = 9 eggs. The 2 people eating 2 eggs each day will consume 2 * 2 = 4 eggs. 

So, the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a day is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7. 

13 eggs/day * 7 days = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: 91"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given to establish a relationship between the ages of Trent, Jane, and Quinn.

We know that Quinn is 30 years old. 

Since Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, we can calculate Jane's age by subtracting 3 from Quinn's age: 30 - 3 = 27.

Now, we know that Trent is 5 years older than Jane. To find Trent's age, we can add 5 to Jane's age: 27 + 5 = 32.

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old.

The final answer is: 32"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find Noah's current age. Since Cera is 46 years old now, six years ago, Cera was 40 years old. We are told that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah's age six years ago was 40 / 2 = 20 years old. 

Now, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, the population of Chile six years ago was 20 * 3000 = 60,000.

We are also told that the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now. Therefore, the current population of Chile is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

The final answer is: 120,000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is D/2.

We know that the total number of players on the team is 105. Therefore, the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams is equal to 105:

2D + D + D/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, we can multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

4D + 2D + D = 210

Combine like terms:

7D = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7 to solve for D:

D = 210 / 7
D = 30

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of people invited and then subtract the number of people who couldn't come.

Martha invited 2 families with 6 people, so that's 2 * 6 = 12 people. She also invited 3 families with 4 people, so that's 3 * 4 = 12 people. The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. This means that 8 people are subtracted from the total number of people invited. So, 24 - 8 = 16.

Now, 1/4 of the people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments. 1/4 of 8 is 2, so 2 people had previous commitments. We need to subtract these 2 people from the remaining number of people who could come. So, 16 - 2 = 14.

Therefore, 14 people show up for Martha's party.

The final answer is: 14"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that already had 50 marbles. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

Next, Solomon's father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, his father gave him 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now, we add the marbles given by Solomon's father to the total number of marbles in the store: 70 + 8 = 78.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble to find the total weight: 78 * 2 = 156.

The final answer is: 156"
"To find the cost of filling the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as the pool) is length x width x height.

Given dimensions: 
- Length (L) = 6 feet
- Width (W) = 4 feet
- Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume (V) = L x W x H = 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet

Now, we need to find the cost of filling the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot.

Cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot
= 120 cubic feet x $0.1/cubic foot
= $12

The final answer is: $12"
"To solve this problem, we can start by identifying the number of girls and nongendered children in the classroom.

Since there are 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.

The number of nongendered children is 1/10 as many as the number of boys, so it is 1/10 * 30 = 3.

To find the total number of children, we need to add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children together: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

The final answer is: 123"
"To solve this problem, we can use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Let's denote the number of electric poles as 'x'. According to the given ratio, the number of electric wires would be 3x.

We are given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

3x = 45

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required by the electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of people who left the party. We know that 1/4 of the total number of people left, and we also know that 22 men stayed at the party. 

Let's start by finding the total number of people who left. Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, 3/4 of the people stayed. We can set up an equation to represent this:

(3/4) * (total number of people) = 22 (men who stayed) + x (women who stayed)

We know that the total number of people at the beginning was 25 men + 15 women = 40 people. 

We can substitute this into the equation:

(3/4) * 40 = 22 + x

First, we multiply 3/4 by 40:

(3/4) * 40 = 30

Now we have:

30 = 22 + x

To find x, we subtract 22 from both sides:

x = 30 - 22
x = 8

So, 8 women stayed at the party.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, we know that the book costs $4. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, we can calculate the cost of the magazine by dividing the cost of the book by 2.

Cost of magazine = Cost of book / 2
Cost of magazine = $4 / 2
Cost of magazine = $2

Next, we are told that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. To find the cost of the pen, we subtract $1 from the cost of the magazine.

Cost of pen = Cost of magazine - $1
Cost of pen = $2 - $1
Cost of pen = $1

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of pencils Jam has. We know she has 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils, and together they amount to 26 pencils. 

Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as 'x'. Since Jam has 3 boxes, the total number of pencils in the boxes is 3x. Adding the 2 loose pencils, we get the equation: 3x + 2 = 26.

To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate it. Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: 3x = 26 - 2, which simplifies to 3x = 24.

Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for 'x': x = 24 / 3, which simplifies to x = 8.

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Now, we know Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each, which amounts to 3 * 8 = 24 pencils. Adding the 2 loose pencils, Jam has a total of 24 + 2 = 26 pencils.

Meg has 46 pencils. To find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have, we add their pencils together: 26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72 pencils.

Since each box contains 8 pencils, we need to divide the total number of pencils by 8 to find the number of boxes needed: 72 / 8 = 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, let's determine how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can divide 65 by 13 to find the number of ice cubes needed: 65 / 13 = 5 ice cubes.

Next, we need to find out how much the coffee is weakened by the ice cubes. Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, 5 ice cubes will make it 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Now, let's consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. Since any added liquid weakens the coffee, the total weakening effect of the cream is 15 milliliters.

To find the total weakening effect, we add the weakening effect of the ice cubes and the cream: 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple ratio-based approach. Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, the ratio of old records to new records is 2:1.

Let's denote the number of old records brought in by the 5 people as 'x'. Since 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can set up the following equation based on the ratio:

2x / 1 = 7 (since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, and 5 people get 7 new records in total)

To find the value of 'x', we can multiply both sides of the equation by 1 and then divide by 2:

x = 7 * 2
x = 14

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records. 

The final answer is: 14"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of junior programmers and the number of senior programmers. 

The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 100. So, the number of junior programmers is 2/5 * 100 = 40.

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60.

The junior programmers are each paid $2000 per month, so the total amount paid to junior programmers is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so they are paid $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

The total amount paid to senior programmers is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

The total amount paid to all programmers is the sum of the amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers, which is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

The final answer is: $224,000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as 'x'. 

Initially, there were 'x' people on the bus. 

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total number of people became x + 5.

At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the number of people became (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2.

Then, 8 more people got in, so the total number of people became (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6.

We are given that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20. Therefore, we can set up the equation x + 6 = 20.

To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation:

x + 6 - 6 = 20 - 6
x = 14

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time it takes to charge the phone from 60% to 100%. 

First, let's find out how many percentage points the phone needs to charge to reach 100% from 60%. Since it's already at 60%, it needs to charge 100% - 60% = 40% more.

Now, we know that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. To find out how long it takes to charge 40%, we multiply the rate by the amount to be charged: 40 * 3 = 120 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 120 / 60 = 2 hours.

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%.

Then, her mother gives her 10 more, so we add 7 + 10 = 17. After that, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella, so we subtract 3 from 17, which gives us 17 - 3 = 14.

The final number of lollipops Erin has left is 14."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's determine the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 they spent, they get a $1 reward. So, the number of rewards they earned is $80 / $20 = 4 rewards.

Since they used their rewards on this shopping trip, we need to subtract the value of the rewards from their total spending. The value of the rewards is 4 * $1 = $4.

Now, let's calculate the price after applying the rewards: $43 - $4 = $39.

Next, the customer applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. The amount of rewards is $4, so the coupon took 2 * $4 = $8 off the price.

Now, let's calculate the final price after applying the coupon: $39 - $8 = $31.

The customer paid $31 on this shopping trip.

"To determine which job offers a higher net pay, we need to calculate the net income for each job.

For Job A, the total income is $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year. The total tax paid is 20% of $30,000, which is 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000. Therefore, the net income for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

For Job B, the total income is $42,000. The property tax is $6,000, and the net income after property tax is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. The tax paid is 10% of $36,000, which is 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600. Therefore, the net income for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

Since $32,400 is greater than $24,000, Job B offers a higher net pay rate.

To find the difference in net pay between the two jobs, we subtract the net income of Job A from the net income of Job B: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400"

Now, we know that half of the ruined castles are unmanned. To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we divide the total number of ruined castles by 2:
88 / 2 = 44

The final answer is: 44"
"To determine the cost difference between the two offers, we need to calculate the total cost of each offer and then subtract one from the other.

Furniture United's offer includes a $1,350 advance payment and 6 monthly installments of $350 each. The total cost of the installments is 6 * $350 = $2,100. Adding the advance payment, the total cost of Furniture United's offer is $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450.

Cozy Homes' offer includes a $1,100 advance payment and 9 monthly installments of $250 each. The total cost of the installments is 9 * $250 = $2,250. Adding the advance payment, the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer is $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350.

The cost difference between the two offers is $3,450 - $3,350 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of guns and then divide it by the number of people. 

First, let's add up the number of guns each person has: 
DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns. 
8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24

Now, we need to divide the total number of guns by the number of people. There are 4 people in total. 
24 / 4 = 6

So, if they were to share their guns equally, each of them would have 6 guns.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers. Since Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar for one batch of suckers, we multiply 30 ounces by 8 to get the total amount needed for 8 batches.

30 ounces/batch * 8 batches = 240 ounces

Next, we need to add the amount of sugar needed for 1 batch of fudge, which is 70 ounces.

Total sugar needed = 240 ounces (for suckers) + 70 ounces (for fudge)
Total sugar needed = 310 ounces

Therefore, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

The final answer is: 310"
"To determine the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the price of the shares after the first year and then after the second year.

Initially, Maria buys 8 shares for $8 each, so the total cost is 8 * 8 = $64.

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To calculate the new price, we multiply the original price by 1.5 (100% + 50% = 150%, or 1.5 as a decimal). 

New price after the first year = $8 * 1.5 = $12.

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. To calculate the new price, we multiply the price after the first year by 0.75 (100% - 25% = 75%, or 0.75 as a decimal).

New price after the second year = $12 * 0.75 = $9.

Now, we multiply the new price after the second year by the number of shares to find the total value of Maria's shares.

Total value = 8 * $9 = $72.

The final value of Maria's shares is $72."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of hot dogs each person ate and then find the difference between John and Luke's consumption.

Luke ate 2 hot dogs.

Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate 3 * 2 = 6 hot dogs.

John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

To find the difference between John and Luke's consumption, we subtract Luke's consumption from John's consumption: 3 - 2 = 1.

The final answer is: 1"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as x. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

2x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms again:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

Since the smallest group has x - 10 students, we can find the number of students in the smallest group by subtracting 10 from x:

70 - 10 = 60

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as CH. We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can write the equation:

C + CH = 60

We are also told that Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so we can write another equation:

CH = 2C

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first one:

C + 2C = 60

Combine like terms:

3C = 60

Divide both sides by 3:

C = 20

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens by substituting C into the second equation:

CH = 2C
CH = 2(20)
CH = 40

So, there are 20 cows and 40 chickens. 

To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of animal and add them together. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. 

Number of cow legs: 20 * 4 = 80
Number of chicken legs: 40 * 2 = 80

Total number of legs: 80 + 80 = 160

The final answer is: 160"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Josh starts with 3 balls. Each week, he adds 1 ball to his juggling act. So, after the first week, he has 3 + 1 = 4 balls. After the second week, he has 4 + 1 = 5 balls. After the third week, he has 5 + 1 = 6 balls. After the fourth week, he has 6 + 1 = 7 balls.

However, when Josh walks on stage, he drops 3 balls. 2 of them are caught by people in the crowd, but 1 gets lost. So, Josh is left with 7 - 1 = 6 balls.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the weights of the other animals and then add them to the weight of the container.

Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can set up the following equations based on the given information:

1. The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog: 
   Blue beetle = 50 pounds

2. The green toad also weighs the same as the pink frog:
   Green toad = 50 pounds

3. The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog:
   Yellow snake = 50 + 10 = 60 pounds

4. The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog:
   Red bird = 50 - 20 = 30 pounds

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the animals and the container:
Total weight = Pink frog + Blue beetle + Green toad + Yellow snake + Red bird + Container
Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20
Total weight = 260 pounds

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

Laurel initially received 24 baby outfits from her friend. 
Then, she received twice the amount of new baby outfits at her baby shower, which is 2 * 24 = 48 outfits. 
So, the total number of outfits she has now is 24 + 48 = 72 outfits. 
Laurel's mom gifted her with another 15 baby outfits, so we need to add 15 to the total number of outfits she already has. 
The total number of outfits is now 72 + 15 = 87 outfits.

"To find the total distance Tyson covered in June, we first need to determine the new daily distance he should run based on his coach's advice. 

The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day. To find 1/5 of 5000 meters, we multiply 5000 by 1/5, which is 1000 meters. 

So, the new daily distance is 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters.

Since there are 30 days in June, we multiply the new daily distance by 30 to find the total distance covered in June: 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.

The final answer is: 180000"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the prices of Juice Box B and Juice Box C in relation to Juice Box A.

Juice Box A is 4 dollars.
Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box B is 4 + 5 = 9 dollars.
Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box C is 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

Now, we need to find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B. To do this, we subtract the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C: 11 - 9 = 2.

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of arithmetic and algebra. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we have 40 tables with 4 legs each. The total number of legs from these tables can be calculated as:

40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs

Next, we have 50 tables with 3 legs each. The total number of legs from these tables can be calculated as:

50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs

Now, to find the total number of legs in the restaurant, we need to add the number of legs from both types of tables:

160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs

Therefore, the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310.

310"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by Jenny's son and her husband, and then subtract that from the total number of cookies in a bag.

Jenny's son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so he eats 4 * 5 = 20 cookies per week.

Jenny's husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats 1 * 7 = 7 cookies per week.

The total number of cookies consumed by Jenny's son and her husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies per week.

Since there are 36 cookies in a bag, and 27 cookies are consumed by Jenny's son and her husband, Jenny eats the remaining cookies. 

36 (total cookies) - 27 (cookies consumed by son and husband) = 9 cookies.

Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To find the amount Davos paid for the 2 shirts, we first need to calculate the discount on each shirt. The discount is 40% of the original price of $30. 

40% of $30 is calculated as 0.4 * 30 = $12. 

So, the discount on each shirt is $12. 

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the price after the discount: $30 - $12 = $18.

Since Davos bought 2 shirts, we multiply the price after the discount by 2: $18 * 2 = $36.

Therefore, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the percentage increase in the amount of money the factory is making per day, we need to first calculate the difference in the amount of money they are making per day now and the amount they used to make.

The factory used to make $100 per tractor and sold 10 tractors a day, so they made $100 * 10 = $1000 per day.

Now, they make $220 per silo and sell 5 silos a day, so they make $220 * 5 = $1100 per day.

The difference in the amount of money they are making per day now and the amount they used to make is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original amount and multiply by 100:

($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the total amount Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the monthly expenses and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the monthly expenses. 

Food costs $25 per week, and there are 4 weeks in a month, so the monthly food cost is:
$25/week * 4 weeks/month = $100/month

Treats cost $20 per month.

Medicine costs $100 per month.

The total monthly expenses are:
$100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total annual expenses are:
$220/month * 12 months/year = $2640/year

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of plant pots April needs for the daisies and roses, and then subtract that from the total number of plant pots she already bought.

First, let's calculate the number of plant pots needed for the roses. Since April needs twice as many plant pots for the roses as for the daisies, and she needs 30 plant pots for the daisies, she needs 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots for the roses.

The total number of plant pots needed for both the daisies and roses is 30 + 60 = 90.

Since April already bought 100 plant pots, we can subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the total number of plant pots she bought to find out how many she has left over: 100 - 90 = 10.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Andrea had after spending on the sweater and giving her brother $4. We can then subtract this amount from the initial amount she had to find out how much she saved.

Andrea initially had $36. She spent $11 on a sweater and gave her brother $4. So, the total amount she spent is $11 + $4 = $15.

To find out how much she had left, we subtract the amount she spent from the initial amount: $36 - $15 = $21.

Since she spent $15, the amount she saved is the initial amount minus the amount spent: $36 - $15 = $21.

However, the question asks for the amount Andrea saved, which is the amount she had left after spending. Therefore, the amount she saved is $21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total time John spent on all activities. 

Let's start by finding the time John spent swimming. Since he spent half the time swimming as he did boating, and he spent 6 hours boating, he spent 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming.

Next, we know that John watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so he spent 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows.

We are also given that watching shows was 30% of his total time. Let's denote the total time as 'T'. Then, 30% of T is 6 hours. We can write this as 0.3T = 6.

To find T, we can divide both sides by 0.3: T = 6 / 0.3 = 20.

Now that we know the total time, we can find the time John spent sightseeing. We are given that sightseeing was 40% of his total time. So, 40% of 20 is 0.4 * 20 = 8.

Therefore, John spent 8 hours sightseeing.

"To determine how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and subtract the amount she already has in her savings.

From her first job, she earns $10 per hour for 20 hours of work, so her earnings from the first job are 10 * 20 = $200.

From her second job, she earns $5 per hour for 15 hours of work, so her earnings from the second job are 5 * 15 = $75.

Her total earnings from both jobs are $200 + $75 = $275.

Since she already has $80 in her savings, we subtract this from her total earnings to find out how much she still needs to save: $275 - $80 = $195.

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save $195.

The final answer is: $195"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, let's find the height of the second tree, which is 5 feet more than the shortest tree. The shortest tree is 6 feet tall, so the second tree is 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.

Next, we need to find the combined height of the two shorter trees. The shortest tree is 6 feet tall, and the second tree is 11 feet tall, so their combined height is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

Now, we are told that the height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined. Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Dean spent on the toy cars and the teddy bears, and then add the extra $10 his mother gave him.

First, let's calculate the total amount spent on toy cars: 6 toy cars * $2 per toy car = $12.

Next, let's calculate the total amount spent on teddy bears: 5 teddy bears * $1 per teddy bear = $5.

Now, let's add the total amount spent on toy cars and teddy bears: $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially had $28. After spending $17, he had $28 - $17 = $11 left.

His mother then gave him an extra $10, so we add this to the $11 he had left: $11 + $10 = $21.

Therefore, Dean has $21 left.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities and subtract that from Morgan's budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the activities:

- Mini-golf: 1 round costs $5, but since Morgan and her friends will play, we need to consider the cost for all of them. However, we don't know the number of friends yet, so let's represent it as 'x'. The cost for mini-golf will be $5 * (x + 1), because Morgan is also playing.
- Arcade tokens: $5
- Go-karts: 2 rides cost $10 each, so the total cost for go-karts is $20.

The total cost for all activities is $5 * (x + 1) + $5 + $20.

Now, let's simplify the equation: $5x + $5 + $5 + $20 = $5x + $30.

We know Morgan's budget is $90, so we can set up the equation: $5x + $30 = $90.

To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. We can do this by subtracting $30 from both sides of the equation: $5x = $60.

Now, we can divide both sides by $5 to find the value of 'x': x = $60 / $5.

x = 12

So, Morgan can invite 12 friends.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much change Billy has after buying the candy. Since the candy costs $1.5 a pound, and Billy has $10, we can divide $10 by $1.5 to find out how many pounds of candy he can buy.

$10 / $1.5 = 6.67 pounds (round down to 6 pounds since you can't buy a fraction of a pound)

So, Billy buys 6 pounds of candy. 

Now, let's find out how much change he has after buying the candy. 

$10 (initial amount) - $9 (cost of 6 pounds of candy) = $1 (change)

Since Billy takes half of his change and spends it on gumballs, he spends $0.5 on gumballs.

Now, let's find out how many gumballs he can buy with $0.5.

$0.5 / $0.05 = 10 gumballs

However, we are given that he bought 40 gumballs, not 10. This means that the initial calculation of change is incorrect. Let's recalculate the change.

If Billy spent $9 on candy, he would have $1 left. But since he bought 40 gumballs, he must have spent more than $1 on gumballs. Let's find out how much he spent on gumballs.

$0.05 * 40 = $2

Since he spent $2 on gumballs, he must have had $2 more than $1 initially. 

$1 + $2 = $3

Now, let's find out how much he spent on candy.

$10 (initial amount) - $3 (change) = $7

$7 / $1.5 = 4.67 pounds (round down to 4 pounds)

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S. We are given that Carver is 45 years old, so C = 45.

We are also given that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. This can be expressed as an equation: C = 2S - 5.

Substituting the value of C into the equation, we get 45 = 2S - 5.

To solve for S, we need to isolate S on one side of the equation. First, we add 5 to both sides of the equation: 45 + 5 = 2S - 5 + 5.

This simplifies to 50 = 2S.

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for S: 50 / 2 = 2S / 2.

This simplifies to 25 = S.

Therefore, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip and then determine how many trips it takes to reach 18,000 miles. 

First, let's calculate the distance from the third city to the first city. The combined distance from the first city to the second city and the second city to the third city is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than that, so it is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

Now, let's calculate the total distance of one trip: 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train travels 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is 3 * 300 = 900 miles.

To find out how many days it takes to reach 18,000 miles, we divide 18,000 by 900: 18,000 / 900 = 20.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the amount of stuffing required for a collie bed. Since a collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed, we can calculate it as follows:

Average stuffing for a collie bed = (stuffing for Rottweiler bed + stuffing for chihuahua bed) / 2
= (8 + 2) / 2
= 10 / 2
= 5 pounds

Now, we can calculate the total amount of stuffing required for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds:

Total stuffing for chihuahua beds = 4 * 2 = 8 pounds
Total stuffing for collie beds = 3 * 5 = 15 pounds
Total stuffing required = 8 + 15 = 23 pounds

The final answer is: 23"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the trip to his friend's house and the trip back home.

For the trip to his friend's house, we need to calculate the total distance traveled, which is the original 200 miles plus the 10 miles added by the detour, so the total distance is 200 + 10 = 210 miles. 

The time taken for this trip can be calculated using the formula: time = distance / speed. So, time = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours.

For the trip back home, the distance is 240 miles and the speed is 80 mph. Using the same formula, time = distance / speed, we get time = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours.

The total time taken for the entire trip is the sum of the time taken for each part, which is 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours.

Therefore, the trip took 6 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of students absent on Friday, and then subtract that from the total number of students to find the number of students present. 

First, let's find the total number of students absent on Friday. We know that 5 fourth-grade girls and 4 fourth-grade boys were absent. So, the total number of students absent is 5 + 4 = 9.

Now, let's find the total number of students present on Friday. We know that there are 96 fourth-graders in total, and 9 were absent. So, the total number of students present is 96 - 9 = 87.

Since we are asked to find the number of fourth-grade boys present, we need to subtract the number of girls present from the total number of students present. We know that 43 girls are in the fourth grade, and 5 were absent. So, the number of girls present is 43 - 5 = 38.

Now, we can find the number of boys present by subtracting the number of girls present from the total number of students present: 87 - 38 = 49.

The final answer is: 49"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of boys in the park and then add it to the number of girls. 

Since there are twice the number of boys as girls, and there are 6 girls, we can calculate the number of boys by multiplying the number of girls by 2. 

Number of boys = 2 * Number of girls
Number of boys = 2 * 6
Number of boys = 12

Now, we can find the total number of kids in the park by adding the number of boys and girls.

Total number of kids = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of kids = 12 + 6
Total number of kids = 18

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test to reach a total of at least 42 points. 

Let's start by calculating the total points Jane has already scored on the first two tests: 15 + 18 = 33 points.

Since Jane needs a total of at least 42 points, we need to find the minimum number of points she must score on the third test to reach this goal. 

To do this, we subtract the total points she has already scored from the required total: 42 - 33 = 9 points.

Therefore, Jane must score at least 9 points on the third test to pass.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as M, the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting as S, and the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as V.

We are given that M = 3.

We are also given that the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks minus 5, so S = 4M - 5 = 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7.

We are also given that the number of customers kicked out for physical violence is three times the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting, so V = 3S = 3(7) = 21.

We are given that a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart. We can write an equation to represent this: M + S + V = 50.

Substituting the values we found earlier, we get 3 + 7 + 21 = 31.

Since we know that the total number of people kicked out is 50, and 31 were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, or physical violence, we can find the number of people kicked out for other reasons by subtracting 31 from 50.

Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is 50 - 31 = 19.

Now, we are given that Erin now has 14 points. To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to subtract the current points from the points Erin had before. However, we don't know the points Erin had before. Let's call the points Erin had before 'x'. We can set up the equation: x + 14 = 24.

To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 14 from both sides of the equation: x = 24 - 14.

x = 10

So, Erin had 10 points before."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each picture frame costs $20, and the logo etching costs an additional 20% of the frame's cost. 

20% of $20 is 0.2 * 20 = $4. 

So, the total cost of each picture frame is $20 + $4 = $24.

Since there are 44 seniors, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

Next, 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each. The total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the cords for the officers. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 officers.

The cost of the cords for the officers is 11 * $12 = $132.

The total cost of the senior gifts is the sum of the cost of the picture frames, the cost of the pins, and the cost of the cords for the officers.

Total cost = $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final answer is: $1198"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the amount saved by making the wallpaper DIY. The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. 

The DIY saves 20% of the original cost. To find 20% of $400, we multiply $400 by 0.20. 

20% of $400 = 0.20 * $400 = $80

So, the amount saved by making the wallpaper DIY is $80. 

Now, we need to find the total cost of making the wallpaper DIY. This includes the cost of materials. Since we saved $80, the cost of materials is $400 - $80 = $320.

The total cost of making the wallpaper DIY is the cost of materials, which is $320.

The final answer is: $320"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs on Sunday, so we need to subtract those from the total number of pairs sold on Sunday. 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, we need to find the total number of pairs sold over the weekend. We add the pairs sold on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday: 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 pairs.

Since each pair consists of two shoes, we multiply the total number of pairs by 2 to find the total number of shoes sold: 50 * 2 = 100.

The final answer is: 100"
"To determine the total number of hours Hallie had dance practice per week, we need to calculate the total hours from each day and add them together.

On Tuesdays, Hallie had dance practice for 1 hour.
On Thursdays, she had dance practice for 2 hours.
On Saturdays, her practice lasted twice as long as Tuesday's night class, which is 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

Now, let's add the total hours from each day: 1 (Tuesday) + 2 (Thursday) + 2 (Saturday) = 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the value of the faulty equipment and then subtract that from the total amount spent.

The total amount spent is $400,000. 40% of this amount is faulty, so we need to find 40% of $400,000.

40% of $400,000 = 0.4 * $400,000 = $160,000

This is the value of the faulty equipment. To find the value of the functioning equipment, we subtract this from the total amount spent.

Value of functioning equipment = Total amount spent - Value of faulty equipment
= $400,000 - $160,000
= $240,000

The final answer is: $240,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of milk Mary collects from the two groups of sheep.

First, let's find out how many sheep are in each group. Since Mary has 30 sheep and half of them produce 1 kg of milk each day, we can calculate the number of sheep in this group as follows:

30 / 2 = 15 sheep

These 15 sheep produce 1 kg of milk each day, so the total milk from this group is:

15 * 1 = 15 kg

The other half of the sheep produce 2 kg of milk each day. Since there are also 15 sheep in this group, the total milk from this group is:

15 * 2 = 30 kg

Now, we add the milk from both groups to find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day:

15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg

The final answer is: 45"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of rolls left after feeding the children. Mrs. Sherman started with a dozen rolls, which is 12 rolls. She fed 6 children, so she had 12 - 6 = 6 rolls left.

Since she broke each of the remaining rolls into 8 pieces, we need to multiply the number of rolls left by 8. 6 rolls * 8 pieces per roll = 48 pieces.

Therefore, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

48"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down step by step.

First, we know that half of the class likes blue. Since there are 40 pupils in the class, half of them would be 40 / 2 = 20 pupils who like blue.

Now, we are left with the remaining pupils who do not like blue. This would be 40 - 20 = 20 pupils.

Next, we are told that one-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. One-fourth of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5 pupils who like green.

Now, we are left with the remaining pupils who do not like green. This would be 20 - 5 = 15 pupils.

Since the rest of the pupils like yellow, the number of pupils who like yellow is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of apples Lucy picked on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. 

Let's denote the number of apples picked on Monday as 'x'. Since Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday, she sold 'x' apples. We know that she got $56 from selling these apples, and each apple costs $4. So, we can set up the equation:

4x = 56

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 56 / 4
x = 14

So, Lucy picked 14 apples on Monday.

On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we add the number of apples picked each day:

Total apples = 14 + 12 + 24
Total apples = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of socks that Lindsay has washed. Since she washed 10 pairs of socks, and each pair consists of 2 socks, she has washed 10 * 2 = 20 socks from the pairs. Additionally, she washed 15 loose socks. 

The total number of socks she has washed is 20 (from pairs) + 15 (loose socks) = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks that need washing in total, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is 50 - 35 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To determine the number of cookies left for Rachel, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she initially had and then subtract the number of cookies her brother ate.

Initially, Rachel had 23 cookies. Janet gave her 42 cookies, so we add 42 to 23 to get the total number of cookies Rachel had. 

23 + 42 = 65

Her brother ate 44 cookies, so we subtract 44 from the total number of cookies Rachel had.

65 - 44 = 21

Therefore, there are 21 cookies left for Rachel. 

21"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the monthly payment (M) that Karan has to pay. We can use the formula for the present value of an annuity:

M = P * r * (1 + r)^n / ((1 + r)^n - 1)

where:
- P = principal amount (initial loan) = $3,650
- r = monthly interest rate = 10%/year / 12 months/year = 0.008333 (or 10/12,000)
- n = number of payments = 5 months

However, since the interest rate is annual and we are calculating monthly payments, we can simplify the formula by using the formula for monthly payments on a loan:

M = P * r / (1 - (1 + r)^(-n))

Plugging in the values, we get:

M = 3650 * 0.008333 / (1 - (1 + 0.008333)^(-5))
M ≈ 3650 * 0.008333 / (1 - 0.924)
M ≈ 3650 * 0.008333 / 0.076
M ≈ 3650 * 0.109
M ≈ 398.15

So, Karan has to pay approximately $398.15 per month.

The final answer is: $398.15"
"To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we need to calculate the total distance each person hiked.

Cho hiked at a speed of 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours. The distance Cho hiked can be calculated as speed multiplied by time: 14 km/h * 8 h = 112 km.

Chloe hiked at a speed of 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours. The distance Chloe hiked can be calculated as speed multiplied by time: 9 km/h * 5 h = 45 km.

To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked: 112 km - 45 km = 67 km.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of silver and gold pesos each person has. 

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. 

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. 

Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, we can calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos they have together. 

Total silver pesos = 50 (Axel's) + 100 (Anna's) = 150
Total gold pesos = 80 (Axel's) + 120 (Anna's) = 200

The total number of pesos they have together is the sum of the total silver and gold pesos. 

Total pesos = Total silver pesos + Total gold pesos = 150 + 200 = 350

"To determine Millie's profit per hour, we need to calculate her total revenue and subtract her total cost.

First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make with the supplies she bought. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she bought enough supplies to make 3 pitchers, she can make 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue will be the number of cups sold multiplied by the price per cup. However, we need to know how many hours she operates the stand to calculate the total revenue. Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she has 36 cups, we can calculate the number of hours she operates the stand by dividing the total cups by the cups sold per hour: 36 / 4 = 9 hours.

Now, we can calculate the total revenue: 36 cups * $1 per cup = $36.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. Millie spent $18 to buy the supplies.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $36 - $18 = $18.

Since we know she operates the stand for 9 hours, we can calculate her profit per hour by dividing the total profit by the number of hours: $18 / 9 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as 'x'. Since he sold 3/5 of his land, the amount of land he had left is 2/5 of the initial amount, which is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation: (2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2 to isolate x:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land initially.

32"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that the choir has 52 members, with 50% boys and 50% girls. This means there are 26 boys and 26 girls.

Since the choir decides to perform with just its female members, the initial number of performers is 26 (all the girls).

However, half the people performing can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down. This means half of 26 is 13, so 13 girls cannot make it. Therefore, the remaining number of girls who can perform is 26 - 13 = 13.

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is 13 (remaining girls) + 3 (teachers) = 16.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of messages James delivers to Mr. Yu and then add it to the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson.

First, let's find out how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can calculate this by multiplying the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can find the total number of messages James delivers by adding the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and the number of messages to Mr. Yu.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of the rides for both David and Dasha.

David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides. Since each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, the cost of the rides for David is 9 rides * 2 tickets per ride * $2 per ticket = $36. However, he only paid $30 for the bracelet, so he actually saves $6.

Dasha buys tickets for 9 rides. The cost of the tickets for Dasha is 9 rides * 2 tickets per ride * $2 per ticket = $36.

The difference in cost between Dasha's tickets and David's bracelet is $36 - $30 = $6.

Therefore, David saves $6.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of gifts Monica needs to wrap and then divide the total amount of ribbon by that number.

Monica has 6 gifts for her family, 4 gifts for her friends, and 2 gifts for her teachers, making a total of 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts.

Since she wants to make a bow for each gift, she will need to use the total amount of ribbon (144 inches) to make 12 bows.

To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each bow, we divide the total amount of ribbon by the number of gifts: 144 inches / 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift.

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios and proportions. Let's assume the number of popsicles Betty has is 5x and the number of popsicles Sam has is 6x, where x is a constant.

Since the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, we can set up the equation:

5x + 6x = 165

Combine like terms:

11x = 165

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 15

Now that we know x, we can find the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have:

Betty has 5x = 5(15) = 75 popsicles
Sam has 6x = 6(15) = 90 popsicles

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

90 - 75 = 15

"To determine the amount of money Tim saves by canceling his cable subscription, we need to calculate the cost of the streaming services and compare it to the cost of the cable package.

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month.

Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but Tim saves 20% by bundling. To find the bundled cost, we need to calculate 20% of $10 and subtract it from the total cost of the two services.

20% of $10 is 0.20 x $10 = $2.

The bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 + $10 - $2 = $18.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $18 (bundled Hulu and Disney Plus) = $28.

Since Tim saves $60 by canceling his cable subscription, we need to compare this to the cost of the streaming services to find the actual savings.

However, the question asks for the amount of money Tim saves by canceling his cable package, not the difference between the cable package and the streaming services. Therefore, the answer is simply the cost of the cable package, which is $60.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark. 

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, we can calculate the number of slices Bill gets by multiplying 12 by 1/3. 

12 * (1/3) = 12 * 1 / 3 = 12 / 3 = 4 slices

Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. We can calculate the number of slices Mark gets by multiplying 12 by 1/4.

12 * (1/4) = 12 * 1 / 4 = 12 / 4 = 3 slices

Now, we know that Jenny gives 4 slices to Bill and 3 slices to Mark. So, the total number of slices given away is 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny eats 2 slices, so the total number of slices left is 12 - (7 + 2) = 12 - 9 = 3 slices.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days Mark needs to work to save enough money to buy the bike. 

First, let's calculate how much more money Mark needs to save to buy the bike. The bike costs $300, and Mark already has $50 in his bank account. So, he needs to save $300 - $50 = $250.

Since Mark earns $10 per day, we can divide the amount he needs to save ($250) by his daily earnings ($10) to find out how many days he needs to work.

$250 ÷ $10 = 25

Therefore, Mark needs to work for 25 days to save enough money to buy the bike.

Beth's age = 30 + 5
Beth's age = 35

Now, we know that Alice is 7 years older than Beth. 
Alice's age = Beth's age + 7
Alice's age = 35 + 7

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of flour and milk required for the quadruple batch of brownies and then calculate the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk needed.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, we multiply the ingredients by 4:

- Flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
- Milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, we need to divide the total amount of flour required by 2 to find out how many bags Mark needs to buy:
12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags

Similarly, since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we divide the total amount of milk required by 2 to find out how many bottles Mark needs to buy:
4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles

Now, we need to find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy. To do this, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
6 bags (flour) - 2 bottles (milk) = 4

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the energy consumption of the air conditioner in watt-hours (Wh) and then convert it to kilowatt-hours (kWh). 

First, let's calculate the energy consumption per day when Mel uses the air conditioner for 8 hours:

Energy consumption per day = Power (watts) * Time (hours) 
= 900 watts * 8 hours 
= 7200 Wh or 7.2 kWh

Now, let's calculate the energy consumption per day when Mel uses the air conditioner for 3 hours (8 - 5 = 3):

Energy consumption per day = Power (watts) * Time (hours) 
= 900 watts * 3 hours 
= 2700 Wh or 2.7 kWh

The energy saved per day is the difference between the original energy consumption and the reduced energy consumption:

Energy saved per day = Original energy consumption - Reduced energy consumption 
= 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh 
= 4.5 kWh

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the energy saved per day by 30:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people and then calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese needed.

Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we can divide the total number of people (20) by the number of people served per sandwich (4) to find the total number of sandwiches required:

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we need a total of 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so the total cost of the meat is:

5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so the total cost of the cheese is:

5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is the sum of the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese:

$35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

Therefore, Tyson would spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that Allan initially has 40 cannolis. Since there are twice as many corns as cannolis, he initially has 2 * 40 = 80 corns.

Allan then buys 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Since he bought 60 cannolis, he now has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.

The number of corns he bought is 40 fewer than the number of cannolis, so he bought 60 - 40 = 20 corns.

Now, Allan has 80 (initial corns) + 20 (new corns) = 100 corns.

The total number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 (cannolis) + 100 (corns) = 200.

The final answer is: 200"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Elliott wants to walk 10,000 steps in total. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Half of 10,000 is 5,000 steps. 

So, he has completed 5,000 steps. 

He then did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. 

Now, he has completed 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

He still has 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. 

Since he completed 6,000 steps, the number of steps he took during his jog is the difference between his goal and the steps he has already completed. 

So, the number of steps he took during his jog is 10,000 - 6,000 = 4,000 steps.

The final answer is: 4000"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take Toby to read the book and then subtract that from the total time available before he needs to leave for the airport.

First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book: 
45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words

Next, we need to calculate how long it will take Toby to read the book:
9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

Now, we need to add the time it takes to get to the airport:
30 minutes (reading time) + 10 minutes (travel time) = 40 minutes

Since Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to leave, we can subtract the total time it will take him to read and travel from the total time available:
60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

Therefore, Toby will be 20 minutes early. 

The final answer is: 20"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to first determine the number of employees who remained employed in June and their total hours worked.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 of 40 is 10 employees. So, 40 - 10 = 30 employees remained employed in June.

The total number of employees in May was 40, and each employee worked 40 hours per week for 4 weeks, resulting in a total of 40 * 40 * 4 = 6400 hours worked in May.

In June, 30 employees worked 40 hours per week for 4 weeks, resulting in a total of 30 * 40 * 4 = 4800 hours worked in June.

The hourly wage is $15. Therefore, the total amount paid in May is 6400 * $15 = $96,000, and the total amount paid in June is 4800 * $15 = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

The final answer is: $168,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Sally bought and subtract that from the initial amount of money she had.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means that the second pound is half off, so the cost of the second pound is $3 * 0.5 = $1.5. The total cost of 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.5 = $4.5.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. Sally bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $4.5 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally initially had $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the fireworks and the finale firework. 

First, let's find the cost of the two packs of fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice that much, which is 2 * $400 = $800. The total cost of the two packs is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Since Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packs, we need to calculate the discount amount. The discount amount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.2 * $1200 = $240.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost of the two packs to get the final cost of the fireworks: $1200 - $240 = $960.

The finale firework costs $150. To find the total amount Tim spent, we add the cost of the fireworks and the finale firework: $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of cookies Shannon will need for 30 days and then divide that by the number of cookies her recipe makes.

Shannon eats 2 cookies per night, so for 30 days, she will need 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies needed by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs to make.

60 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5 dozens.

Therefore, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. 

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the candles have this defect, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of candles that smell like wet dog = Total number of candles * Percentage of candles with the defect
= 50000 * 0.05
= 2500

Now, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. Since the candles that explode are guaranteed to be 99% safe, it means that 1% of the candles can explode. However, we are not given the total number of candles that can explode, but rather the percentage of candles that are guaranteed not to explode. 

To find the number of candles that can explode, we can calculate the number of candles that are guaranteed not to explode and subtract it from the total number of candles:

Number of candles that are guaranteed not to explode = Total number of candles * Percentage of candles guaranteed not to explode
= 50000 * 0.99
= 49500

Now, we can find the number of candles that can explode by subtracting the number of candles that are guaranteed not to explode from the total number of candles:

Number of candles that can explode = Total number of candles - Number of candles that are guaranteed not to explode
= 50000 - 49500
= 500

However, we are interested in the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. Since 5% of the candles have the wet dog smell defect, and 1% of the candles can explode, we can assume that the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is a small fraction of the total number of candles that can explode. 

To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we can assume that the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is a small fraction of the number of candles that can explode. However, we are not given any information about the relationship between the two events. 

However, we can use the fact that the probability of two independent events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities. 

Let's assume that the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is x. Then, the probability of a candle smelling like wet dog is 0.05, and the probability of a candle exploding is 0.01. 

We can set up the following equation:

x / 50000 = 0.05 * 0.01

Solving for x, we get:

x = 0.05 * 0.01 * 50000
x = 25

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to determine the price of each blouse after the 30% discount. 

The regular price of each blouse is $20. To find the discount amount, we multiply the regular price by the discount percentage (30% or 0.3).

Discount amount = $20 * 0.3 = $6

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the regular price to get the discounted price of each blouse.

Discounted price = $20 - $6 = $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, we multiply the discounted price by 4 to find the total cost.

Total cost = $14 * 4 = $56

The final answer is: $56"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the tallest trees as T, from the average trees as A, and from the shortest trees as S. 

Since Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees, we have T = 30.

From the shortest trees, Joanne gathered half the amount she gathered from the tallest trees, so S = 30 / 2 = 15.

We know that Joanne's sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so the sister gathered 2T apples from the tallest trees. Since the sister gathered 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, she gathered 3S apples from the shortest trees.

The sister gathered no apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is T + A + S, and the total number of apples gathered by her sister is 2T + 3S.

We are given that the combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. So, we can write the equation:

T + A + S + 2T + 3S = 500

Substituting the values of T and S, we get:

30 + A + 15 + 2(30) + 3(15) = 500

Combine like terms:

30 + A + 15 + 60 + 45 = 500

Combine the constants:

150 + A = 500

Subtract 150 from both sides:

A = 350

The final answer is: 350"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

We know that the total number of heads is 180, and since each animal has one head, we can write the equation:

C + D = 180

We also know that the total number of bumps is 304, and since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, we can write the equation:

2C + D = 304

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve for C and D by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know C, we can substitute it into the first equation to solve for D:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd.

The final answer is: 56"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first four days. Since he traveled 200 kilometers every day, the total distance covered in the first four days is 4 * 200 = 800 kilometers.

Next, we need to find out how much distance Tom covered in the next two days. It is given that he covered 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers. So, in the next two days, Tom covered a total of 240 kilometers.

Now, let's add the distance covered in the first six days: 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers.

On the next day, Tom wasn't traveling at all, so we don't need to add any distance for that day.

During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance covered in the second week is 7 * 300 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, let's add the distance covered in the first six days and the distance covered in the second week: 1040 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

The final answer is: 3140"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between the sizes of the lockers. Let's denote the size of Timothy's locker as T, Zack's locker as Z, and Peter's locker as P.

We are given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, so P = 5.

We are also given that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, so P = (1/4)Z. Since P = 5, we can write:

5 = (1/4)Z
Z = 5 * 4
Z = 20

We are also given that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so Z = (1/2)T. Since Z = 20, we can write:

20 = (1/2)T
T = 20 * 2
T = 40

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 40"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the difference in elevation between Stanley's current position and the position of the comb. Since the comb fell 4,000 feet from Stanley's initial position, and he is now at 10,000 feet, we need to find the difference between 10,000 and the elevation of the ledge where the comb landed.

However, the problem states that the comb fell 4,000 feet to a ledge below, but it doesn't specify the elevation of the ledge. We can infer that the comb landed at an elevation of 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet.

Now, we need to find the difference in elevation between the comb's position (6,000 feet) and Oliver's position (3,000 feet). To do this, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet.

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

The final answer is: 3000"
"This problem can be approached using basic arithmetic operations. 

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital.
2. The first bank gave him $4000.
3. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Mr. Josue received from the banks: $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

To find the total capital Mr. Josue has now, we add the initial capital to the amount he received from the banks: $5000 + $12000 = $16000.

The final answer is: $16000"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.

Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats taken away by the boats is 4 * 5 = 20.

Now, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30.

Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of the remaining cats, we multiply 30 by 3/5: 30 * (3/5) = 18.

Now, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12.

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different periods and their respective costs.

1. The first 6 months cost $8 per month, so the total cost for this period is 6 * $8 = $48.
2. The next 8 months cost $12 per month, so the total cost for this period is 8 * $12 = $96.
3. After that, the price increased to $14 per month. Since 2 years have 24 months, and we've already accounted for 14 months, there are 24 - 14 = 10 months left. The cost for this period is 10 * $14 = $140.

Now, let's add up the costs for all the periods: $48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

The final answer is: $284"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the cost of the jogger jeans as J and the cost of the tattered jeans as T. We know that T = $28.

We are also given that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so we can write an equation: J = T - 6.

Substituting the value of T, we get J = 28 - 6, which simplifies to J = 22.

We are told that Cole saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can set up the following equation:

(1/3)(J - T) + (2/3)(T - T) = 6

Simplifying the equation, we get (1/3)(J - T) = 6.

Substituting the value of J, we get (1/3)(22 - 28) = 6.

Simplifying further, we get (1/3)(-6) = 6, which is not possible. This means that our initial assumption that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans is incorrect.

However, we can try another approach. Let's assume that the jogger jeans cost x dollars more than the tattered jeans. Then, we can write the equation: J = T + x.

We are given that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so we can write another equation: J = T - 6.

Equating the two expressions for J, we get T + x = T - 6.

Simplifying the equation, we get x = -6.

However, this is not possible since x cannot be negative. This means that our assumption that the jogger jeans cost x dollars more than the tattered jeans is also incorrect.

Let's try another approach. We are given that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so we can write the equation: J = T - 6.

We are also given that Cole saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can set up the following equation:

(1/3)(J - T) + (2/3)(T - T) = 6

Simplifying the equation, we get (1/3)(J - T) = 6.

Substituting the value of J, we get (1/3)(T - 6) = 6.

Simplifying further, we get T - 6 = 18.

Solving for T, we get T = 24.

Now that we have the value of T, we can find the value of J. We know that J = T - 6, so J = 24 - 6, which simplifies to J = 18.

The difference between the cost of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is J - T = 18 - 24 = -6.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then sum them up.

The capacity of the 4 buses is 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
The capacity of the 6 minibusses is 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
The capacity of the 10 minivans is 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then calculate the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden.

Let's denote the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders as x. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is x + 10.

We know that there are 3 store-bought feeders and 3 homemade feeders. Therefore, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x, and the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10).

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden is the sum of the birds attracted to the store-bought and homemade feeders. We are given that each feeder attracts 20 birds, but this is not the case. Instead, we are given that the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones. Since we don't know the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders, we can't directly use the information that each feeder attracts 20 birds.

However, we can use the fact that the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones. Let's denote the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders as x. Then, the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is x + 10.

Since each feeder attracts the same number of birds, we can set up the equation: x + 10 = 20. Solving for x, we get x = 10.

Now that we know the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders, we can calculate the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders: 3x = 3(10) = 30.

The total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10) = 3(10 + 10) = 3(20) = 60.

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden is the sum of the birds attracted to the store-bought and homemade feeders: 30 + 60 = 90.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the soup. The bagel costs $4, and the soup is 25% more expensive. To find 25% of $4, we multiply $4 by 0.25, which is $1. Then, we add this to the cost of the bagel: $4 + $1 = $5. So, the soup costs $5.

Next, we need to find the cost of the cake. The cake is half the price of the bagel, which is $4. To find half of $4, we divide $4 by 2, which is $2. So, the cake costs $2.

Now, we add the costs of the soup, bagel, and cake together: $5 (soup) + $4 (bagel) + $2 (cake) = $11.

The final answer is: $11"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, let's determine how much money Kenny needs to make from selling his cards to buy the ticket. Since he already has $50, he needs to make $100 - $50 = $50 from selling his cards.

Since he plans to sell each card for $1.5, we can find out how many cards he needs to sell to make $50 by dividing $50 by $1.5. 

$50 / $1.5 = 33.33

However, Kenny can't sell a fraction of a card, so he must have sold an integer number of cards. This means he must have sold at least 34 cards to have enough money to buy the ticket.

Now, let's consider the fact that Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards. If he sold 34 cards, then he must have had 34 + 34 = 68 cards initially, since the 34 cards he sold represent 2/3 of his total.

Therefore, Kenny started with 68 cards.

The final answer is: 68"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, the caterer prepared enough hot dogs for half of the guests to have two hot dogs. Since there are 36 guests, half of them would be 36 / 2 = 18. So, the caterer prepared enough hot dogs for 18 guests to have two hot dogs each.

This means the caterer prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hot dogs for the first 18 guests. However, since the caterer prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hot dogs, the total number of hot dogs prepared is actually for 36 guests, but only 18 of them are to have two hotdogs.

Now, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog. Since the caterer had prepared enough hot dogs for 36 guests, but only 18 of them were to have two hot dogs, the caterer had 36 hot dogs. 

Since 40 guests showed up, and each of them wanted a second hot dog, the total number of hot dogs needed is 40 * 2 = 80. However, the caterer only had 36 hot dogs. 

To find out how many guests did not get a second hot dog, we need to find out how many hot dogs were left after the first 18 guests had their two hot dogs. Since the first 18 guests had two hot dogs each, they had a total of 18 * 2 = 36 hot dogs. 

Now, we subtract the number of hot dogs the first 18 guests had from the total number of hot dogs the caterer had: 36 - 36 = 0. This means there were no hot dogs left for the remaining 22 guests (40 - 18 = 22). 

However, we are asked to find out how many guests did not get a second hot dog, not how many hot dogs were left. Since there were 22 guests who showed up after the first 18, and they were all denied a second hot dog, the answer is 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name. 

First, we find half of the letters in Indras' name: 6 / 2 = 3. 
Then, we add 4 to this number to find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name: 3 + 4 = 7.

Now, we add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name to find the total number of letters: 6 + 7 = 13.

"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount and then apply the 20% discount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The set of pot and pans costs $120.00
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00
- 5 separate utensils at $5.00 each will cost 5 x $5.00 = $25.00

The total cost of the items before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Now, let's apply the 20% discount to the total cost:

20% of $165.00 is 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00

The discount amount is $33.00, so we subtract this from the total cost:

$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

Therefore, the total cost of Charlotte's order after the discount is $132.00.

The final answer is: $132.00"
"To determine how much more money Dora needs, we must first calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy. The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. 

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Dora has $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother, so she has a total of $2 + $16 = $18.

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost of the items.

Amount needed = Total cost - Amount Dora has
Amount needed = $19 - $18

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the amount of gas in each container and then find out how much Josey needs for her lawnmower.

Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we can find the amount of gas in each container by dividing 15 gallons by 5:

15 gallons / 5 = 3 gallons per container

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we can convert the amount of gas in each container from gallons to pints:

3 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 24 pints per container

Josey needs 1/4 of a container to run her lawnmower, so we can find the amount of gas she needs by multiplying the amount of gas in each container by 1/4:

24 pints/container * 1/4 = 6 pints

Therefore, Josey needs 6 pints of gasoline to run her lawnmower.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much money George had initially. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can calculate his initial amount as follows:

Let's assume George's initial amount of money is x. After spending $5, he had 1% of his money left, which is 0.01x. We know that 0.01x = 5. 

To find x, we can divide both sides by 0.01:
x = 5 / 0.01
x = 500

So, George initially had $500.

Now, let's calculate how much he spent on chips. Each bag of chips costs 40 cents, and he bought 3 bags:

Since he spent $5 in total, we can subtract the amount spent on chips from the total to find out how much he spent on candy bars:
5 - 1.20 = 3.80

Now, we know that each candy bar costs 75 cents. To find out how many candy bars he bought, we can divide the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of each candy bar:
3.80 / 0.75 = 5.07

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can see that 5 candy bars would cost 3.75, and 6 candy bars would cost 4.50, so the amount spent on candy bars must be between 5 and 6. 

However, we can also see that 5.07 is very close to 5, and the problem statement does not specify that George must have bought a whole number of candy bars. Therefore, we can conclude that George bought 5 candy bars.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of lollipops Ray shared with his friends. Since he kept 5 lollipops for himself, we subtract this from the total number of lollipops he had:

25 (total lollipops) - 5 (lollipops kept by Ray) = 20 lollipops

Since Ray shared the remaining lollipops equally with his four friends, we need to divide the number of lollipops shared by the number of friends:

20 lollipops / 4 friends = 5 lollipops per friend

Therefore, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

The final answer is: 5"
"This problem can be approached through a simple division and subtraction. 

First, we need to find out how much each piece of cake weighs. Since the cake weighs 20 ounces and is cut into 8 pieces, we divide 20 by 8 to get the weight of each piece. 

20 ounces / 8 pieces = 2.5 ounces per piece

Now, we know that Rory and her mom each have a piece, so 2 pieces are taken. 

The weight of the remaining cake can be found by subtracting the weight of the 2 pieces from the total weight of the cake.

20 ounces (total) - 2 * 2.5 ounces (2 pieces) = 20 - 5 = 15 ounces

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have. 

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. 

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56

Since they are sharing the oranges equally among 8 people (Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends), we need to divide the total number of oranges by 8.

Total oranges / 8 = 56 / 8 = 7

So, everyone will get 7 oranges."
"To determine the cost per serving, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and divide it by the number of servings.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the onions. Antoine wants to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of onions is $2.00 per pound, so the total cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the beef stock. Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is the sum of the cost of onions and beef stock, which is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Since the soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is the total cost divided by the number of servings: $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater and then calculate how much earlier she needs to leave than Wayne.

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, Bernadette's drive will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

However, Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne arrives in 4 minutes, Bernadette needs to arrive in 4 - 5 = -1 minute. But since time can't be negative, this means Bernadette needs to leave before Wayne to arrive 1 minute after him.

To find out how much earlier Bernadette needs to leave, we need to calculate the difference in their arrival times. Since Bernadette needs to arrive 1 minute after Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, she needs to leave 16 - 4 = 12 minutes before Wayne.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room. Since we are given the area and the length, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length * Width.

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so 3 yards is equal to 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Now we can use the formula for the area to find the width: 360 = 9 * Width. To find the width, we divide both sides of the equation by 9: Width = 360 / 9 = 40 feet.

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width). Plugging in the values, we get Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40) = 2 * 49 = 98 feet.

The final answer is: 98"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister has. 

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has 1 * 20 + 2 * 20 = 60 beads.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has 3 * 20 + 4 * 20 = 100 beads.

To find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has: 100 - 60 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, the total temperature increase due to baking is 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees.

The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. After baking, the temperature becomes 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.

Then, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, which is 3 times 10 minutes, the house cools down 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

The final temperature of the house is 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.

The final answer is: 49"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon. 

Jon's total time = 40 minutes (swim) + 80 minutes (bike ride) + 50 minutes (run) = 170 minutes.

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 170 minutes - 10 minutes = 160 minutes.

We know that James finished the swim 10% faster than Jon. 10% of 40 minutes is 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes. So, James' swim time is 40 minutes - 4 minutes = 36 minutes.

We also know that James took 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. Jon's bike time is 80 minutes, so James' bike time is 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes.

Now, we can calculate James' run time by subtracting his swim and bike times from his total time. James' run time = 160 minutes - 36 minutes - 85 minutes = 39 minutes.

The final answer is: 39"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Movie C is 1.25 hours long. We need to convert this to minutes because the other movies' lengths are given in minutes. 

1 hour = 60 minutes, so 1.25 hours = 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Now, we know that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, Movie B's length is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

We are also told that Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. To find Movie A's length, we need to multiply Movie B's length by 1/4.

Movie A's length = (1/4) * 80 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the horse runs, the amount of hay it consumes, and then the cost of the hay. 

First, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours since the speed is given in miles per hour. 

30 minutes is 30/60 = 0.5 hours.

Now, we can calculate the distance the horse runs: 
Distance = Speed * Time = 32 MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, it will eat 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of hay is 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of 6 * $5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the cost of the hay from the total amount of money Michael has: 
Change = $30 - $24 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of eggs Rozanne has and then divide that by the number of eggs needed per glass, and finally divide that by the number of glasses per tray.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs. Rozanne uses 4 dozen eggs from cases, which is 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. She also uses 2 loose eggs. So, the total number of eggs is 48 + 2 = 50.

Each glass needs 5 eggs, so the total number of glasses that can be made is 50 / 5 = 10.

Each tray holds 5 glasses, so the total number of trays that can be put out is 10 / 5 = 2.

The final answer is: 2"
"To determine the difference in points between Joey and Marcy, we need to calculate their current scores after their turns.

Joey initially had 214 points and scored 26 points, so his new score is 214 + 26 = 240 points.

Marcy initially had 225 points and scored 10 points, so her new score is 225 + 10 = 235 points.

The difference between their scores is 240 - 235 = 5 points.

"To determine the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from the sale of the sneakers and subtract the initial cost.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday: 17 sneakers * $20 = $340.

The salesman sold the rest of the sneakers (48 - 17 = 31) to the department store for $25 each. So, the revenue from the department store sale is: 31 sneakers * $25 = $775.

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the department store sale: $340 + $775 = $1115.

The initial cost of the case of sneakers was $576. To find the profit, we subtract the initial cost from the total revenue: $1115 - $576 = $539.

The salesman's profit is $539.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of crayons Beatrice bought. 

First, let's find the total number of crayons in the six packets with eight pieces each: 6 * 8 = 48.

Next, let's find the total number of crayons in the four packets with sixteen pieces each: 4 * 16 = 64.

Now, we add the total number of crayons from both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112.

Therefore, Beatrice bought 112 crayons in all.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as P. 

The total cost of buying a movie ticket for $12 and one popcorn and a soda at regular price is 12 + P + 3.

The total cost of buying a movie super ticket for $20 and one popcorn and a soda for $1 extra is 20 + 1 = 21.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the equation can be set up as follows:

12 + P + 3 = 21 - 2

Simplifying the equation:

12 + P + 3 = 19

Subtract 12 and 3 from both sides:

P = 19 - 12 - 3
P = 4

The final answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as x. Since the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, we can set up the equation:

20x = 900

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

x = 900 / 20
x = 45

So, the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, making the new cost of filling one balloon $65.

Now, we need to find the total cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price. We can multiply the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons:

Total cost = 65 * 170
Total cost = 11050

Therefore, Bentley paid $11,050 to fill 170 balloons after the price increase.

The final answer is: $11050"
"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 mph x 2 hours = 120 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour:
Distance = Speed x Time = 30 mph x 1 hour = 30 miles

Now, let's find the total distance traveled:
Total Distance = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

The total time taken for the trip is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

To find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of the sapphires and rubies Jenna has after the trade. 

Initially, Jenna has 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. This means she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left. 

The value of the sapphires she has left is 5 * $800 = $4000. 

The value of the 2 rubies she got in exchange is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

"This question can be approached from a mathematical perspective, specifically through the application of arithmetic operations. To find the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of apples each of them eats in 30 days and then sum those amounts.

Marin eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, he eats 4 * 30 = 120 apples.

Nancy also eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, she eats 4 * 30 = 120 apples.

To find the total number of apples they eat together, we add the number of apples Marin eats to the number of apples Nancy eats: 120 + 120 = 240.

Therefore, Marin and Nancy eat a total of 240 apples in 30 days.

The final answer is: 240"
"To determine the total cost of the potting soil, we need to calculate the total volume of soil required and then divide it by the volume of each bag, rounding up to the nearest whole number since we can't buy a fraction of a bag. 

First, let's calculate the volume of each raised bed: 
Volume = length * width * height = 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is: 
Total Volume = 10 * 32 = 320 cubic feet.

Now, let's calculate the number of bags needed: 
Number of bags = Total Volume / Volume per bag = 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Since we can't buy a fraction of a bag, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can buy 160 bags, which is a whole number.

Now, let's calculate the total cost: 
Total Cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag = 160 * $12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of green cards = Number of red cards + (60% of Number of red cards)
= 15 + (0.6 * 15)
= 15 + 9
= 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards:

Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to make, we must first calculate the total weight of all the feed. 

The weight of the sugar cubes is 2 boxes * 1 pound per box = 2 pounds.

The weight of the carrots is 4 bags * 12 pounds per bag = 48 pounds.

The weight of the hay is 42 bales * 75 pounds per bale = 3150 pounds.

The weight of the oats is 20 sacks * 65 pounds per sack = 1300 pounds.

The total weight of all the feed is 2 pounds + 48 pounds + 3150 pounds + 1300 pounds = 3400 pounds.

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck to find the number of trips.

3400 pounds / 2250 pounds per trip = 1.51 trips.

Since the farmer cannot make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the earnings from aluminum cans. Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week, and each can is worth 2 cents. So, her weekly earnings from aluminum cans are 3 * 2 = 6 cents.

Next, let's calculate the earnings from plastic bottles. Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week, and each bottle is worth 3 cents. So, her weekly earnings from plastic bottles are 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

Now, let's calculate the total weekly earnings from both aluminum cans and plastic bottles. Total weekly earnings = 6 cents (aluminum cans) + 15 cents (plastic bottles) = 21 cents.

Since Grayson earns 21 cents per week, her earnings for a four-week month would be 21 cents * 4 = 84 cents.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of basketball cards and baseball cards Miss Maria has. 

She has six decks of basketball cards, each with 25 cards. So, the total number of basketball cards is 6 * 25 = 150.

She has five boxes of baseball cards, each with 40 cards. So, the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200.

The total number of cards Miss Maria has is the sum of basketball cards and baseball cards, which is 150 + 200 = 350.

Since Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, the number of cards she gives to her students is 350 - 50 = 300.

Each student gets 10 cards, so the number of students is 300 / 10 = 30.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, there are 30 students, each with 10 pencils. So, the total number of pencils at the beginning of the year is 30 * 10 = 300.

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. This means 1/5 of 300 pencils were used. To find 1/5 of 300, we multiply 300 by 1/5, which is the same as dividing 300 by 5. So, 300 / 5 = 60 pencils were used.

Now, we subtract the used pencils from the initial total to find the remaining pencils after two months: 300 - 60 = 240 pencils.

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. This means 1/3 of 240 pencils were left. To find 1/3 of 240, we multiply 240 by 1/3, which is the same as dividing 240 by 3. So, 240 / 3 = 80 pencils were left.

"This problem can be approached using algebra. Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. According to the given condition, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as (1/2)x + 2.

Since Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, we can set up the equation: (1/2)x + 2 = 5.

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable. First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: (1/2)x = 5 - 2, which simplifies to (1/2)x = 3.

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction: x = 3 * 2, which simplifies to x = 6.

"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert their individual lengths to feet and then add them together. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 6 inches to feet by dividing by 12.

6 inches / 12 = 0.5 feet

Since there are two remoras, we multiply the length of one remora by 2.

0.5 feet * 2 = 1 foot

Now, we add the length of the remoras to the length of the shark.

10 feet (shark) + 1 foot (remoras) = 11 feet

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy, we divide the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100.

(1 foot / 10 feet) * 100 = 10%

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of proportions. If three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, then one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We are given that 20 students do not have a desktop computer, which represents one-fourth of the total number of students.

Let's denote the total number of students as 'x'. Since one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer, we can set up the equation:

1/4 * x = 20

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 20 * 4
x = 80

Therefore, there are 80 students at that grade level.

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of minutes Jason has available to walk in three weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so in three weeks, there are 3 * 7 = 21 days. Since Jason can walk 4 days a week, he has 4 * 3 = 12 days to walk.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of minutes Jason needs to walk to break in the shoes. This is given as 240 minutes. To find out how many minutes he needs to walk each day, we divide the total number of minutes by the number of days he has to walk: 240 minutes / 12 days = 20 minutes per day.

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of books Sarah bought. Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can divide the total amount spent by the cost of each book to find the total number of books.

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost per book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by 4 to find out how many books each child got.

Number of books per child = Total number of books / Number of children
Number of books per child = 20 / 4
Number of books per child = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. This principle states that for two sets A and B, the size of the union of A and B is equal to the sum of the sizes of A and B, minus the size of their intersection.

Let's denote the set of kids allergic to dairy as D, the set of kids allergic to peanuts as P, and the set of kids allergic to both as B.

We know that |D| = 9, |P| = 6, and |B| = 3.

We want to find the number of kids that are not allergic to anything, which is equal to the total number of kids minus the number of kids allergic to at least one thing.

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can calculate the number of kids allergic to at least one thing as:

|D ∪ P| = |D| + |P| - |B|
= 9 + 6 - 3
= 12

However, this counts the kids allergic to both twice, so we need to subtract the number of kids allergic to both:

|D ∪ P| = 12 - 3
= 9

Now, we can find the number of kids not allergic to anything by subtracting the number of kids allergic to at least one thing from the total number of kids:

Number of kids not allergic to anything = Total number of kids - Number of kids allergic to at least one thing
= 32 - 9
= 23

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to calculate the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides.

First, let's calculate the total number of employees: 
There are 3 groups of 200 employees each, so the total number of employees is 3 * 200 = 600.

Next, let's calculate the total number of tour guides: 
There are 3 groups, and each group has 7 tour guides, so the total number of tour guides is 3 * 7 = 21.

Now, we add the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides to find the total number of people going on the tour: 
600 (employees) + 21 (tour guides) = 621.

The final answer is: 621"
"To determine the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. To find the increased price, we need to calculate 20% of $1500 and add it to the normal price.

20% of $1500 is 0.20 * $1500 = $300. Adding this to the normal price gives us $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel, which is $10,000 + $5400 = $16,400.

The final answer is: $16,400"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of tubes of blue and yellow paint Jasper has. 

Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, and since Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint, Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, and since Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint, Jasper has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

To find the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to add the number of blue and yellow tubes. 

Total tubes of paint Jasper has = 2 (blue) + 9 (yellow) = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the weight of the 2010 penny. Since it is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight as follows:

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * Weight of 1959 penny
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48
Weight of 2010 penny = 36

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their individual weights:

Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny
Combined weight = 48 + 36
Combined weight = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"To determine how much more they need to earn, we must first calculate the total amount they have already earned. Keegan earned $83 and Tasha earned $91, so together they have earned $83 + $91 = $174.

Since their goal is to raise $200, we subtract the amount they have already earned from the goal to find out how much more they need to earn: $200 - $174 = $26.

Therefore, they need to earn $26 more to reach their goal.

The final answer is: $26"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of songs each person can add to their player. 

Gabriel has 20 songs on his player, and it can store up to 100 songs. Therefore, the number of songs Gabriel can add to his player is 100 - 20 = 80.

Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, so Luri has 3 * 20 = 60 songs on his player. Since his player can also store up to 100 songs, the number of songs Luri can add to his player is 100 - 60 = 40.

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add to his player than Gabriel can add to his, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add: 80 - 40 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many oranges Stetson ate and then multiply that by the amount he gave up for each orange.

First, let's find out how many oranges Stetson ate. They picked 60 oranges and Stetson ate 2/5 of them. 

To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and then divide by 5.

60 * 2 = 120
120 / 5 = 24

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges.

Now, we know that Stetson gave up $10 for each orange. To find the total amount of money he gave up, we multiply the number of oranges he ate by the amount he gave up for each orange.

24 * 10 = 240

The final answer is: $240"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the cost of Jillian's handbag in relation to the cost of her shoes. 

Let's denote the cost of the shoes as S and the cost of the handbag as B. We are given that the cost of the shoes is $80, so S = 80.

The problem states that the handbag cost $20 less than 3 times as much as her shoes cost. This can be expressed as B = 3S - 20.

Substituting the value of S into the equation, we get B = 3(80) - 20.

First, we multiply 3 by 80 to get 240. Then, we subtract 20 from 240 to get 220.

Therefore, the cost of Jillian's handbag is $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of miles James runs in a week and then divide that by his speed.

First, let's calculate the total number of miles James runs in a week. He runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week, so:

12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Next, we need to divide the total number of miles by his speed to find the total number of hours he runs in a week. His speed is 10 miles per hour, so:

60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week

Therefore, James runs 6 hours a week.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of oats consumed by the horses per day and then multiply it by the number of days.

First, let's calculate the total amount of oats consumed by the horses per day. Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and there are 2 meals per day, so each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day. Since there are 4 horses, the total amount of oats consumed per day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

Now, we need to multiply the total amount of oats consumed per day by the number of days to find the total amount of oats needed for 5 days. 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we need to divide the total amount of oats needed by the weight of one bag to find the number of bags needed. 200 / 50 = 4.

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for 5 days.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the number of girl Pomeranians, we first need to determine the total number of Pomeranians. Since two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can calculate this as follows:

Total puppies = 27
Pomeranians = (2/3) * Total puppies
Pomeranians = (2/3) * 27
Pomeranians = 18

Now, we need to find the number of girl Pomeranians, which is one-third of the total Pomeranians:

Girl Pomeranians = (1/3) * Pomeranians
Girl Pomeranians = (1/3) * 18
Girl Pomeranians = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the average highest temperature, we need to add the highest temperatures of the three countries and divide by 3.

First, let's add the temperatures: -48 + 21 - 3 = -30.

The average highest temperature of the three countries is -10 degrees Fahrenheit."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the remaining amount of money the child needs to save and then divide it by the daily savings amount.

The toy car costs $12, and the child already has $4. So, the remaining amount he needs to save is $12 - $4 = $8.

The child promises to save $2 daily from his allowance. To find out how many days it will take him to save the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by the daily savings: $8 / $2 = 4 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of eggs that can be placed on the two trays and then subtract that from the total number of eggs Jaime has.

Each tray can hold 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays. So, the total number of eggs that can be placed on the trays is 24 * 2 = 48.

Jaime has 64 eggs, and 48 can be placed on the trays. To find out how many eggs won't be able to be placed, we subtract 48 from 64: 64 - 48 = 16.

Therefore, 16 eggs won't be able to be placed on the trays.

"To determine the total amount Sally spends, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza first. Since it costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, and the small pizza costs $8, the family-size pizza costs 3 * $8 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of the small pizza to the cost of the family-size pizza to find the total amount spent. $8 (small pizza) + $24 (family-size pizza) = $32.

The final numerical answer is: $32"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total cost of the razors after the sale and then divide that by the total number of razors.

Since Heather buys 2 packs of razors, she gets 2 packs * 4 razors per pack = 8 razors.

The original price of 2 packs of razors is 2 * $4.00 = $8.00. However, since they are on sale for buy one get one free, she only pays for 1 pack, which is $4.00.

She also has a $2.00 coupon, so the final cost of the 2 packs of razors is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Now, we need to find the cost of each individual razor. Since she bought 2 packs, which is 8 razors, the cost per razor is $2.00 / 8 = $0.25 per razor.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each level and add them together.

The 4 girls on the bottom are 64"" tall each, so their total height is 4 * 64 = 256"".

The 3 girls on top of the 4 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 3 * 64 = 192"".

The 2 girls on top of the 3 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 2 * 64 = 128"".

The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

To find the total height of the pyramid, we add the heights of each level together: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 536"".

Since the question asks for the height in feet, we need to convert the total height from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we divide 536 by 12 to get the total height in feet: 536 / 12 = 44.67.

The final answer is: 44.67"
"To find the total number of minutes Charisma walked, we need to calculate the total number of 5-minute breaks she took in a day and then multiply it by the number of days she worked.

Charisma works 8 hours a day, and she takes a 5-minute break every hour. So, the total number of breaks she takes in a day is 8 hours * 1 break per hour = 8 breaks.

Since each break is 5 minutes long, the total number of minutes she walked in a day is 8 breaks * 5 minutes per break = 40 minutes.

Charisma worked for 5 days, so the total number of minutes she walked is 40 minutes per day * 5 days = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"To solve this problem, we can start by representing the information given in the question. Let's denote Brett's current age as B and Angela's current age as A.

We know that Brett is 14 years old, so B = 14.

In four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. This can be represented as:

A + 4 = 3 * B

Since we know B = 14, we can substitute this value into the equation:

A + 4 = 3 * 14

Now, we can solve for A:

A + 4 = 42

Subtract 4 from both sides:

A = 38

So, Angela is currently 38 years old.

The final answer is: 38"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the morning rides and the total cost of the afternoon rides, then add them together.

The cost of the morning rides is the cost per ride multiplied by the number of rides. Since Paul drives twice a day for 14 days, he drives a total of 2 * 14 = 28 rides in the morning. The cost per ride is $6, so the total cost of the morning rides is 28 * $6 = $168.

The cost of the afternoon rides is also the cost per ride multiplied by the number of rides. Since Paul drives twice a day for 14 days, he drives a total of 2 * 14 = 28 rides in the afternoon. The cost per ride is $2, so the total cost of the afternoon rides is 28 * $2 = $56.

To find the total cost of driving his car during these two weeks, we add the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides: $168 + $56 = $224.

The final answer is: $224"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of oranges both Ashley and Brianne brought and then divide that number by the number of oranges required for one pie.

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so she brought 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she brought 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

The total number of oranges they brought is 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, the number of pies they can make is 120 / 3 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation representing the total cost for each venue. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'.

For the first venue, the total cost is the flat fee of $200 plus the cost of food for each guest, which is $5x. So, the total cost for the first venue is 200 + 5x.

For the second venue, the total cost is the cost per guest, which is $25x, since food is already included.

To find the number of guests for which the two venues are equal in cost, we set the two equations equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtracting 5x from both sides gives us:

200 = 20x

Dividing both sides by 20 gives us:

10 = x

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10. 

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknown quantities. Let's say David found x insects. Since Lily found 7 more than David, Lily found x + 7 insects. 

We are also given that David found half of what Bodhi found. This means Bodhi found 2x insects, since David found half of that amount. 

The total number of insects collected is 43, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 7) + 2x = 43. 

Combining like terms, we get 4x + 7 = 43. Subtracting 7 from both sides, we get 4x = 36. Dividing both sides by 4, we get x = 9.

Since Lily found x + 7 insects, and x = 9, Lily found 9 + 7 = 16 insects.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total amount of yarn used, we need to calculate the amount used by Mariah and her grandma separately and then add them together.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein. To find 1/4 of 364, we multiply 364 by 1/4.

1/4 * 364 = 364 / 4 = 91 yards

Mariah used 91 yards of yarn.

Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein, which is twice as much as Mariah used. So, we multiply 91 by 2.

91 * 2 = 182 yards

Her grandma used 182 yards of yarn.

Now, we add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma together.

91 + 182 = 273 yards

They used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

The final answer is: 273"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of gifts Cherrie bought for her friends and then add the 10 random gifts she decided to get.

First, let's calculate the total number of gifts for Cherrie's friends. 2 friends want 5 gifts each, so that's 2 x 5 = 10 gifts. The other 3 friends want 2 gifts each, so that's 3 x 2 = 6 gifts. 

Now, let's add the gifts for the 2 friends and the 3 friends: 10 + 6 = 16 gifts.

Cherrie also decided to get 10 more random gifts. 

So, the total number of gifts Cherrie bought is 16 (for her friends) + 10 (random gifts) = 26.

The final answer is: 26"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know the chair is 3 feet wide. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so the rug's width is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

Next, we are told the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. Adding 2 feet to this gives us the length of the couch: 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as 'x'. Since Suzie bought two packs of strawberry gum, the total cost for these packs would be 2x.

She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum. 

She also bought a small pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum, which is $2 / 2 = $1.

The total cost of all the gum packs is $7. So, we can set up the equation: 2x + 2 + 1 = 7.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x + 3 = 7.

Subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation, we get: 2x = 4.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get: x = 2.

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine which type of wood Frederick should buy to maximize the number of popsicle sticks he can make while staying within his budget of $24.

Let's analyze the options:

- A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and yields 200 sticks.
- A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and yields 400 sticks.

Since Frederick wants to buy the cheapest lumber, he should buy the 2 x 4 piece of wood. However, we need to check if he can afford to buy more than one 2 x 4 piece of wood.

If he buys one 2 x 4 piece of wood, he will spend $4 and have $20 left. With this remaining amount, he can buy one more 2 x 4 piece of wood, which will cost him another $4, leaving him with $16. He can't buy another 2 x 4 piece of wood with this amount, but he can buy a 2 x 8 piece of wood for $6, which is more than he has left.

However, if he buys two 2 x 4 pieces of wood, he will have 400 sticks (200 from the first 2 x 4 and 200 from the second 2 x 4). 

Now, let's calculate the total number of sticks he can make if he buys two 2 x 4 pieces of wood:

400 (from the first 2 x 4) + 200 (from the second 2 x 4) = 600

So, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make if he buys the cheapest lumber is 600."
"To determine the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs, we need to calculate the total number of snowshoes required and then multiply it by the cost per pair.

Each dog has 4 legs, and since Mario has 6 dogs, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24.

Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, the total number of snowshoes required is 24 / 2 = 12 (because each pair consists of 2 snowshoes).

The cost per pair of snowshoes is $12.00. Therefore, the total cost for 12 pairs of snowshoes is 12 * $12.00 = $144.00.

The final numerical answer is: $144.00"
"To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week and then subtract the cost of the weekly pass.

Janet takes two bus trips per day, five days a week. So, the total number of bus trips per week is 2 * 5 = 10.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost of her bus trips for a week is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

The weekly bus pass costs $20. To find out how much Janet would save, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of her bus trips: $22 - $20 = $2.

Therefore, Janet would save $2 by buying a weekly bus pass.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of cows and sheep at each location. 

Since the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, and the farm has 30 cows, the zoo must have 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm must have 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo. The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, for a total of 30 + 10 = 40 animals. The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, for a total of 60 + 20 = 80 animals.

The total number of animals at the farm and the zoo combined is 40 + 80 = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can let x be the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. 

We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, so the total number of items Rose bought is 12 + 4 = 16. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of items Sophia bought, we can set up the equation 4x = 16.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 16 / 4 = 4.

This means Sophia bought 4 onions and 4 potatoes. To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add the number of onions and potatoes: 4 + 4 = 8.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of days Andy has to reach his goal and then determine the total number of calories he needs to burn. 

First, let's calculate the number of days Andy has to reach his goal. His birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. 

December has 31 days, January has 31 days, February has 28 days (assuming a non-leap year), March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and July has 19 days. 

Total days = 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 211 days

Now, let's calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to reach his goal. He wants to lose 30 pounds, and he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound. 

Total calories to burn = 30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories

Now, let's calculate the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal. 

Daily calorie deficit = Total calories to burn / Total days = 105,000 calories / 211 days ≈ 498 calories/day

The final answer is: 498"
"This question appears to be a simple arithmetic problem, but it also touches on the concept of the difference between income and expenditure, which is a fundamental idea in the philosophy of economics, particularly in the context of the concept of ""use value"" and ""exchange value"" as discussed by Karl Marx.

However, to solve the problem, we need to focus on the arithmetic aspect. 

Gerald earns $30 per day. To find out how much he earns in a week, we need to multiply his daily earnings by 7 (the number of days in a week).

$30 * 7 = $210

Gerald spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we need to subtract his expenditure from his total earnings.

$210 - $100 = $110

Therefore, Gerald has $110 left."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Hannah will run and then multiply it by the amount of water she needs to drink per kilometer.

First, let's calculate the total distance Hannah will run. Since each lap is 0.25 km and she needs to run 8 laps, the total distance is:

Total distance = Number of laps * Distance per lap
Total distance = 8 * 0.25 km
Total distance = 2 km

Now, we know Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. To find out how much water she needs to drink in total, we multiply the total distance by the amount of water per kilometer:

Total water needed = Total distance * Water per kilometer
Total water needed = 2 km * 60 ml/km
Total water needed = 120 ml

"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps.

Initially, Julie had $500. 

First, she spent 20% of $500 on clothes. To find 20% of $500, we multiply 500 by 0.20. 
20% of $500 = 500 * 0.20 = $100

Now, Julie has $500 - $100 = $400 left.

Next, she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs. To find 25% of $400, we multiply 400 by 0.25.
25% of $400 = 400 * 0.25 = $100

Now, Julie has $400 - $100 = $300 left.

The final answer is: $300"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic reasoning. Let's denote the cost of the lot as 'x'. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house can be represented as 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot together is $120,000, so we can set up the equation: x + 3x = 120,000.

Combining like terms, we get 4x = 120,000.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 120,000 / 4 = 30,000.

Since the cost of the house is three times the cost of the lot, the cost of the house is 3x = 3 * 30,000 = 90,000.

The final answer is: $90,000"
"To determine the profit earned by Tara, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue from the sale of the canvas bags.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags. Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each. Since each pack contains 5 bags, the total number of bags is 8 packs * 5 bags/pack = 40 bags. The total cost is 40 bags * $4/bag = $160.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from the sale of the canvas bags. Tara sold each bag for $8. Since she sold 40 bags, the total revenue is 40 bags * $8/bag = $320.

Now, we can calculate the profit earned by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost = $320 - $160 = $160.

The final answer is: $160"
"To determine the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to calculate the total time of the fight and then multiply it by the average number of punches he throws per minute.

The fight lasts for 5 rounds of 3 minutes each, so the total time is 5 * 3 = 15 minutes.

Since Joe throws 25 punches per minute, the total number of punches he threw is 15 * 25 = 375.

The final answer is: 375"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Suzanne made 36 cookies. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, we can calculate Josh's cookies as follows:

Josh's cookies = (1/4) * Suzanne's cookies
= (1/4) * 36
= 9

Now, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So, we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
= 2 * 9
= 18

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies.

18"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Ali has: 
   Ali has 4 $10 bills and 6 $20 bills. 
   The total amount of money from $10 bills is 4 * $10 = $40.
   The total amount of money from $20 bills is 6 * $20 = $120.
   The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

2. Calculate the amount of money Ali gives to his sister:
   Ali gives his sister half of the total money he has, which is 1/2 * $160 = $80.

3. Calculate the amount of money Ali has after giving his sister $80:
   The amount of money Ali has left is $160 - $80 = $80.

4. Calculate the amount of money Ali uses to buy dinner:
   Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner, which is 3/5 * $80 = $48.

5. Calculate the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner:
   The amount of money Ali has left after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

The final answer is: $32"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how long it takes Rob to shingle a house in minutes. Since Rob takes 2 hours, we need to convert this to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 hours is equal to 2 x 60 = 120 minutes.

Now, we are told that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. Double the time it takes Rob is 2 x 120 = 240 minutes. Adding 40 minutes to this gives us 240 + 40 = 280 minutes.

Therefore, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house.

"To determine the total number of skeins of wool Martha needs, we must calculate the total number of skeins required for each item and then sum them up.

For each grandchild, Martha needs:
- 2 skeins for a hat
- 4 skeins for a scarf
- 12 skeins for a sweater
- 1 skein for a pair of mittens
- 2 skeins for a pair of socks

Total skeins per child: 2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2 = 19

Since there are 3 grandchildren, we multiply the total skeins per child by 3:
19 * 3 = 57

Therefore, Martha needs to buy 57 skeins of wool."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Chris starts with 100 math problems to complete.
2. On Monday, he completes 12 problems, so he has 100 - 12 = 88 problems left.
3. On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems. So, he now has 88 - 36 = 52 problems left.
4. On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining problems, which is 52 / 4 = 13 problems. So, he now has 52 - 13 = 39 problems left.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of quarts each person can pick per hour and then add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.

Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

To find the total number of quarts they can pick per hour, we add the number of quarts each person can pick: 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29.

The final answer is: 29"
"To determine the number of loaves of bread left, we need to calculate the total number of loaves sold and subtract that from the initial number of loaves baked.

The bakers sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon, so the total number of loaves sold is 93 + 39 = 132.

However, the grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves, which means these loaves should be added back to the total number of loaves sold. But since we are calculating the number of loaves left, we should subtract the total number of loaves sold from the initial number of loaves baked.

So, the number of loaves left is 200 - 132 = 68.

The number of loaves of bread left is 68."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of rows of each type of tulip Jackson can plant and then find the least common multiple (LCM) of the two numbers, as this will give us the total number of rows he can plant.

First, let's find the maximum number of rows of each type of tulip:

- Red tulips: 36 / 6 = 6 rows
- Blue tulips: 24 / 8 = 3 rows

Now, we need to find the LCM of 6 and 3. The multiples of 6 are 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, etc. The multiples of 3 are 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, etc. The smallest number that appears in both lists is 6, so the LCM of 6 and 3 is 6.

However, since we are looking for the total number of rows, we need to consider the actual number of tulips of each color that Jackson has. 

- Red tulips: 36 / 6 = 6 rows
- Blue tulips: 24 / 8 = 3 rows

Since 6 is greater than 3, the limiting factor is the blue tulips, which can only be planted in 3 rows. Therefore, Jackson can plant a total of 3 rows of flowers.

The final answer is: 3"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cups of raisins Heather will use for each of the three items and then calculate how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make.

First, let's find out how many cups of raisins Heather will use for each item. Since she divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, we can divide the total number of cups of raisins (27) by 3.

27 cups / 3 = 9 cups per item

Now, we know that a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the number of cups of raisins she has for oatmeal cookies (9) by the amount of raisins needed for one batch (3/4 cup).

To divide 9 by 3/4, we can multiply 9 by the reciprocal of 3/4, which is 4/3.

9 * (4/3) = 12

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we first need to calculate her daily and weekly electric consumption before and after adding the new device.

Before adding the new device, Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, her daily consumption is 12 * 24 = 288 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day.

After adding the new device, her daily consumption will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour. So, her daily consumption will be 14 * 24 = 336 kWh per day.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7. 

Before adding the new device, Ada's weekly consumption is 288 * 7 = 2016 kWh.
After adding the new device, her weekly consumption is 336 * 7 = 2352 kWh.

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kWh. So, the weekly cost before adding the new device is 2016 * $1.50 = $3024.
The weekly cost after adding the new device is 2352 * $1.50 = $3528.

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $3528 - $3024 = $504.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, let's determine how long it would take one person to paint a whole house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, it would take them twice as long to paint a whole house, which is 10 days.

Next, we need to find out how many hours it would take for one person to paint a whole house. There are 24 hours in a day, so 10 days would be 10 x 24 = 240 hours.

Now, we need to find out how long it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house. If one person can paint a whole house in 240 hours, 5 people can paint a whole house in 240 / 5 = 48 hours.

The final answer is: 48"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of chairs Ophelia and Jenna have. Since Ophelia has 20 sofas and she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can calculate the number of chairs Ophelia has by adding 2 to the number of sofas she has.

Ophelia's chairs = Ophelia's sofas + 2
Ophelia's chairs = 20 + 2
Ophelia's chairs = 22

Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, we can calculate the number of chairs Jenna has by multiplying the number of chairs Ophelia has by 3.

Jenna's chairs = 3 * Ophelia's chairs
Jenna's chairs = 3 * 22
Jenna's chairs = 66

Now that we know the number of chairs each person has, we can calculate the total number of chairs.

Total chairs = Ophelia's chairs + Jenna's chairs
Total chairs = 22 + 66
Total chairs = 88

We also know that Ophelia has 20 sofas. To find the total number of sofas, we don't need to do any additional calculations since we already know the number of sofas Ophelia has.

Total sofas = 20

To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we add the total number of sofas and chairs together.

Total sofas and chairs = Total sofas + Total chairs
Total sofas and chairs = 20 + 88
Total sofas and chairs = 108

The final answer is: 108"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Tom spent on the headphone set. We can do this by subtracting the cost of the CD from the total amount he paid.

Total amount paid = $48
Cost of CD = $4
Cost of headphone set = Total amount paid - Cost of CD
= $48 - $4
= $44

Now that we know the cost of the headphone set, we can find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with that amount.

Cost of one CD = $4
Number of CDs Tom could have bought with the cost of the headphone set = Cost of headphone set / Cost of one CD
= $44 / $4
= 11

So, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to consider the weeks where he spent 4 hours, 5 hours, and 6 hours. 

First, let's find the total hours spent in the weeks where he spent 4 hours. Since there are 8 weeks, and we don't know how many weeks he spent 4 hours, we'll call the number of weeks he spent 4 hours 'x'. The number of weeks he spent 5 hours is 2, and the number of weeks he spent 6 hours is 1.

We know that the total number of weeks is 8, so we can set up the equation: x + 2 + 1 = 8. Solving for x, we get x = 5.

Now, we can find the total hours spent in each type of week: 
- 4 hours/week * 5 weeks = 20 hours
- 5 hours/week * 2 weeks = 10 hours
- 6 hours/week * 1 week = 6 hours

Adding these up, we get 20 + 10 + 6 = 36 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is 48 - 8 = 40.

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (which is 8) get into the bus. This means 5 * 8 = 40 people get in. So, the total number of people on the bus after the first stop is 40 (left) + 40 (got in) = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is 80 - 21 = 59.

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. Since 21 got off, 3 times fewer would be 21 / 3 = 7. So, 7 people get in. The total number of people on the bus after the second stop is 59 (left) + 7 (got in) = 66.

The final answer is: 66"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.
2. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. Let's denote Jame's age in 8 years as J8 and his cousin's age in 8 years as C8. We can express this relationship as C8 = 2J8 - 5.
3. Since Jame's age in 8 years will be 22 + 8 = 30, we can substitute J8 = 30 into the equation from step 2: C8 = 2(30) - 5 = 55.
4. Now we know Jame's cousin's age in 8 years will be 55. To find Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 from 55: 55 - 8 = 47.
5. The age difference between Jame and his cousin is the difference between their current ages: 47 - 22 = 25.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, we know that the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. We also know that the computer and the printer together cost $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. 

To find the cost of the 2 monitors, we subtract the cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

Since there are 2 monitors, we divide the cost of the 2 monitors by 2 to find the cost of one monitor: $600 / 2 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of shells brought by the boys and then calculate the number of shells brought by the girls.

Since there are 10 boys (half of 20 kids) and each boy brought 60 shells, the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + 4 * 60 shells.

First, calculate four times the number of shells brought by the boys: 4 * 60 = 240.

Then, add the number of shells brought by the boys to this result: 600 + 240 = 840.

Since there are 10 girls (half of 20 kids), the number of shells brought by each girl is 840 / 10 = 84.

The final answer is: 84"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps.

Initially, let's denote the number of candies George had before eating 5 candies as 'x'. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick had 2x candies.

After George ate 5 candies, he was left with x - 5 candies.

We are given that George now has 3 candies left, so we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 3.

To find the value of x, we can add 5 to both sides of the equation: x = 3 + 5, which gives us x = 8.

Now that we know George had 8 candies initially, we can find the number of candies Nick had: 2x = 2 * 8 = 16.

Therefore, Nick has 16 candies.

"To determine how many vlogs Emma should make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we need to calculate the total number of vlogs she has already made and subtract that from the target of 72.

In the first week, Emma made 18 vlogs.
In the second week, Emma made 21 vlogs.
In the third week, Emma made 15 vlogs.

Total vlogs made so far = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Since Emma aims to make 72 vlogs per month, we subtract the total vlogs made so far from the target:

72 (target) - 54 (vlogs made so far) = 18

Therefore, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete her target of 72 vlogs per month.

20% of $50 can be calculated as 0.20 * $50 = $10.

Now, we add the tip to the dinner bill: $50 (dinner bill) + $10 (tip) = $60.

Since your wife wants to split the check evenly, you will pay half of the total amount. 

Half of $60 is $60 / 2 = $30.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, $18 is shared among 3 boys. This means each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy added $5 to his share, so he now has $6 + $5 = $11.

The following day, he added another $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

He then spent $8, so he has $21 - $8 = $13 left.

After saving some more, he tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8. This means he now has 3 * $13 = $39.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much Elvis needs to save in the first half of the month. Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, we can set up an equation to represent the situation.

Let x be the amount Elvis saves in the first half of the month. Then, 2x is the amount he saves in the second half of the month.

The total amount Elvis needs to save is $1125, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 1125

Combine like terms:

3x = 1125

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 375

So Elvis needs to save $375 in the first half of the month.

Since the first half of the month has 15 days (April 1-15), we can calculate the daily savings for the first half:

Daily savings in the first half = 375 / 15
= 25

Now, we know that Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as he saves in the first half. Therefore, the daily savings in the second half will be:

Daily savings in the second half = 2 * 25
= 50

"This problem can be approached using algebra. Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as 'x'. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff's share can be represented as 4x.

The total amount of money they are dividing is $100. Therefore, the sum of their shares should equal $100. We can write this as an equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Now, divide both sides by 5 to solve for x:

x = 20

Since x represents the amount Brad gets, and Jeff gets 4 times as much, Jeff's share is 4x:

Jeff's share = 4x = 4 * 20 = 80

The final answer is: $80"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Jeff walks in a week. Since he walks to work and back each day, the distance he walks in a day is 2 times the distance to work, which is 2 * 3 = 6 miles.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, which means she writes 26 letters each time. So, she writes 26 * 2 = 52 letters.

2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of the alphabet is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.

3. So far, Elise has written 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

4. Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written. This means she re-writes 65 letters.

5. To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we add the letters she wrote initially (52) to the letters she wrote in the second step (13) and the letters she re-wrote (65). 

Total letters = 52 + 13 + 65 = 130

"This problem can be approached using the concept of exponential growth, which is reminiscent of the S-curve in the philosophy of complexity and systems theory. However, in this case, it's more closely related to the concept of geometric progression.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. In the first round, Ali calls 3 families directly.
2. In the second round, each of the 3 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families being notified.
3. In the third round, each of the 9 families (from the second round) calls 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families being notified.
4. In the fourth round, each of the 27 families (from the third round) calls 3 other families, resulting in 27 * 3 = 81 new families being notified.

However, we must also consider the families that were notified in the previous rounds. In the fourth round, the 3 families from the first round will also call 3 other families each, adding 3 * 3 = 9 new families. Additionally, the 9 families from the second round will also call 3 other families each, adding 9 * 3 = 27 new families. The 27 families from the third round will also call 3 other families each, adding 27 * 3 = 81 new families.

To find the total number of families notified in the fourth round, we need to add the new families from the fourth round (81) to the families notified in the previous rounds (3 + 9 + 27). However, this is not the correct approach, as it counts the families notified in previous rounds multiple times.

A more accurate approach is to consider the total number of families notified in the previous rounds as the base for the fourth round. In the fourth round, the 3 families from the first round will call 3 other families each, the 9 families from the second round will call 3 other families each, and the 27 families from the third round will call 3 other families each. This results in a total of (3 + 9 + 27) * 3 = 39 * 3 = 117 new families. However, this is still not the correct answer.

The correct approach is to consider the total number of families notified in the previous rounds as the base for the fourth round. In the fourth round, the 3 families from the first round will call 3 other families each, the 9 families from the second round will call 3 other families each, and the 27 families from the third round will call 3 other families each. This results in a total of (3 + 9 + 27) * 3 = 39 * 3 = 117 new families. However, we also need to add the 81 families that were notified in the third round. The correct answer is 117 + 81 = 198."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple mathematical approach. Let's denote Mark's initial weight as 'x'. Since Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, the total weight lost is 10 * 3 = 30 pounds.

We know that Mark's final weight is 70 pounds, so his initial weight can be found by adding the weight lost to the final weight. Therefore, the equation becomes:

x - 30 = 70

To find the initial weight, we need to isolate 'x' by adding 30 to both sides of the equation:

x = 70 + 30
x = 100

So, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds.

The final answer is: 100"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of toys in the sorted play set that is five times larger than James's play set. Since James's play set has 80 toys, a play set five times larger would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys.

Since Jonathan needs 2 more toys to have enough toys to make a play set five times larger than James's, he must have 400 - 2 toys. To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to subtract 2 from 400.

Jonathan currently has 400 - 2 = 398 toys.

The final answer is: 398"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy before applying the discount, and then apply the 10% discount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items:

- 5 notebooks at $1.50 each: 5 * $1.50 = $7.50
- 2 pens at $0.25 each: 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
- 1 calculator at $12 each: 1 * $12 = $12
- 1 geometry set at $10 each: 1 * $10 = $10

Total cost before discount: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30

Now, let's apply the 10% discount:

Discount amount: 10% of $30 = 0.10 * $30 = $3

Total cost after discount: $30 - $3 = $27

Therefore, Daniel has to spend $27 on all the items he wants to buy.

The final answer is: $27"
"To determine the total cost of Carly's order, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

The cost of five hamburgers at $4 each is 5 x $4 = $20.
The cost of ten packs of potato fries at $0.30 each is 10 x $0.30 = $3.
The cost of five cans of fruit drinks at $2 each is 5 x $2 = $10.

Now, let's add the costs together: $20 + $3 + $10 = $33.

Carly pays with a $50 bill, so to find the change, we subtract the total cost from the $50 bill: $50 - $33 = $17.

The final answer is: $17"
"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down her sales into two parts: the first $1000 and the sales above $1000.

For the first $1000, she earns a 30% commission:
$1000 * 0.30 = $300

For the sales above $1000, which is $2500 - $1000 = $1500, she earns an additional 10% commission:
$1500 * 0.10 = $150

Now, we add the two amounts together to find her total earnings:
$300 + $150 = $450

Therefore, Antonella earned $450.

The final answer is: $450"
"To determine the number of additional bottles Bill needs to buy, we must first calculate the total number of bottles he already has and the total number of bottles he needs.

Bill has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each, so he has a total of 2 * 24 = 48 bottles.

Since he wants 2 bottles for each of the 70 guests, he needs a total of 70 * 2 = 140 bottles.

To find out how many additional bottles he needs, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs: 140 - 48 = 92.

Therefore, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water.

The final answer is: 92"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the time it takes for Ray to swim a mile in cold water as C, and the time it takes for Ray to swim a mile in warm water as W.

We are given that C = 16 minutes.

We are also given that W = 2 minutes more than twice as long as C. This can be expressed as W = 2C + 2.

Substituting the value of C, we get W = 2(16) + 2 = 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Now, we need to find the time it takes for Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day and on a hot day.

Time to swim 3 miles on a cold day = 3C = 3(16) = 48 minutes.

Time to swim 3 miles on a hot day = 3W = 3(34) = 102 minutes.

The difference in time = 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub. Since it costs thrice as much as the foot-long fish sub, and the foot-long fish sub costs $40, we can calculate the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub as follows:

Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub = 3 * Cost of foot-long fish sub
= 3 * $40
= $120

Now, we need to find the total cost of both subs. 

Total cost = Cost of foot-long fish sub + Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub
= $40 + $120
= $160

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the buttons with four holes.

First, let's find the number of buttons with four holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 buttons have two holes, the number of buttons with four holes is 21 - 7 = 14.

Now, let's calculate the total number of holes in the buttons with two holes: 7 buttons * 2 holes/button = 14 holes.

Next, let's calculate the total number of holes in the buttons with four holes: 14 buttons * 4 holes/button = 56 holes.

Finally, let's add the total number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the buttons with four holes: 14 holes + 56 holes = 70 holes.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many cups of coffee Juan currently drinks. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, and Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, we need to know the daily recommended amount of coffee.

Let's assume the daily recommended amount of coffee is x cups. Then, Octavia drinks x/2 cups, and Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups.

We are told that Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. To find out how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we need to subtract the recommended amount from his current intake:

5x - 4 = ?

Since we don't know the value of x, we can express the answer in terms of x. However, we can also express the answer in terms of the number of cups Octavia drinks, which is x/2. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, we can express his current intake as 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups.

We are given that Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to 4 cups. To find out how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we need to subtract the recommended amount from his current intake:

5x - 4

However, we are also given that Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount of coffee. If we assume the daily recommended amount of coffee is 4 cups, then Octavia drinks 4/2 = 2 cups. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, Juan drinks 10 * 2 = 20 cups.

To find out how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we can subtract the recommended amount from his current intake:

20 - 4 = 16

"To determine the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of hamsters: 3 cages with 10 hamsters each will be 3 * 10 = 30 hamsters.

Next, let's calculate the number of guinea pigs: 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each will be 3 * 5 = 15 guinea pigs.

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs together to get the total number of rodents: 30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45 rodents.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the average weight of the three friends, we need to first determine their individual weights. 

Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds. 
Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so Susan's weight is 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. 
Bob's weight is twice as much as Susan's, so Bob's weight is 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we can find the average weight by adding the weights of all three friends and dividing by 3. 
Average weight = (Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight) / 3 
= (150 + 130 + 260) / 3 
= 540 / 3 
= 180

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total angle the sun will be above the ground after 10 hours. 

The initial angle of the sun relative to the ground is 0 degrees (since it's at the tip of the pyramid), and it moves 5 degrees per hour. 

After 10 hours, the sun will have moved 10 * 5 = 50 degrees above the ground.

However, we also need to consider the angle of the pyramid itself, which is 32 degrees. Since the sun is moving upward from the pyramid, we need to add this angle to the total angle of the sun above the ground.

So, the total angle from the ground to the sun will be 50 + 32 = 82 degrees.

The final answer is: 82"
"To determine the number of candles James needs, we must first calculate the total number of candles required for both sons. Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Typically, birthday candles are used in the same number as the age of the person. Therefore, James needs 12 candles for the older son and 8 candles for the younger son, totaling 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total number of candles needed (20) by the number of candles per pack (5). 

20 / 5 = 4

Since James needs 4 packs of candles, and each pack costs $3, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack to find the total cost.

4 * 3 = 12

Therefore, James spends $12 on candles.

The final answer is: $12"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of pages Judy read in the first week and then add it to the number of pages she read in the second week.

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 7 * 15 = 105 minutes.

Given that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the number of pages she read in the first week as follows:

Number of pages read in the first week = (105 minutes / 1.5 minutes per page) * 2 pages per 1.5 minutes
= 105 / 1.5 * 2
= 140 pages

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

Therefore, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
140 pages (first week) + 100 pages (second week) = 240 pages

The final answer is: 240"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of sandwiches each person ate and then subtract that from the total number of sandwiches.

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which is 1/3 * 12 = 4 sandwiches.

Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which is 1/4 * 12 = 3 sandwiches.

The total number of sandwiches eaten is 4 (by Cody) + 3 (by Trevor) = 7 sandwiches.

To find the number of sandwiches left, we subtract the total eaten from the initial number: 12 - 7 = 5 sandwiches.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's denote the nephew's current age as 'x'. 

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be 44 + 7 = 51, and his nephew's age will be x + 7. According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This can be expressed as:

51 = 3(x + 7)

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. 

51 = 3x + 21

Subtract 21 from both sides:

30 = 3x

Divide both sides by 3:

10 = x

So, the nephew is 10 years old today.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, the tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth. 

Then, for the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as Sharon had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since Sharon received $1.00 for each of the previous three teeth, half of that is $0.50. So, for the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna. 

Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as M and the number of goals scored by Anna as A. 

We are given that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, so we can write an equation: R = M + 20, where R is the number of goals scored by Richie. 

We are also given that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, so we can write another equation: R = A + 45.

Since we know that Richie scored 80 goals, we can substitute this value into the first equation: 80 = M + 20. 

Solving for M, we get M = 80 - 20 = 60.

Now, we can substitute the value of R into the second equation: 80 = A + 45. 

Solving for A, we get A = 80 - 45 = 35.

Now that we know the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers: Total = R + M + A = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175.

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how much more money Mitchell made than Liam, we need to calculate the total amount of money each of them made and then subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings.

Liam made $63 in total. 

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece, so we multiply the number of lemonades by the price per lemonade: 21 * 4 = 84.

Now, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings: 84 - 63 = 21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Peter spent on wooden action figures and the total amount of money he has left to spend on plastic action figures.

From Sunday through Wednesday, Peter spent $5 each day on wooden action figures. Since there are 4 days in this period, he spent a total of 4 * $5 = $20 on wooden action figures.

Peter initially had $70. After spending $20 on wooden action figures, he has $70 - $20 = $50 left.

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Saturday), Peter will spend an equal amount each day on plastic action figures, which cost $2 each. Since there are 4 days in this period, he will spend a total of 4 * $2 = $8 on plastic action figures.

However, Peter only has $50 left, which is less than the $8 he needs to spend on plastic action figures. Therefore, he will not be able to buy 4 plastic action figures. Instead, he will be able to buy 3 plastic action figures with the remaining $50, since 3 * $2 = $6, and he will have $50 - $6 = $44 left over.

In total, Peter bought 4 wooden action figures and 3 plastic action figures, for a total of 4 + 3 = 7 action figures.

"To determine the total cost of the kitten, we need to calculate the cost of spaying, the cost of the vaccines, and the cost of the broken vases.

The cost of spaying the kitten is $200.

The cost of the vaccines is 3 vaccines * $20 each = $60.

The cost of the broken vases is 4 vases * $12 each = $48.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of spaying, the cost of the vaccines, and the cost of the broken vases: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

The final answer is: $308"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a month. 

First, let's calculate the total number of roses ordered per week: 
20 (first shop) + 15 (second shop) + 30 (third shop) = 65 roses per week.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the total number of roses ordered per week by 4:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month.

Ford grows 40 roses per week, so to find out how many roses he grows in a month, we multiply 40 by 4:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month.

Now, we subtract the total number of roses Ford grows in a month from the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops in a month to find out how many roses he lacks:
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month.

The final answer is: 100"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple mathematical formula. The amount of money remaining in the account after a certain period can be calculated by subtracting the total amount withdrawn from the initial amount.

First, let's calculate the total amount withdrawn in 2 years. There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are 24 months. 

Total amount withdrawn = Amount withdrawn per month * Number of months
Total amount withdrawn = $100 * 24
Total amount withdrawn = $2400

Now, let's subtract the total amount withdrawn from the initial amount to find the remaining amount in the account.

Remaining amount = Initial amount - Total amount withdrawn
Remaining amount = $3000 - $2400
Remaining amount = $600

The final answer is: $600"
"To calculate the net profit, we need to determine the total revenue and total cost.

The total revenue is the number of sandwiches sold multiplied by the price per sandwich. In this case, they sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each, so the total revenue is:

10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00

The total cost consists of the cost of bread and the cost of cheese and condiments. The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. So, the cost of bread per sandwich is:

$3.00/loaf / 10 sandwiches/loaf = $0.30/sandwich

The cost of cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches is $30.00, so the cost per sandwich is:

$30.00 / 10 sandwiches = $3.00/sandwich

The total cost per sandwich is the sum of the cost of bread and the cost of cheese and condiments:

$0.30/sandwich + $3.00/sandwich = $3.30/sandwich

Now, we can calculate the total cost for 10 sandwiches:

10 sandwiches * $3.30/sandwich = $33.00

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
= $70.00 - $33.00
= $37.00

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of muffin crayons Kate can make and then multiply that by the price per muffin crayon.

First, let's find the total number of crayon pieces. Since there are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of crayons per box:

3 boxes * 64 crayons/box = 192 crayon pieces

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one muffin crayon, we divide the total number of crayon pieces by 8 to find the number of muffin crayons:

192 crayon pieces / 8 pieces/muffin crayon = 24 muffin crayons

Now, we multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price per muffin crayon to find the total amount of money Kate can make:

24 muffin crayons * $1.50/muffin crayon = $36

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total area of the bedroom, the cost of the new carpet, the cost of the padding, the cost of removing the old carpet, and the cost of installing the new carpet.

First, let's calculate the area of the bedroom:

Area = Length x Width
Area = 18 feet x 12 feet
Area = 216 square feet

Next, let's calculate the cost of the new carpet:

Cost of new carpet = Area x Cost per square foot
Cost of new carpet = 216 square feet x $12 per square foot
Cost of new carpet = $2592

Now, let's calculate the cost of the padding:

Cost of padding = Area x Cost per square foot
Cost of padding = 216 square feet x $2 per square foot
Cost of padding = $432

Next, let's calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:

Cost of removing old carpet = Area x Cost per square foot
Cost of removing old carpet = 216 square feet x $4 per square foot
Cost of removing old carpet = $864

Finally, let's calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:

Cost of installing new carpet = Area x Cost per square foot
Cost of installing new carpet = 216 square feet x $34 per square foot
Cost of installing new carpet = $7344

Now, let's add up all the costs to find the total cost:

Total cost = Cost of new carpet + Cost of padding + Cost of removing old carpet + Cost of installing new carpet
Total cost = $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344
Total cost = $11332

"To solve this problem, we need to find the percentage by which the oven is off. We can do this by finding the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, and then dividing that by the set temperature.

The difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature is 468 - 450 = 18.

The percentage by which the oven is off is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Now, we need to find the temperature that Maggie should set the oven to in order to achieve 520 degrees. Let's call this temperature x. We know that the actual temperature will be 4% higher than the set temperature, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x * 0.04) = 520

Simplifying the equation, we get:

1.04x = 520

Dividing both sides by 1.04, we get:

x = 500

So, Maggie should set the oven to 500 degrees to achieve 520 degrees.

"To determine the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to calculate the total duration of both movies in minutes. 

First, let's convert the duration of the first movie into minutes: 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, so 1 hour and 30 minutes is equal to 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.

Next, let's convert the duration of the second movie into minutes: 2 hours is equal to 120 minutes, and adding 5 minutes to that gives us 125 minutes.

Now, we can add the durations of both movies to find the total time: 90 minutes (first movie) + 125 minutes (second movie) = 215 minutes.

The total time Max will spend watching the two movies is 215 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

To find the total number of utensils brought by the two, we need to add the number of cups and dishes brought by Judy and her friend.

Judy brought 12 + 24 = 36 utensils (12 cups + 24 dishes).
Her friend brought 40 + 44 = 84 utensils (40 cups + 44 dishes).

The total number of utensils brought by the two is 36 + 84 = 120.

"To find the cost per pair of contacts, we first need to determine the total number of contacts in two boxes and the total cost of two boxes with the discount.

Since each box contains 90 contacts and will last Pete 45 days, we can calculate the total number of contacts in two boxes as follows:

2 boxes * 90 contacts/box = 180 contacts

Since Pete will last 45 days on one box, two boxes will last him 2 * 45 = 90 days. 

To find the cost of two boxes with the 10% discount, we first calculate the original cost and then apply the discount:

Original cost of 2 boxes = 2 * $100 = $200
Discount = 10% of $200 = 0.1 * $200 = $20
Discounted cost of 2 boxes = $200 - $20 = $180

Now, to find the cost per pair of contacts, we divide the discounted cost of two boxes by the total number of contacts:

Cost per pair of contacts = $180 / 180 = $1

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total hours worked by both John and Jill, and then determine their respective earnings.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, for a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. Therefore, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Since they both earn $10 an hour, Jill's total earnings are 3 * $10 = $30, and John's total earnings are 7 * $10 = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total calories burned by Hannah during her activities and then determine the amount of water she needs to drink based on the given ratio.

First, let's calculate the total calories burned during aerobics: 
2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories

Next, let's calculate the total calories burned during running: 
1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Now, let's add the calories burned during both activities to get the total calories burned: 
1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units she burned: 
1600 calories / 200 calories = 8

Now, we multiply the number of 200-calorie units by the amount of water needed per unit: 
8 * 100 ml = 800 ml

The final answer is: 800"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G. 

From the given information, we have the following equations:

1. R = 0.99B (1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans)
2. G = 1.01B (1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans)
3. B + R + G = 4500 (total number of jelly beans)

Substituting equations 1 and 2 into equation 3, we get:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500
Combine like terms:
3B = 4500
Divide both sides by 3:
B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

To find the difference between the number of green and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to first find the third measurement. Jared's typing speed increased from 47 WPM to 52 WPM, which is an increase of 5 WPM. If he continues to increase his typing speed once more by 5 WPM, his new typing speed will be 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM.

Now, we can find the average of the three measurements: (47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the weight change over 5 weeks for both options and then find the difference.

Option 1: Eating Cheerios every day for breakfast
Weight change per week = -1.25 pounds
Weight change over 5 weeks = -1.25 * 5 = -6.25 pounds

Option 2: Eating donuts every day for breakfast
Weight change per week = 1.75 pounds
Weight change over 5 weeks = 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds

Now, let's find the difference in weight change between the two options:
Difference = Weight change with donuts - Weight change with Cheerios
Difference = 8.75 - (-6.25)
Difference = 8.75 + 6.25
Difference = 15 pounds

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, Alex invites 100 people via email. Each of these people will invite 2 friends, so we need to calculate the total number of people invited by these 100 people. This can be calculated as 100 * 2 = 200.

However, this is not the total number of people attending, as Alex also invites 10 friends over the phone. Each of these friends will bring their spouse, so we need to add 10 (friends) + 8 (spouses) = 18 people.

Now, we need to add the people invited via email (200) and the people invited over the phone (18) to get the total number of people attending. However, we also need to account for the fact that the 100 people invited via email will also be attending, so we should not count them again. 

The total number of people attending is 200 (invited by email) + 18 (invited over the phone) + 100 (initially invited) = 318.

However, this counts the 100 people invited via email twice, so we need to subtract 100 from the total to avoid double-counting. 

318 - 100 = 218.

The final answer is: 218"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the weight of each dog in order, starting with the Affenpinscher.

1. The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds.
2. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.
3. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs (1/4) * 20 = 5 pounds.
4. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"To determine the cost difference between buying the boots on Amazon and eBay, we need to calculate the total cost of each option.

On Amazon, the total cost is the sum of the cost of the boots and the shipping cost: $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20.

On eBay, the cost of the boots is $13, but the shipping cost is twice as much as on Amazon, which is 2 * $4 = $8. Therefore, the total cost on eBay is $13 (boots) + $8 (shipping) = $21.

To find the difference in cost, we subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 (eBay) - $20 (Amazon) = $1.

The boots work out to be $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we can use exponential growth principles. The beanstalk starts at 4 feet and doubles in height every day. We need to find the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to be taller than 20 feet.

Let's denote the number of days as 'n'. The height of the beanstalk after 'n' days can be represented as 4 * 2^n, since it doubles every day.

We want to find the smallest 'n' such that 4 * 2^n > 20.

We can start by testing different values of 'n':

- n = 1: 4 * 2^1 = 8 (less than 20)
- n = 2: 4 * 2^2 = 16 (less than 20)
- n = 3: 4 * 2^3 = 32 (greater than 20)

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: 3"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of protein John gets per day and then multiply it by 7 to get the weekly amount.

First, we need to find out how many grams of mushrooms John eats per day. We are given that a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams, but we are also told that John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. This implies that John eats 2 cups of mushrooms per day (since 200 grams is twice the weight of 1 cup).

Now, we know that 1 cup of mushrooms has 3 grams of protein. Since John eats 2 cups of mushrooms per day, he gets 2 x 3 = 6 grams of protein per day.

To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we multiply the daily amount by 7: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams/week.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's break down the information given. If Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can represent his current age as 'x'. Five years ago, his age would be 'x - 5'. According to the problem, his current age is twice his age 5 years ago, so we can write the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting '2x' from both sides gives us:

-x = -10

Multiplying both sides by -1, we get:

x = 10

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years. To find out how old he will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

"To determine the total cost of the dental work, we need to calculate the cost of the two implants and the additional cost of the porcelain crown. 

The base price of each implant is $2000. Since George needs two implants, the total cost of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000.

The additional cost of the porcelain crown is $500. 

So, the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour at work, we can calculate the number of hours he needs to work to pay for the remaining amount by dividing the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the smallest angle as 'x'. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it can be denoted as 2x. The other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it can be denoted as 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

One angle is twice the smallest angle: 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
The other angle is three times the smallest angle: 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine the total number of gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

First, let's convert the coins into cents:
- 8 quarters = 8 * 25 = 200 cents
- 6 dimes = 6 * 10 = 60 cents
- 14 nickels = 14 * 5 = 70 cents
- 15 pennies = 15 * 1 = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has:
200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs a nickel (5 cents), we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:
345 / 5 = 69

Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

69"
"To determine the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and then sum them up.

Dogs have 4 legs each, and there are 5 dogs. So, the total number of legs from dogs is 5 * 4 = 20.

Cats have 4 legs each, and there are 2 cats. So, the total number of legs from cats is 2 * 4 = 8.

Birds have 2 legs each, and there are 10 birds. So, the total number of legs from birds is 10 * 2 = 20.

Now, we add up the total number of legs from each type of pet: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48.

The total number of legs in the pet store is 48."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the weight that Jamaal increased the 8-pound weight by 50%. 

50% of 8 pounds is 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds. 

So, the new weight is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds. 

However, Jamaal finds this weight too heavy, so he uses a weight two pounds lighter than that. 

Therefore, the weight he now uses is 12 - 2 = 10 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into three parts: the first year, the second year, and the third year.

In the first year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift and 5 games as Christmas gifts, totaling 10 games. He also buys 1 game per month for 12 months, which is 12 games. So, in total, he has 10 + 12 = 22 games at the end of the first year.

In the second year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift and 5 games as Christmas gifts, totaling 10 games. He also buys 2 games per month for 12 months, which is 24 games. So, in total, he has 10 + 24 = 34 games at the end of the second year.

In the third year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift and 5 games as Christmas gifts, totaling 10 games. He also buys 4 games per month for 12 months, which is 48 games. So, in total, he has 10 + 48 = 58 games at the end of the third year.

Now, we need to add up the total number of games Steve has at the end of the third year, which is the sum of the games he had at the end of the first year, the second year, and the third year. 

22 (games at the end of the first year) + 34 (games at the end of the second year) + 58 (games at the end of the third year) = 114

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of speed and time. The plane's speed can be calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Speed = 400 miles per hour

Now, we can use the speed to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it would take the plane an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we can find Marissa's hourly rate by multiplying Ruiz's rate by 3/4.

Ruiz's rate = 120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour
Marissa's rate = 3/4 * 60 pounds per hour = 45 pounds per hour

Now, we need to find the total amount of chocolates they make together in 12 hours. We can do this by adding their individual rates multiplied by the number of hours they worked.

Ruiz's total = 60 pounds per hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds
Marissa's total = 45 pounds per hour * 12 hours = 540 pounds
Total amount = Ruiz's total + Marissa's total = 720 pounds + 540 pounds = 1260 pounds

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount spent by Howard at the arcade and subtract it from the initial amount he had.

On Monday, Howard spent $8.
On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, which is 2 * $8 = $16.
On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, which is 4 * $16 = $64.

The total amount spent is $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

Since Howard originally had $100, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount to find the remaining amount: $100 - $88 = $12.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money earned from the first four hours and the next two hours separately, and then add them together.

For the first four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup. So, the total number of cups sold in four hours is 15 * 4 = 60 cups. The total amount earned in the first four hours is 60 * $0.50 = $30.

For the next two hours, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.60 per cup. So, the total number of cups sold in two hours is 10 * 2 = 20 cups. The total amount earned in the next two hours is 20 * $0.60 = $12.

The total amount earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours is $30 + $12 = $42.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of rotations the tires undergo in a month and then divide that by the total number of rotations a tire can undergo before needing replacement.

First, let's calculate the total number of rotations per mile: 725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile.

Since Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, the total number of rotations per month is: 362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles = 145,000 rotations per month.

Now, let's calculate the total number of months a tire can last: 10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations/month = 72 months.

To find the number of years, we divide the total number of months by 12: 72 months / 12 months/year = 6 years.

"To find the cost per pump, we need to first determine the total number of pumps in the bottle. Since the bottle is supposed to last for 120 washes with 2 pumps per wash, we can calculate the total number of pumps as follows:

Total number of pumps = 120 washes * 2 pumps/wash = 240 pumps

Next, we need to find the cost of the shampoo in cents. Since the cost is given in dollars, we need to convert it to cents by multiplying by 100:

Cost in cents = $24.00 * 100 = 2400 cents

Now, we can find the cost per pump by dividing the total cost by the total number of pumps:

Cost per pump = Total cost / Total number of pumps
= 2400 cents / 240 pumps
= 10 cents per pump

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Joe is purchasing, then subtract that from the initial amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is $25 + $35 = $60.

Since there is a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount. To do this, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage (30% or 0.3). The discount amount is $60 * 0.3 = $18.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost: $60 - $18 = $42.

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to calculate it separately. We can subtract the final cost from the initial amount of money Joe has: $50 - $42 = $8.

Therefore, Joe will have $8 left after the purchase.

The final answer is: $8"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of croissants Juan wants to make and then determine the total amount of butter required.

First, let's calculate the total number of croissants Juan wants to make in a week. Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants per day, and there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the number of dozen croissants per day by the number of days:

4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can convert the total number of dozen croissants to individual croissants:

28 dozen * 12 croissants/dozen = 336 croissants

Now, we know that it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find the total amount of butter required, we need to multiply the number of dozen croissants by the amount of butter per dozen:

28 dozen * (1/4 pound/dozen) = 28 * 0.25 pounds = 7 pounds

Therefore, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants per day for a week.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the cost of repaving Lewis' street, we need to first calculate the cost per meter of repaving Lewis' street. Since the cost per meter is the same for both streets, we can use the given cost per meter for Monica's street.

Cost per meter for Monica's street: $194
Length of Monica's street: 150 meters
Cost of repaving Monica's street: $194 * 150 = $29,100

Now, we can find the cost of repaving Lewis' street by multiplying the cost per meter by the length of Lewis' street.

Length of Lewis' street: 490 meters
Cost per meter: $194
Cost of repaving Lewis' street: $194 * 490 = $95,060

To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street.

Cost of repaving Lewis' street: $95,060
Cost of repaving Monica's street: $29,100
Difference: $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

The final answer is: $65,960"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know that John initially received $100,000 for the first 5 months. 

Since his research took 10 times longer than expected, it lasted for 10 * 5 = 50 months.

The funding for the first 5 months is $100,000. 

For the remaining 45 months (50 - 5 = 45), the funding increased by 50% each month. 

Let's calculate the funding for the remaining months. 

The first month after the initial 5 months would be 1.5 times the initial funding, which is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000.

The second month would be 1.5 times the previous month's funding, which is $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000.

We can see a pattern here, where each month's funding is 1.5 times the previous month's funding. This is a geometric progression.

The sum of a geometric progression can be calculated using the formula: S = a * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = $150,000 (the first month's funding after the initial 5 months), r = 1.5, and n = 45.

Plugging in the values, we get: S = $150,000 * (1.5^45 - 1) / (1.5 - 1).

S = $150,000 * (3.141509... - 1) / 0.5

S = $150,000 * 2.141509...

S ≈ $321,722.65

Now, we add the initial 5 months' funding to the remaining months' funding: $100,000 + $321,722.65 ≈ $421,722.65

The final answer is: $421,723"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of meat consumed by the first three players. 

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak. 
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so the total amount of meat consumed by the second player is 8 ounces. 
The third player ate a one-pound steak, which is equivalent to 16 ounces (1 pound = 16 ounces).

Now, let's add up the total amount of meat consumed by the first three players: 6 + 8 + 16 = 30 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat. Therefore, the total amount of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Scarlett purchased. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the rocks: 2 bags of rocks at $2.50 each is 2 x $2.50 = $5.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the coral: 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 each is 3 x $2.00 = $6.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the fish: 20 fish at $0.50 each is 20 x $0.50 = $10.00.

The cost of the fish food is $2.00.

The total cost of the items is the sum of the costs of the rocks, coral, fish, and fish food: $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00 = $23.00.

However, we also need to add the cost of the aquarium, which was $10.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find the total number of seats in the auditorium. Since there are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, the total number of seats is:

Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

Next, we need to find the number of seats occupied by the administrators. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, so:

Administrators = (1/4) * 72 seats = 18 seats

Now, we need to find the number of remaining seats after the administrators have occupied their seats. Remaining seats = Total seats - Administrators = 72 seats - 18 seats = 54 seats

Next, we need to find the number of seats occupied by the parents. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents, so:

Parents = (1/3) * 54 seats = 18 seats

Now, we need to find the number of seats occupied by the students. The rest of the seats were occupied by the students, so:

Students = Remaining seats - Parents = 54 seats - 18 seats = 36 seats

DVD 2 has been played 135 times and can be played 1000 times before breaking, so it can be played 1000 - 135 = 865 more times.

The total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is 644 + 865 = 1509.

The final answer is: 1509"

6 weeks * 2 sessions per week * 2 hours per session = 24 hours

The cost per hour is $125. Therefore, the total cost of the physical therapy is:

24 hours * $125 per hour = $3000

The final answer is: $3000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he spends 8 hours at school. Therefore, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

2. He chews 1 piece of gum on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner. So, in total, he chews 4 (at school) + 1 (on the way home) + 1 (after dinner) = 6 pieces of gum.

3. He starts with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

4. He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 14 / 2 = 7. So, he gives 7 pieces to his sister.

5. After giving 7 pieces to his sister, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine Charmaine's current age and then calculate her age 4 years from now.

Since Charmaine will be 16 years old in 12 years, we can subtract 12 from 16 to find her current age. 

16 (future age) - 12 (years until then) = 4 (current age)

Now, we need to find Charmaine's age 4 years from now. We add 4 to her current age.

4 (current age) + 4 (years from now) = 8

Therefore, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now.

"To find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we need to calculate the total amount spent by each coach and then find the difference.

The baseball coach bought 9 new baseballs for $3 each, so the total amount spent by the baseball coach is 9 x $3 = $27.

The basketball coach bought 8 new basketballs for $14 each, so the total amount spent by the basketball coach is 8 x $14 = $112.

Now, let's find the difference between the amounts spent by the two coaches: $112 - $27 = $85.

The final answer is: $85"
"To find the total number of flowers that have bloomed, we first need to determine the total number of flowers in the garden. Since there are 10 rows with 20 flowers in each row, the total number of flowers is 10 * 20 = 200.

Next, we are told that only 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed. To find the number of bloomed flowers, we multiply the total number of flowers by 4/5.

Number of bloomed flowers = (4/5) * 200
= 4 * 200 / 5
= 800 / 5
= 160

Therefore, 160 flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb/s to Mb/s and then multiply it by the number of seconds in an hour.

1 Mb = 1000 kb
Ashley's speed in kb/s = 20 kb/s

To convert kb/s to Mb/s, we divide by 1000:
20 kb/s / 1000 = 0.02 Mb/s

There are 3600 seconds in an hour. To find Ashley's speed in Mb/h, we multiply her speed in Mb/s by the number of seconds in an hour:
0.02 Mb/s * 3600 s/h = 72 Mb/h

The final answer is: 72"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts. The tow truck pulled 10 cars for each of the first three days, so the total number of cars pulled in those three days is 10 * 3 = 30.

For the remaining days of the week, there are 7 - 3 = 4 days. On each of these days, the tow truck pulled 10 - 4 = 6 cars. So, the total number of cars pulled on these days is 6 * 4 = 24.

To find the total number of cars pulled that week, we add the number of cars pulled in the first three days to the number of cars pulled in the remaining days: 30 + 24 = 54.

"To determine the number of years until Adam is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to calculate the difference between the required height (4 feet) and Adam's current height (40 inches), and then divide that by his annual growth rate (2 inches).

First, let's convert the required height from feet to inches: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.

Now, let's calculate the difference between the required height and Adam's current height: 48 inches - 40 inches = 8 inches.

Next, we'll divide the difference by Adam's annual growth rate: 8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years.

Therefore, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years.

"To determine James' earnings, we need to calculate the profit from selling the cars, then apply his commission to that profit.

First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the cars:

10 cars * $25,000 per car = $250,000

Next, we need to calculate the cost of acquiring the cars. The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars, so the cost is:

$25,000 * 0.3 = $7,500 per car
10 cars * $7,500 per car = $75,000

Now, we can calculate the profit from selling the cars:

Profit = Total Revenue - Cost
Profit = $250,000 - $75,000
Profit = $175,000

James gets a 10% commission on the profit, so his earnings are:

Earnings = Profit * 0.1
Earnings = $175,000 * 0.1
Earnings = $17,500

The final answer is: $17,500"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright on the wave. This means 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders can stay upright.

Next, we are told that 60% of these 25 riders are women. To find the number of women, we multiply 25 by 0.6, which gives us 15 women.

Since there are 25 riders in total who can stay upright, and 15 of them are women, the remaining riders who can stay upright are men. Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is 25 - 15 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the price of the gold and silver jewels. 

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, and the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

Next, we are given that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold. So, we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we have the prices of all three jewels: diamond ($2000), gold ($1600), and silver ($1200). To find the total price for all three jewels, we simply add their prices together:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. 

Next, we know he bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. So, the number of truck stamps is 16 + 3 = 19.

Then, we know he bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. So, the number of rose stamps is 19 - 9 = 10.

Now, we need to find the total number of stamps Max bought. To do this, we add the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps together: 16 + 19 + 10 = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of relative speed. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom, we need to find the time it takes for Tom to cover this distance. 

First, we need to find the relative speed between Bob and Tom. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed to get the relative speed. 

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph
Relative speed = -15 mph

However, since speed cannot be negative, we need to take the absolute value of the relative speed.

Relative speed = | -15 mph | = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, we know that Naomi caught 17 fish. 

Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, we can calculate Darren's catch by subtracting 6 from Naomi's catch: 17 - 6 = 11.

Now, we know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. To find Tommy's catch, we add 3 to Darren's catch: 11 + 3 = 14.

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish.

The final answer is: 14"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of classes Manny can miss while still keeping the average cost per class below $10.

Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as 'x'. Since there are 10 total classes, the number of classes he will attend is 10 - x.

The total cost of the classes is $60, which is the same regardless of how many classes Manny attends. We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

(10 - x) * 10 = 60

This equation represents the total cost of the classes, where the number of classes attended is 10 - x, and the cost per class is $10.

Simplifying the equation:

10 * 10 - 10x = 60
100 - 10x = 60

Subtracting 100 from both sides:

-10x = -40

Dividing both sides by -10:

x = 4

Therefore, Manny can miss 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of customers each person processes per day and then multiply that by 7 to find the weekly production.

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, she processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day.

The total number of customers processed by Jewel in a week is 50 * 7 = 350.

The total number of customers processed by Julie in a week is 100 * 7 = 700.

The total weekly production for the two is 350 + 700 = 1050.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Let's denote the distance Lynn ran as 'x'.
2. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, which is 5 * 4 = 20 miles.
3. Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so we can write an equation: 20 = x + 3.
4. To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate it. Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: 20 - 3 = x + 3 - 3.
5. Simplifying the equation, we get: 17 = x.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of one apple and one orange. 

Let's start with the cost of one apple. If four apples cost $5.20, then the cost of one apple is $5.20 divided by 4, which is $1.30.

Now, let's find the cost of one orange. If three oranges cost $3.30, then the cost of one orange is $3.30 divided by 3, which is $1.10.

Now that we know the cost of one apple and one orange, we can find the total cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges. The cost of 5 apples is 5 times the cost of one apple, which is 5 x $1.30 = $6.50. The cost of 5 oranges is 5 times the cost of one orange, which is 5 x $1.10 = $5.50.

The total cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges is the sum of the cost of 5 apples and the cost of 5 oranges, which is $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

"To determine the time it will take Bob to dig the hole, we need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the hole) is given by the formula V = lwh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.

Given the dimensions of the hole, we can calculate the volume as follows:

V = lwh
= 6 feet * 4 feet * 3 feet
= 72 cubic feet

Since it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we can multiply the volume of the hole by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot to find the total time it will take to dig the hole:

Time = Volume * Time per cubic foot
= 72 cubic feet * 3 seconds/cubic foot
= 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

"To determine the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the features and the base price:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

"To calculate Tim's new monthly salary, we need to find 5% of his current salary and add it to his current salary. 

5% of $20,000 is 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000. 

So, his new monthly salary is $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000.

The bonus is half a month's salary, which is $21,000 / 2 = $10,500.

His total monthly income is $21,000 (salary) + $10,500 (bonus) = $31,500.

To find his yearly income, we multiply his monthly income by 12: $31,500 * 12 = $378,000.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay separately, and then add those times together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil. Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil, and he needs to dig 24 feet of soil. 

Time to dig through soil = Total soil depth / Rate of digging through soil
Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour
Time to dig through soil = 6 hours

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay. Bill can dig half as fast through clay as he can through soil, so his rate of digging through clay is 4 / 2 = 2 feet/hour. He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

Time to dig through clay = Total clay depth / Rate of digging through clay
Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour
Time to dig through clay = 4 hours

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay to get the total time.

Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours
Total time = 10 hours

"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on each day and then subtract the two amounts.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got a $2 discount. So, the total cost is:

20 pomegranates * $20 = $400
Discount: $2
Total cost = $400 - $2 = $398

On the second day, the price shot to $30 per fruit, and a 10% discount was offered on the total cost. Sheila bought 20 pomegranates. 

First, let's calculate the total cost without the discount:
20 pomegranates * $30 = $600

Now, let's calculate the 10% discount:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the total sales from green hats in the first month. Since the sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, let's denote the total sales from green hats as G. Then, the sales from red hats, which is half of G, is G/2. We are given that G/2 = $400. 

To find G, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2, which gives us G = 2 * 400 = $800.

Now, we know that the total sales in the first month is the sum of the sales from red and green hats, which is G + G/2. Substituting the value of G, we get 800 + 400 = $1200.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month are (3/4) * 1200 = $900.

The total amount she made in two months is the sum of the sales in the first and second months, which is 1200 + 900 = $2100.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the difference between Sally's expected wage and the actual amount she received. 

First, let's calculate the expected total amount in Sally's bank account if she received her full wage. Since her weekly wage is $300, and her bank account initially held $200, the expected total amount would be $200 (initial amount) + $300 (weekly wage) = $500.

However, the actual amount in her bank account is $420. To find the difference, we subtract the actual amount from the expected amount: $500 (expected amount) - $420 (actual amount) = $80.

This means that Sally was short $80 from her expected wage.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of deviled egg halves Lori needs to serve her guests. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and she is inviting 16 guests, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is 16 * 3 = 48.

Since Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many whole eggs are needed to make 48 deviled egg halves. To do this, we divide 48 by 2, which equals 24. This means Lori needs 24 whole eggs.

To find out how many dozens of eggs Lori needs, we divide 24 by 12 (since there are 12 eggs in a dozen). 24 / 12 = 2.

Therefore, Lori needs 2 dozen eggs for her party.

"To determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we need to calculate how many days it will take him to read the entire book at his planned rate.

Mike plans to read 10 pages a day. The total number of pages in the book is 200. 

To find out how many days it will take Mike to read the book, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day: 

200 pages / 10 pages per day = 20 days

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we subtract the number of days it will take him to read the book from the total number of days:

30 days - 20 days = 10 days

Therefore, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the plane and the total cost of maintenance for the first year.

The cost of the plane is $150,000.

The monthly cost of renting a hanger is $5000. 

The monthly cost of fuel is twice the cost of renting a hanger, which is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The total monthly cost of maintenance is $5000 (hanger) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total cost of maintenance for the first year is $15,000 * 12 = $180,000.

The total cost of getting and maintaining the plane for the first year is the cost of the plane plus the cost of maintenance, which is $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000.

For the first mixture, we have 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. The cost of almonds is $10 per pound, and the cost of walnuts is $15 per pound. 

The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is (1/2) * $10 = $5. 
The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is (1/3) * $15 = $5.

The total cost of the first mixture is $5 + $5 = $10.

For the second mixture, we have 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. 

The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is (1/5) * $10 = $2.
The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is (1/3) * $15 = $5.

The total cost of the second mixture is $2 + $5 = $7.

Now, we need to find the difference between the costs of the two mixtures. The difference is $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G.

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of legs can be represented as 4S + 2G = 70.

We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, which means the sum of the number of sheep and geese is 20. This can be represented as S + G = 20.

We can solve the second equation for G: G = 20 - S.

Now, substitute G = 20 - S into the first equation: 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70.

Simplify the equation: 4S + 40 - 2S = 70.

Combine like terms: 2S + 40 = 70.

Subtract 40 from both sides: 2S = 30.

Divide both sides by 2: S = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's determine the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. Since it costs 20% more than the normal brand, we need to calculate 20% of $5 and add it to $5.

20% of $5 = 0.20 * $5 = $1
Cost of the more expensive brand = $5 + $1 = $6 per pound

Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee and uses 1 pound per day, he needs 7 pounds of coffee.

Cost of the more expensive coffee for a week = 7 * $6 = $42

He also buys a donut for $2.

Total cost = Cost of the more expensive coffee for a week + Cost of the donut
Total cost = $42 + $2 = $44

The final answer is: $44"
"This question appears to be a request for a numerical answer, but it does not align with the constraints of the philosophy domain. However, I can provide a response that acknowledges the request while also addressing the philosophical aspect of the question.

From a philosophical perspective, the question seems to be an example of a classic problem in epistemology, specifically in the realm of inductive reasoning. The question presents a scenario where we are given a set of premises (Gus's purchases) and are asked to infer the cost of an item that is not explicitly mentioned (the apple pie).

To solve this problem, we can use a deductive approach, which involves using the given information to deduce the unknown quantity. Let's break down the information provided:

1. Gus spent $20.00 in total.
2. He bought 2 bags of chips for $2.00 each, which totals $4.00.
3. He bought a bucket of fried chicken for $8.00.
4. He bought a bottle of soda for $1.00.

We can calculate the total cost of the items mentioned as follows:

$4.00 (chips) + $8.00 (fried chicken) + $1.00 (soda) = $13.00

Since Gus spent $20.00 in total, we can subtract the cost of the mentioned items from the total to find the cost of the apple pie:

$20.00 (total) - $13.00 (mentioned items) = $7.00

Therefore, the apple pie cost $7.00.

The final answer is: $7.00"
"To find the number of newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered.

Let's denote the number of newspapers delivered to District B as x.

We know that:
- Total newspapers delivered = 600
- Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
- Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

We can set up the equation:
x + 198 + 209 = 600

Combine the constants:
x + 407 = 600

Subtract 407 from both sides:
x = 600 - 407
x = 193

Therefore, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B.

The final answer is: 193"
"To determine the total number of recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total class time and then divide it by the time it takes to learn a new recipe.

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so the total class time per week is 4 * 2 = 8 hours. Since the class lasts for 6 weeks, the total class time is 8 * 6 = 48 hours.

John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. To find out how many recipes he learns, we divide the total class time by the time it takes to learn a new recipe: 48 / 1.5 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find the number of math teachers on the court. Since 60% of the teachers are history teachers, the remaining 40% must be math teachers. 

40% of 150 is calculated as 0.4 * 150 = 60. 

So, there are 60 math teachers on the court. 

Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours they sleep per day: 60 * 6 = 360.

The final answer is: 360"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the amount of money Kassidy and Rayna have. 

Since Aurelia has $120, and Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can calculate Kassidy's amount as follows:

Kassidy's money = 3/4 * Aurelia's money
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * 120
Kassidy's money = 90

Now, we know that Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's amount as follows:

Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + 60
Rayna's money = 90 + 60
Rayna's money = 150

Now that we have the amounts for Aurelia, Kassidy, and Rayna, we can calculate the total amount of money they have together:

Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
Total money = 120 + 90 + 150
Total money = 360

If they decide to add their money together and share it equally among them, we need to divide the total money by 3 (the number of people):

Shared amount per person = Total money / 3
Shared amount per person = 360 / 3
Shared amount per person = 120

"To determine the total length of the game, we need to calculate the length of the regular game and then add the additional time played in the extended quarter.

The regular game consists of 4 quarters, each 12 minutes long. So, the total length of the regular game is 4 * 12 = 48 minutes.

However, the game was extended for 5 minutes due to a tie in the last quarter. To find the total length of the game, we need to add the extended time to the regular game time.

Total game length = Regular game time + Extended time
Total game length = 48 minutes + 5 minutes
Total game length = 53 minutes

"To find the number of employees who oversee the company, we need to first find the number of management employees and then find 30% of that number.

First, let's find the number of management employees. 20% of 50 employees are management, so we multiply 50 by 0.2:

50 * 0.2 = 10

Now, we need to find 30% of the management employees. 30% of 10 is:

10 * 0.3 = 3

Therefore, 3 employees oversee the company.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of dry ingredients required for 16 muffins. 

First, let's calculate the amount of flour needed for 16 muffins: 
5 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 80 tablespoons of flour.

Next, let's calculate the amount of sugar needed for 16 muffins: 
3 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 48 tablespoons of sugar.

Now, let's calculate the amount of salt needed for 16 muffins: 
0.25 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 4 tablespoons of salt.

Finally, we add up the amounts of flour, sugar, and salt to find the total amount of dry ingredients needed: 
80 tablespoons (flour) + 48 tablespoons (sugar) + 4 tablespoons (salt) = 132 tablespoons.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Christina had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral. Since there are 30 days in total, the number of neutral days can be calculated as follows:

Total days = 30
Good days = 12
Bad days = 8
Neutral days = Total days - (Good days + Bad days)
Neutral days = 30 - (12 + 8)
Neutral days = 30 - 20
Neutral days = 10

However, we are given that the first 8 days were good, the next 8 days were bad, and the next 8 days were neutral. This means that the first 24 days are already accounted for. 

The next three days were good, neutral, and good. So, we need to add these three days to the initial good days.

Initial good days = 12
Additional good days = 3
Total good days = Initial good days + Additional good days
Total good days = 12 + 3
Total good days = 15

However, we need to consider that the question asks for the number of good days left in the month. Since the first 24 days are already accounted for, we need to subtract the good days that have already occurred from the total good days.

Good days already occurred = 8 (first 8 days)
Good days left = Total good days - Good days already occurred
Good days left = 15 - 8
Good days left = 7

"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic reasoning. Let's denote the number of books Sally has as 'x'. According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as 2x + 3. We are also given that Janey has 21 books. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

2x + 3 = 21

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for 'x':

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the initial height of the bamboo from feet to inches, as the growth rate is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the initial height of 20 feet is equivalent to 20 * 12 = 240 inches.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches. The growth rate is 30 inches per day. To find the number of days, we can use the formula:

Number of days = (Final height - Initial height) / Growth rate
= (600 - 240) / 30
= 360 / 30
= 12

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. This means each dog has 1 toy. When 8 more dogs arrive, James needs 8 more toys to bring the total to 12 dogs with 1 toy each. So, he buys 8 more toys.

Now, there are 12 dogs, and James goes back to find that there are twice as many more dogs, which means there are 24 dogs in total (12 + 12). Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 24 toys. However, he already has 12 toys, so he needs 24 - 12 = 12 more toys.

When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs those toys. This means he needs 24 - 3 = 21 toys.

However, we need to consider the initial 12 toys James already had. So, the total number of toys James needs is 21 (for the 21 dogs) + 12 (initial toys) = 33 toys.

Dylan's investment is 2/5 of the total amount, which is (2/5) * 1200 = $480.

The remaining amount after Dylan's investment is 1200 - 480 = $720.

Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, which is (2/3) * 720 = $480.

The amount remaining after Frances' investment is 720 - 480 = $240.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of signatures the sisters currently have, and then calculate how many more they need to reach their goal.

The total number of signatures the sisters currently have is the sum of Carol's and Jennifer's signatures: 20 + 44 = 64.

Since they want to reach 100 signatures by the end of the summer, we need to subtract the number of signatures they already have from their goal: 100 - 64 = 36.

However, they have three more weeks of summer vacation, and they have already spent five weeks collecting signatures. Since they want to reach their goal by the end of the summer, we need to consider the remaining time they have to collect signatures. 

Since they have three more weeks, and they want to reach their goal, we can assume they will collect the same number of signatures per week as they did in the previous five weeks. 

However, we don't know the exact number of signatures they collect per week. To find out how many signatures they need to collect per week, we can divide the number of signatures they need to collect by the number of weeks they have left: 36 / 3 = 12.

Now, we know they need to collect 12 signatures per week for the remaining three weeks.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine Karen's hourly wage and then calculate her total earnings for two days.

Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen's hourly wage is 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.

Now, we need to calculate Karen's total earnings for two days. She works 3 hours per day, so in two days, she works 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

To find her total earnings, we multiply her hourly wage by the number of hours she works: $20 * 6 = $120.

Therefore, Karen earns $120 in two days.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. We know that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns. 

First, let's find the ratio of potatoes to hash browns: 6 potatoes / 36 hash browns. 

To simplify this ratio, we can divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 6. 

6 / 6 = 1
36 / 6 = 6

So, the simplified ratio is 1 potato to 6 hash browns.

Now, we can use this ratio to find out how many hash browns we can make from 96 potatoes. 

We multiply the number of potatoes by the ratio of hash browns per potato: 96 potatoes * 6 hash browns/potato.

96 * 6 = 576

Therefore, we can make 576 hash browns from 96 potatoes.

"To find the total weight of the 9 adults, we need to multiply the average weight of an adult by the number of adults. 

Total weight = average weight of an adult * number of adults
Total weight = 80 kg * 9
Total weight = 720 kg

Since the elevator supports a maximum load of 700 kg, we need to find the excess weight.

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cookies each person has and then add them up.

We know that Katarina has 68 cookies. 

Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, Max must have 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

To find the total number of cookies, we add the number of cookies each person has: 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final length of the dress. Let's denote the original length of the dress as 'x'. 

Since Shania extended the dress by 50% of its original length, the new length after extension is x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

Then, she added 20cm to the bottom of the dress. So, the final length of the dress is 1.5x + 20 = 140cm.

Now, we can solve for 'x' by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation: 1.5x = 140 - 20, which simplifies to 1.5x = 120.

To isolate 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 1.5: x = 120 / 1.5.

x = 80.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode and then add those times together.

First, let's find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in turtle mode. Since it takes 1 hour to mow the entire lawn in turtle mode, it will take 0.5 hours to mow half the lawn. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 0.5 * 60 = 30 minutes.

Next, let's find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode. Since it takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn in rabbit mode, it will take 20 minutes to mow half the lawn (half of 40 minutes).

Now, we add the times together: 30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as T+7 as well, since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet. 

We have three equations based on the given information: 
1. The sum of the ages of the twins is T + (T+7) = 2T + 7.
2. The sum of the ages of the triplet and the twins is (T+7) + T + (T+7) = 3T + 14.
3. The sum of the ages of the twins and the triplet is 44.

We can equate the second equation to the third equation to find the value of T: 
3T + 14 = 44

Now, we can solve for T:
3T = 44 - 14
3T = 30
T = 10

Since T is the age of the younger twin, the age of the older twin is T+7 = 10+7 = 17.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of the candies. Since Manolo bought 4 candies for $3.20, we can find the cost of one candy by dividing the total cost by the number of candies.

Cost of one candy = Total cost of candies / Number of candies
= $3.20 / 4
= $0.80

Now, we know the cost of one candy and one lollipop. We can find the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies by multiplying the cost of one lollipop by 10 and the cost of one candy by 10, and then adding the two amounts.

Cost of 10 lollipops = 10 x $0.40

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of coins Rong and Neil save per month. Rong saves 20 coins per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, which is 2/5 * 20 = 8 coins more than Rong. So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Since they both save coins every month, we can calculate the total number of coins they save in a year. Rong saves 20 * 12 = 240 coins per year. Neil saves 28 * 12 = 336 coins per year.

To find the total number of coins they save in 10 years, we multiply the number of coins they save per year by 10. Rong saves 240 * 10 = 2400 coins in 10 years. Neil saves 336 * 10 = 3360 coins in 10 years.

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is the sum of the coins Rong and Neil have saved. So, the total number of coins is 2400 + 3360 = 5760.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. 

The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, which is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. Let's denote the total bill as 'x'. Then, 60% of x is 0.6x. The cost of the vaccines is $40, so we can set up the equation: 0.6x = $40 + x. 

However, this equation is incorrect because the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, not the sum of the vaccines and the heartworm check. The correct equation is: 0.6x = (2 * $20) + x. 

Simplifying the equation, we get: 0.6x = $40 + x. Subtracting x from both sides, we get: 0.4x = $40. Dividing both sides by 0.4, we get: x = $100. 

Now that we know the total bill is $100, we can calculate the cost of the heartworm check. The cost of the heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60. 

The total cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check is $40 + $60 = $100.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each type of fruit in one crate:

- Bananas: 5 bananas * $1 = $5
- Apples: 12 apples * $0.5 = $6
- Oranges: 7 oranges * $3 = $21

- Green squares: 18 + 6 = 24
- White squares: 24 - 12 = 12

Now, let's find the total number of squares:
Total squares = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the area of each square is 1 square foot. Therefore, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares:
Total area = Total squares = 68 square feet

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total points collected by the students and then subtract that from the minimum threshold of 400 points.

First, let's find out how many points Betty collected. Since Betty collected 30% more points than Adam, we can calculate this as follows:

Let x be the number of points Adam collected. Then, Betty collected 1.3x points.

We know Adam collected 50 points, so x = 50. Therefore, Betty collected 1.3 * 50 = 65 points.

Now, let's find out how many points Tom collected. We know Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom collected 65 - 30 = 35 points.

We also know that Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom, so Marta collected 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by all the students:

Adam: 50 points
Betty: 65 points
Tom: 35 points
Marta: 105 points

Total points collected = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points

To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the minimum threshold of 400 points:

Points missing = 400 - 255 = 145 points

The final answer is: 145"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the family structure and apply basic arithmetic. 

Great Grandma Jones has 3 children. Each of her children has 3 children of their own, making a total of 3 * 3 = 9 grandchildren. 

Each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 babies of their own, making a total of 9 * 3 = 27 great-grandchildren.

Therefore, the total number of great-grandbabies at the family reunion will be 27.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount Greta puts into her retirement account and her car payment, then subtract those amounts from her total paycheck.

First, let's calculate the amount Greta puts into her retirement account: 50% of $2400.00 is 0.5 * $2400.00 = $1200.00.

Next, let's calculate the amount Greta uses for her car payment: 20% of $2400.00 is 0.2 * $2400.00 = $480.00.

Now, let's subtract these amounts from her total paycheck: $2400.00 - $1200.00 - $480.00 = $720.00.

Therefore, Greta has $720.00 left to spend.

The final answer is: $720.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of pencils in the box. Since there are 4 pencils missing, we subtract 4 from the total capacity of the box, which is 20.

20 (total capacity) - 4 (missing pencils) = 16 pencils

Now, we need to find the number of pairs of pencils. A pair consists of 2 pencils. To find the number of pairs, we divide the total number of pencils by 2.

16 pencils / 2 = 8 pairs

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we first need to calculate the number of fireworks set off in the city and then determine what percentage of those she can see from her house.

The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks set off in the city is 15 * 20 = 300.

Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, which is 0.4 * 300 = 120 fireworks.

In addition to the city's fireworks, Hannah will set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard, which is 3 * 5 = 15 fireworks.

The total number of fireworks Hannah will see is the sum of the city's fireworks she can see and the fireworks in her backyard, which is 120 + 15 = 135.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of people, drinks, and snacks. 

First, we know that Aiden and 12 of his friends are going to the cinema, and then they meet up with 7 more friends. So, the total number of people is 1 (Aiden) + 12 (his friends) + 7 (additional friends) = 20.

Since each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks, we can assume that there are 20 seats. Therefore, the total number of drinks is 20 * 2 = 40, and the total number of snacks is 20 * 3 = 60.

The cost of drinks is 40 * $2 = $80, and the cost of snacks is 60 * $2 = $120.

The total cost of snacks and drinks is $80 + $120 = $200.

The final numerical answer is: $200"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

Now, let's denote the capacity of Gary's truck as x. We know that the combined capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds. So, we can write the equation: 4,000 + 4,800 + x = 11,600.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 8,800 + x = 11,600.

Subtracting 8,800 from both sides, we get: x = 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800.

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

The final answer is: 2800"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of dumplings each male ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

There are 6 females, and each female ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

The total number of dumplings eaten is 32 (by males) + 18 (by females) = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the total number of dumplings eaten, which is 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the amount of money Gerald and Julia received based on the given ratio. 

The total parts in the ratio are 3 + 2 = 5. 

Gerald's share is 3 out of 5 parts, so he received 3/5 of the total amount. 

The total amount is $100, so Gerald's share is (3/5) * 100 = $60.

Gerald spent $10 on a book, so to find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount spent from his initial share: $60 - $10 = $50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the speed of the turtle. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, and the cat's speed is 15 feet/second, we can calculate the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

Turtle's speed = Cat's speed / 5
Turtle's speed = 15 feet/second / 5
Turtle's speed = 3 feet/second

Now that we know the turtle's speed, we can calculate the distance it can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

The final answer is: 120"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which the firefighters are raising money and then calculate how many hours it will take to reach their goal.

Let's start by finding the rate at which they are raising money per hour. They raised $2100 in 3 hours, so we can divide the amount raised by the number of hours to find the rate:

$2100 / 3 hours = $700 per hour

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take to raise the remaining amount. The total goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100, so the remaining amount is:

$6300 - $2100 = $4200

Since they are raising $700 per hour, we can divide the remaining amount by the rate to find the number of hours needed to reach the goal:

$4200 / $700 per hour = 6 hours

However, this is the number of hours needed to raise the remaining amount, but we also need to include the 3 hours they have already worked. Therefore, the total number of hours they need to fundraise is:

6 hours + 3 hours = 9 hours

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we first need to find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city, and then subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes.

The city uses 40% of the river's water. 

80% of the water used by the city is used for industrial purposes, so the percentage used for non-industrial purposes is 100% - 80% = 20% of the water used by the city.

To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we multiply the percentage of the river's water used by the city (40%) by the percentage used for non-industrial purposes (20%):

40% * 20% = 0.4 * 0.2 = 0.08

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.08 * 100 = 8%

Therefore, the city uses 8% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to first calculate the total number of days in 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks would have 7 * 2 = 14 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the rate at which the factory produces chocolate and vanilla ice cream per hour. 

Let's start with the chocolate ice cream production. The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours, so the rate of production is 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour.

Now, let's look at the vanilla ice cream production. The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, so the rate of production is 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now that we have the rates of production for both flavors, we can calculate the total production per hour. The factory produces 50 quarts of chocolate ice cream per hour and 12.5 quarts of vanilla ice cream per hour, so the total production per hour is 50 + 12.5 = 62.5 quarts per hour.

To find the total production in 48 hours, we multiply the total production per hour by the number of hours: 62.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 3000 quarts.

The final answer is: 3000"
"To calculate Marcus' total bill, we need to first find the total cost of each item and then apply the discount.

The total cost of the croissants is 5 * $3.00 = $15.00.
The total cost of the cinnamon rolls is 4 * $2.50 = $10.00.
The total cost of the mini quiches is 3 * $4.00 = $12.00.
The total cost of the blueberry muffins is 13 * $1.00 = $13.00.

The total cost of all items is $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

Since Marcus has a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $50.00, which is 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00.

The total bill after the discount is $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00.

"This problem can be approached through a simple mathematical analysis. 

First, let's consider the cost of the ice cream. Each scoop costs $1.50. Since Erin is buying 2 scoops and getting 1 free, she is essentially paying for 2 scoops. 

The cost of 2 scoops is 2 * $1.50 = $3.00. 

Since Erin has $6.00, she can afford to buy 2 scoops of ice cream and still have $3.00 left over. However, the question asks how many scoops she should buy, not how many she can afford. 

In this case, the deal is to buy 2 scoops and get 1 free, so Erin should buy 2 scoops to get the free scoop.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of candies each person eats in two weeks and then subtract the difference from the initial amount of candies Amy has.

First, let's calculate the number of days in two weeks: 2 weeks * 7 days/week = 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, Ginger will have 100 - 56 = 44 pieces, and Amy will have 100 - 42 = 58 pieces.

To find out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger, we subtract the number of candies Ginger has from the number of candies Amy has: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total number of tiles needed, we first need to calculate the area of two-thirds of the bathroom. 

The area of the entire bathroom is 36 sq ft. To find two-thirds of this area, we multiply 36 by 2/3.

36 * (2/3) = 36 * 2 / 3 = 72 / 3 = 24

So, two-thirds of the bathroom's area is 24 sq ft. 

Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 tiles per square foot, we multiply the area by the number of tiles per square foot.

24 sq ft * 24 tiles/sq ft = 24 * 24 = 576

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.

576"
"To determine how much James saved, we need to calculate the cost of buying the blueberries at the store and compare it to the cost of picking them.

The cost of picking blueberries is $20 (initial cost) + $1.5 per pound * 30 pounds (amount picked) = $20 + $45 = $65.

The cost of buying the blueberries at the store is $2.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $75.

The difference in cost is $75 (store price) - $65 (picking price) = $10.

James saved $10 by picking the blueberries himself.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the original planned cost per computer, which is $700. However, the price of each computer is 10% higher than planned. 

To find the new price, we need to calculate 10% of the original price and add it to the original price. 

10% of $700 is 0.1 * 700 = $70. 

The new price per computer is $700 + $70 = $770.

Now, we need to find the total amount of money they paid to buy 500 computers at the new price. 

Total amount = new price per computer * number of computers
Total amount = $770 * 500
Total amount = $385,000

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of chairs the restaurant initially had. This is the sum of the normal chairs and the baby chairs.

Total initial chairs = Normal chairs + Baby chairs
Total initial chairs = 170 + 23
Total initial chairs = 193

Next, we need to calculate the total number of chairs that were sent to the carpenter for repair. This is the sum of the normal chairs and the baby chairs that were sent.

Chairs sent for repair = Normal chairs sent + Baby chairs sent
Chairs sent for repair = 20 + 13
Chairs sent for repair = 33

Now, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total initial number of chairs to find the number of chairs left.

Chairs left = Total initial chairs - Chairs sent for repair
Chairs left = 193 - 33

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of slices eaten and subtract it from the total number of slices available.

First, let's find out how many slices Bryce and two friends ate. Since there are 5 people in total, and 3 of them ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we can calculate the total number of slices they ate as follows:

3 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 8 slices/person * 3 people = 24 slices

However, this is not the total number of slices eaten, as the two remaining friends also ate some. We need to calculate the number of slices they ate as well.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas, which is equivalent to 3/4. Since there are 2 friends, we can calculate the total number of slices they ate as follows:

2 friends * 3/4 * 12 slices/friend = 9 slices/friend * 2 friends = 18 slices

Now, we can add the slices eaten by both groups to get the total number of slices eaten:

24 slices + 18 slices = 42 slices

Since there are 5 friends in total, and each ordered 1 pizza, the total number of slices available is:

5 friends * 12 slices/friend = 60 slices

Now, we can subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices available to get the number of slices left:

60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices

The final answer is: 18"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. Since the dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 the time it takes the cat, and the cat takes 30 minutes, the dog takes 2/3 * 30 = 20 minutes to eat the sausages.

Now, we need to find the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. To do this, we add the time it takes for the cat and the dog to eat the sausages and divide by 2.

Average time = (30 + 20) / 2
Average time = 50 / 2

"To solve this problem, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 8 feet to inches by multiplying 8 by 12, which equals 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, we get a total of 100 inches for the length of one of Topher's shoes.

Now, we are given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. We can write the equation as:

100 = 9x + 10

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

90 = 9x

Now, we divide both sides by 9 to find the value of 'x':

x = 90 / 9
x = 10

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of windows smashed for both students' and teachers' cars separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the total number of windows smashed for the students' cars. Since Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, we need to find a quarter of 64 cars. A quarter of 64 is 64 / 4 = 16 cars. Since each car has 4 windows, the total number of windows smashed for the students' cars is 16 * 4 = 64.

Next, let's find the total number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars. Since Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, we need to find 3/4ths of 32 cars. 3/4ths of 32 is (3/4) * 32 = 24 cars. Since each car has 2 windows, the total number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars is 24 * 2 = 48.

Now, we add the total number of windows smashed for both students' and teachers' cars to find the overall total. 64 (students' cars) + 48 (teachers' cars) = 112.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, 5000 people were in line at 8:00. By midday, 2/5 of them had voted. 

2/5 of 5000 is (2/5) * 5000 = 2000 people who voted by midday.

So, the number of people remaining by midday is 5000 - 2000 = 3000.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 

2/3 of 3000 is (2/3) * 3000 = 2000 people who voted by 16:00.

So, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 3000 - 2000 = 1000.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of s'mores required and then determine how many boxes of graham crackers are needed to meet that demand.

First, let's calculate the total number of s'mores needed for the kids. Since each kid wants 2 s'mores, and there are 9 kids, the total number of s'mores needed for the kids is 9 * 2 = 18.

Next, let's calculate the total number of s'mores needed for the adults. Since each adult wants 1 s'more, and there are 6 adults, the total number of s'mores needed for the adults is 6 * 1 = 6.

Now, we add the number of s'mores needed for the kids and adults to get the total number of s'mores required: 18 + 6 = 24.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 s'mores, we need to divide the total number of s'mores required by 8 to determine the number of sleeves needed: 24 / 8 = 3.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need to divide the number of sleeves needed by 3 to determine the number of boxes required: 3 / 3 = 1.

Therefore, the number of boxes of graham crackers needed is 1.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the ages of Dora's father and mother. 

Given that Dora is 15 years old, we can use the information that Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age to find his age. 

Let's denote Dora's father's age as F and Dora's age as D. We have the equation: F = 2D + 8. 

Substituting Dora's age (D = 15) into the equation, we get F = 2(15) + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38. 

Now that we know Dora's father is 38 years old, we can find Dora's mother's age. We are given that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. 

Let's denote Dora's mother's age as M. We have the equation: M = F - 4. 

Substituting Dora's father's age (F = 38) into the equation, we get M = 38 - 4 = 34. 

Now that we know Dora's age (15), her father's age (38), and her mother's age (34), we can calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother. 

The total combined age is D + F + M = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87.

"This scenario presents a classic problem of distributive justice, where the goal is to divide a resource (in this case, the $20) fairly among a group of individuals. In this case, Greg wants to split the money equally among his 3 younger siblings.

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of division. Since there are 3 siblings and Greg wants to divide the money equally, we can divide the total amount of money ($20) by the number of siblings (3).

20 ÷ 3 = 6.67

However, since we cannot divide money into fractions, we can round down to the nearest whole number to ensure each sibling receives an equal share. 

6.67 ≈ 6.67 (rounding down is not possible in this case, so we will round down to 6 and then add the remainder to the next sibling)

Alternatively, we can divide the $20 into 3 parts and then add the remainder to the next sibling. 

$20 ÷ 3 = $6.67 (6 dollars and 2/3 dollars)

$6.67 = $6 (6 dollars) + $0.67 (2/3 dollars)

So, the first two siblings will get $6 each, and the third sibling will get $6 + $0.67 = $6.67.

However, if we are looking for a simple answer, we can say that each of the first two siblings will get $6 and the third sibling will get $6.67.

The final answer is: $6.67"
"To find the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying, we need to calculate the weight of each book and then add them together.

Cindy has 2 math and science books, so the total weight of these books is 2 * 2 = 4 pounds.

Her French book weighs 4 pounds and her English book weighs 3 pounds.

Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book, so the weight of the history book is 2 * 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of all the books together: 4 (math and science) + 4 (French) + 3 (English) + 6 (history) = 17 pounds.

The final answer is: 17"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many votes candidate B got. Since candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes, and candidate A got 20% of the votes, we can calculate candidate B's votes as follows:

Candidate A's votes = 20% of 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes
Candidate B's votes = 50% more than candidate A's votes = 20 + (50/100 * 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 votes

Now, we know that candidate B got 30 votes, and candidate A got 20 votes. To find out how many votes candidate C got, we need to subtract the total votes of A and B from the total number of voters:

Total votes of A and B = 20 + 30 = 50 votes
Total votes = 100
Candidate C's votes = Total votes - Total votes of A and B = 100 - 50 = 50 votes

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the initial number of apples Beck has. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we can calculate Beck's initial number of apples as follows:

Beck's initial apples = Boris's apples - 23
Beck's initial apples = 100 - 23
Beck's initial apples = 77

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. To find the new number of apples Beck has, we add 10 to Beck's initial number of apples:

Beck's new apples = Beck's initial apples + 10
Beck's new apples = 77 + 10
Beck's new apples = 87

Now, we need to find the difference between Boris's apples and Beck's new apples to determine how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris:

Difference = Boris's apples - Beck's new apples
Difference = 100 - 87
Difference = 13

The final answer is: 13"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract that from the total amount of water available (32 ounces).

First, let's calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube:

- Giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces/cube = 12 ounces
- Medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces/cube = 14 ounces
- Small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces/cube = 4 ounces

Now, let's add up the total amount of water used: 12 ounces + 14 ounces + 4 ounces = 30 ounces

Since Peter started with 32 ounces of water, we subtract the total amount used from the initial amount to find out how much water is left: 32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces

The final answer is: 2"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of books Steven has. Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven and Clara has 20 books, we can set up the equation 2x = 20, where x is the number of books Steven has. Solving for x, we get x = 20 / 2 = 10.

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can determine the number of books Alice has. Since Alice has 6 more books than Steven, we can set up the equation y = 10 + 6, where y is the number of books Alice has. Solving for y, we get y = 16.

Now that we know Alice has 16 books and Clara has 20 books, we can determine how many more books Clara has than Alice by subtracting the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has: 20 - 16 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $5 and it is $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can set up the following equation:

Gallon jar = Half-gallon jar + $2
$5 = Half-gallon jar + $2

To find the cost of a half-gallon jar, we need to subtract $2 from both sides of the equation:

Half-gallon jar = $5 - $2
Half-gallon jar = $3

Now that we know the cost of a half-gallon jar, we can calculate the total cost of 16 half-gallon jars:

16 * $3 = $48

Next, we need to find the cost of a 10-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $5, a 10-gallon jar would cost 10 times the cost of a gallon jar:

10 * $5 = $50

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money Cecelia spent on 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars:

Total cost = Cost of 10-gallon jars + Cost of 16 half-gallon jars
Total cost = $50 + $48
Total cost = $98

The final answer is: $98"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of students who like to play music. We are given that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is 2 * 5 = 10.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 50, and 10 like to bake, 5 like to play basketball, and 10 like to play music. To find the number of students who like to play video games, we need to subtract the number of students who like to bake, play basketball, and play music from the total number of students.

Number of students who like to play video games = Total number of students - (Number of students who like to bake + Number of students who like to play basketball + Number of students who like to play music)
= 50 - (10 + 5 + 10)
= 50 - 25
= 25

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Jeremy saw 12 birds in the backyard. When he threw a stone, he scared away 1/3 of that number. 

1/3 of 12 is calculated as 12 * (1/3) = 4. 

So, 4 birds were scared away, leaving 12 - 4 = 8 birds in the backyard.

A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds. 

Now, the total number of birds in the backyard is 8 (initially fearless birds) + 20 (new birds) = 28.

The final answer is: 28"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of girls in both classes. Since 40% of the students in each class are girls, and there are 80 students in total, we can set up an equation to represent the situation.

Let x be the number of students in each class. Since there are two classes, the total number of students is 2x. We know that 40% of 2x is the total number of girls in both classes. 

40% of 2x = 0.4 * 2x = 0.8x

We also know that the total number of students is 80, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 80

To find x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 80 / 2
x = 40

Now that we know there are 40 students in each class, we can find the number of boys in each class. Since 40% of the students are girls, 60% are boys. 

60% of 40 = 0.6 * 40 = 24

So, there are 24 boys in each class.

1. Mara added 3 slices to the plate, so now she has 2 + 3 = 5 slices.
2. Mara tripled the number of slices she currently has, so she now has 5 * 3 = 15 slices.
3. Mara ate 2 slices, so she now has 15 - 2 = 13 slices.
4. Her friend stole 5 slices off her plate, so she now has 13 - 5 = 8 slices.

The final number of cake slices that remained on the plate is 8."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of animals that need grooming and then divide that number by the number of days in a week (7).

First, let's calculate the total number of animals that need grooming:

- Dogs: 8
- Cats: 5
- Birds: 3
- Horses: 12

Total animals = 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of animals by 7 to find out how many animals Melissa will groom each day:

28 / 7 = 4

So, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week.

"To determine Mark's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the packs and the total value of the cards he obtained.

The total cost of the packs is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total value of the cards he obtained is $4000 + $1000 + (30 * $50) = $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500.

The total value of the cards is greater than the cost of the packs, so Mark made a profit. To find the profit, we subtract the cost of the packs from the total value of the cards: $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

The final answer is: $1100"

The family will be able to save $28 if they choose the second amusement park over the first."
"To determine the amount of money the tomato vendor saves per week, we need to calculate the daily savings and then multiply it by 7.

The vendor used to buy 500 tomatoes at $.5 each, so his daily cost was 500 * $.5 = $250.

With the new vendor, he buys the same 500 tomatoes at $.4 each, so his new daily cost is 500 * $.4 = $200.

The daily savings is the difference between the old cost and the new cost: $250 - $200 = $50.

To find the weekly savings, we multiply the daily savings by 7: $50 * 7 = $350.

The final answer is: $350"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of marbles Carl and Cal have. 

Since Sean has 56 marbles and he has half as many marbles as Cal, we can calculate Cal's marbles by doubling Sean's marbles. 

Cal's marbles = 2 * Sean's marbles
Cal's marbles = 2 * 56
Cal's marbles = 112

Now, we know that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. 

Carl's marbles = 4 * Sean's marbles
Carl's marbles = 4 * 56
Carl's marbles = 224

To find the combined total of Carl and Cal's marbles, we add their individual totals together.

Combined marbles = Carl's marbles + Cal's marbles
Combined marbles = 224 + 112
Combined marbles = 336

"To determine the number of groups needed, we first need to find out how many students are in each group. Since there are 54 students and they are to be separated into 6 groups of equal size, we divide 54 by 6.

54 ÷ 6 = 9

So, each group has 9 students. However, the activity requires 12 groups. To find out how many more groups are needed, we subtract the number of groups already formed (6) from the required number of groups (12).

12 - 6 = 6

Therefore, 6 more groups are needed to form.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of chairs rented in a month and then multiply it by 2, since we want to know the total for two months.

First, let's calculate the total number of chairs rented in a month. 

There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week. So, the number of weekdays in a month is 4 * 5 = 20, and the number of weekend days in a month is 4 * 2 = 8.

The total number of chairs rented in a month is the sum of chairs rented on weekdays and weekend days. 
Chairs rented on weekdays = 20 * 60 = 1200
Chairs rented on weekend days = 8 * 100 = 800
Total chairs rented in a month = 1200 + 800 = 2000

Now, we multiply the total chairs rented in a month by 2 to get the total for two months.
Total chairs rented in two months = 2000 * 2 = 4000

Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas.

1. Arnold stole half of the bananas from the pile. Half of 48 is 24, so Arnold stole 24 bananas. Gunther was left with 48 - 24 = 24 bananas.

2. Gunther added 25 bananas to his pile, making it 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.

3. Arnold stole 12 bananas from the pile, leaving Gunther with 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.

4. Gunther added 6 bananas to his pile, making it 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

Therefore, when Gunther began counting bananas, he found 43 bananas in the pile.

"To determine how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we need to first calculate the total annual electricity bill. Since the monthly electricity bill is $100, we multiply this by 12 to get the annual bill.

Annual electricity bill = $100/month * 12 months/year = $1200/year

Next, we divide the total annual bill by the number of roommates to find out how much each roommate will pay.

Annual payment per roommate = $1200/year / 4 roommates = $300/year

So, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

First, she trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 30 is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons.

Now, she has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

Now, she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the remaining large stickers for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she has 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 60 small buttons.

Now, let's count the total number of buttons she has: 27 small buttons + 20 large buttons + 60 small buttons = 107 buttons.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as 'x'. Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, the number of votes in favor can be represented as 2x.

The total number of council members is 33, and the sum of votes in favor and against the regulation should equal the total number of council members. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Since x represents the number of votes against the new regulation, the number of votes in favor is 2x. 

2x = 2 * 11
2x = 22

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, we know that 11 students need size extra-small. 

Next, we are told that twice as many students need size small as extra small. So, the number of students who need size small is 2 * 11 = 22.

Then, we are told that four less than the number of size small students need size medium. So, the number of students who need size medium is 22 - 4 = 18.

After that, we are told that half as many students need size large as size medium. So, the number of students who need size large is 18 / 2 = 9.

Finally, we are told that six more students need size extra-large than large. So, the number of students who need size extra-large is 9 + 6 = 15.

Now, we can add up the number of students who need each size to find the total number of shirts ordered: 11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. To find the number of people who think horse #2 will win, we multiply 50 by 0.2:

50 * 0.2 = 10

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Now, we need to find the number of people who are left. Since 10 people think horse #2 will win, we subtract 10 from 50:

50 - 10 = 40

These 40 people are the remaining people. Now, 60% of these 40 people think horse #7 will win. To find the number of people who think horse #7 will win, we multiply 40 by 0.6:

40 * 0.6 = 24

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

Now, we need to find the number of people who think horse #12 will win. We already know that 10 people think horse #2 will win and 24 people think horse #7 will win. To find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we subtract the number of people who think horse #2 and horse #7 will win from the total number of people:

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. 

Let's denote the total number of Pomeranians as P. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can set up the equation:

1/3 * P = 6

To solve for P, we can multiply both sides by 3:

P = 6 * 3
P = 18

So, there are 18 Pomeranians. Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let's denote the total number of puppies as J. We can set up the equation:

2/3 * J = 18

To solve for J, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

J = 18 * (3/2)
J = 27

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies.

Jayden initially had $70. His sister gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. 

So, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115.

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera: $200 - $115 = $85.

Therefore, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.

The final answer is: $85"
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknown quantities. Let's say the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house is x. Since the first house needs 1/2 of the second, the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house is x/2. The third house needs double the first, so the number of cases of shingles needed for the third house is 2 * (x/2) = x.

We know that the total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. We can write an equation to represent this:

x + (x/2) + x = 250

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + x + 2x = 500

Combine like terms:

5x = 500

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 100

Now that we know x, we can find the number of cases of shingles needed for the third house, which is x = 100.

The final answer is: 100"

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total amount of oranges needed to make 4 liters of juice. Since Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges to make 1 liter of juice, he would need 5 times as many kilograms of oranges to make 4 liters of juice. 

5 kilograms/liter * 4 liters = 20 kilograms of oranges

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the oranges. Each kilogram of oranges costs $3, so we multiply the total amount of oranges needed by the cost per kilogram.

20 kilograms * $3/kilogram = $60

Therefore, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many books Ahmed read in one hour. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, and Ezra read 300 books, we can set up the equation:

Ezra's books = 2 * Ahmed's books
300 = 2 * Ahmed's books

To find Ahmed's books, we divide both sides by 2:

Ahmed's books = 300 / 2
Ahmed's books = 150

Now that we know Ahmed read 150 books, we can find the total number of books they both read. Ezra decided to read 150 more books, so we add this to the 300 books he already read:

Ezra's total books = 300 + 150 = 450

Now we add Ahmed's books to Ezra's total books:

Total books = Ezra's total books + Ahmed's books
Total books = 450 + 150
Total books = 600

"To calculate Tanya's earnings, we need to break down her income into two parts: her hourly wage and her daily bonus.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total hourly earnings for Monday are 5 hours * $15/hour = $75. 

Additionally, she earns a daily bonus of $5 for teaching more than 3 classes. Since she teaches 4 classes on Monday, she earns the daily bonus, which is $5.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her total hourly earnings for Wednesday are 2 hours * $15/hour = $30.

Since she teaches fewer than 3 classes on Wednesday, she does not earn the daily bonus.

To find Tanya's total earnings for the two days, we add her earnings from Monday and Wednesday: $75 (Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) + $5 (Monday's daily bonus) = $110.

20 eggplants * $3/eggplant = $60

Bennet wants to make a total of $135, and he has already earned $60 from selling the eggplants. Therefore, the amount he needs to earn from selling the corn is:

$135 (total) - $60 (from eggplants) = $75

Since Bennet has 25 ears of corn, we can divide the amount he needs to earn from corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25) to find the price he should sell each ear of corn for:

$75 / 25 ears = $3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total time available for soccer, video games, and reading. Tatiana has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, for a total of 12 hours.

She reads for 3 hours, so the remaining time is 12 - 3 = 9 hours.

She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time, which is 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours.

The time left for soccer is 9 - 3 = 6 hours.

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we need to divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time available and multiply by 100.

(6 / 12) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, Anthony had 50 pencils.

He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, which is 50 * 1/2 = 25 pencils. So, he was left with 50 - 25 = 25 pencils.

Then, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. The remaining pencils are 25, and 3/5 of 25 is 25 * 3/5 = 15. So, he gave 15 pencils to Charlie.

Now, to find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we subtract the pencils he gave to Charlie from the remaining pencils: 25 - 15 = 10.

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time spent driving to the museum, the time spent at the museum, and the time spent driving back home.

The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and Jack drives at 75 mph. To find the time spent driving to the museum, we use the formula: time = distance / speed. 

Time to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours.

Since Jack spends 6 hours at the museum, we need to add the time spent driving back home to this. The distance back home is the same as the distance to the museum, 150 miles. 

Time back home = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours.

Total time spent driving = time to the museum + time back home = 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours.

Total time Jack is gone from home = time spent driving + time spent at the museum = 4 hours + 6 hours = 10 hours.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the toys and subtract that from the total number of wheels in the box.

First, let's calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars: 57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels.

Next, let's calculate the total number of wheels required for the motorcycles: 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels.

Now, let's add the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles: 228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels.

Since Henry has a box with 650 wheels, we subtract the total number of wheels required from the total number of wheels in the box: 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels.

The final answer is: 276"
"To determine the amount you have to pay after a 20% discount, we need to calculate 20% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

20% of $1000 is calculated as 0.20 * 1000 = $200.

Now, subtract the discount from the original price: $1000 - $200 = $800.

Therefore, you have to pay $800 after the 20% discount.

The final answer is: $800"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how many movies are in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of movies in series = Total movies / 3
= 600 / 3
= 200 movies

Since Mike can buy these series movies for $6 each, we can calculate the cost of these movies as follows:

Cost of series movies = Number of movies in series * $6
= 200 * $6
= $1200

Now, let's find out how many movies are not in series. We can do this by subtracting the number of movies in series from the total number of movies:

Number of movies not in series = Total movies - Number of movies in series
= 600 - 200
= 400 movies

Next, let's find out how many of these movies are older movies. Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of older movies = Number of movies not in series * 0.4
= 400 * 0.4
= 160 movies

Since older movies cost $5 each, we can calculate the cost of these movies as follows:

Cost of older movies = Number of older movies * $5
= 160 * $5
= $800

Now, let's find out how many movies are normal movies. We can do this by subtracting the number of older movies from the number of movies not in series:

Number of normal movies = Number of movies not in series - Number of older movies
= 400 - 160
= 240 movies

Since normal movies cost $10 each, we can calculate the cost of these movies as follows:

Cost of normal movies = Number of normal movies * $10
= 240 * $10
= $2400

Now, we can find the total cost of replacing the movies by adding the cost of series movies, older movies, and normal movies:

Total cost = Cost of series movies + Cost of older movies + Cost of normal movies
= $1200 + $800 + $2400
= $4400

The final answer is: $4400"
"To determine the total amount spent by Winston, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

The cost of peaches is 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00.
The cost of plums is 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00.
The cost of apricots is 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00.

Now, we add the costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00.

The final answer is: $38.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the speed at which the Llesis family hiked. We are given that they hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Their driving speed is 50 miles per hour. Half of 50 is 25, and 5 miles per hour less than that is 20 miles per hour.

Now, we know the time they spent hiking (1.5 hours) and their hiking speed (20 miles per hour). We can use the formula distance = speed * time to find the distance they hiked. 

distance = 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles

Next, we need to find the distance they drove. We know the total time they spent driving and hiking (6 hours) and the time they spent hiking (1.5 hours). So, the time they spent driving is 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours. We also know their driving speed (50 miles per hour). 

distance = speed * time
distance = 50 * 4.5
distance = 225 miles

Now, we need to find the total distance to their vacation spot. We can do this by adding the distance they hiked and the distance they drove.

total distance = 30 + 225
total distance = 255 miles

The final answer is: 255"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into components and calculate each player's score separately.

Let's denote Emma's number of enemies jumped as E, Ava's number of enemies jumped as A, Emma's number of berries collected as B, Ava's number of berries collected as a, Emma's time left on the timer as T, and Ava's time left on the timer as t.

We are given that Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so A = E + 8. We are also given that Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, so a = B + 3.

We are not given the exact values of E, B, T, or t, but we can express Ava's and Emma's scores in terms of these variables.

Emma's score = 10E + 5B + 30T
Ava's score = 10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(t - 4)

Simplifying Ava's score equation:
Ava's score = 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30t - 120
Ava's score = 10E + 5B + 30t - 25

Now, we can find the difference between their scores by subtracting Emma's score from Ava's score:
Difference = (10E + 5B + 30t - 25) - (10E + 5B + 30T)
Difference = 30t - 30T - 25

Since we are not given the exact values of t and T, we cannot find the exact difference. However, we can express the difference in terms of the time difference between Ava and Emma.

We are given that Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so t = T + 4. Substituting this into the difference equation:
Difference = 30(T + 4) - 30T - 25
Difference = 30T + 120 - 30T - 25
Difference = 95

The final answer is: 95"
"To solve this problem, we can start by finding the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each. 

Two pizzas at 30 dollars each will be 2 x 30 = 60 dollars.

Since the total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars, we can subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each from the total cost to find the cost of the other two pizzas.

64 - 60 = 4 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can divide the remaining cost by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

4 / 2 = 2 dollars.

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days, which is a total of 3 * 5 = 15 times.

On the two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which means they ride 2 * 3 = 6 times each day.

So, for these two days, they ride a total of 6 * 2 = 12 times.

Now, let's add the total number of times they ride on the usual days and the extra days: 15 + 12 = 27.

Therefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes a total of 27 times a week.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 7 fish in his pond, with 3 being orange and 4 being white.

Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as 'w' and the number of orange fish he bought as 'o'.

When Bob added the fish to his pond, he had a total of 7 + w + o fish.

Since he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

o = 2w

We also know that the total number of fish in the pond is the sum of the initial fish and the fish Bob bought, which is 7 + w + o.

Since the sales assistant at the pet store dipped out 17 fish, the total number of fish in the pond after adding the new fish is 7 + w + o = 7 + w + (17 - (3 + o)) (since 3 of the fish were orange and 4 were white, and the total number of fish dipped out was 17).

Simplifying the equation, we get:

7 + w + o = 7 + w + 17 - 3 - o
7 + w + o = 7 + w + 14 - o
o + o = 14
2o = 14
o = 7

Now that we know o = 7, we can substitute this value into the equation o = 2w:

7 = 2w
w = 7/2
w = 3.5

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a fish, we need to re-examine our equations.

Let's re-examine the equation 7 + w + o = 7 + w + (17 - (3 + o)).

Since the total number of fish dipped out was 17, and 3 of them were orange, the number of white fish dipped out is 17 - 3 = 14. However, we know that the number of white fish dipped out is equal to the number of white fish Bob bought plus the initial number of white fish in the pond, which is w + 4.

So, we can set up the equation:

w + 4 = 14
w = 10

Now that we know w = 10, we can substitute this value into the equation o = 2w:

o = 2(10)
o = 20

However, this is not possible since we know that o = 7.

Let's re-examine the equation o = 2w.

Since o = 7, we can substitute this value into the equation 7 + w + o = 7 + w + (17 - (3 + o)).

7 + w + 7 = 7 + w + 14 - 3 - o
14 + w = 7 + w + 11 - o
14 + w = 18 - o
14 + w = 18 - 7
14 + w = 11
w = -3

However, this is not possible since we cannot have a negative number of fish.

Let's re-examine the equation 7 + w + o = 7 + w + (17 - (3 + o)).

Since the total number of fish dipped out was 17, and 3 of them were orange, the number of white fish dipped out is 17 - 3 = 14. However, we know that the number of white fish dipped out is equal to the number of white fish Bob bought plus the initial number of white fish in the pond, which is w + 4.

So, we can set up the equation:

w + 4 = 14
w = 10

However, this is not possible since we know that o = 7.

Let's re-examine the equation o = 2w.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie had initially. She was given 10 twenties and 140 quarters.

The value of 10 twenties is 10 x $20 = $200.
The value of 140 quarters is 140 x $0.25 = $35.

So, the total amount of money Carrie had initially is $200 + $35 = $235.

Carrie spent all the quarters, which is $35, and 3/5 of the twenties, which is 3/5 x $200 = $120.

The total amount of money Carrie spent is $35 + $120 = $155.

Therefore, the total amount of money she paid for lunch is $155.

The final answer is: $155"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of tomatoes: 
5 tomato plants * 22 tomatoes per plant = 110 tomatoes

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggplants: 
8 eggplant plants * 4 eggplants per plant = 32 eggplants

Now, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants together: 
110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits

The final answer is: 142"
"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to determine the total percentage of TVs that are not OLED. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 or 0.25. One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 or 0.125. 

The total percentage of non-OLED TVs is the sum of the percentages of smart TVs and analog TVs: 0.25 + 0.125 = 0.375.

Since the total percentage of TVs must add up to 1, the percentage of OLED TVs is 1 - 0.375 = 0.625.

Now, we can find the number of OLED TVs sold by multiplying the total number of TVs sold (40) by the percentage of OLED TVs (0.625): 40 * 0.625 = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much of the trip's cost John needs to cover, and then subtract the amount he already has from that.

Since the school is covering half the cost, John is responsible for the other half. Half of $300 is $300 / 2 = $150.

John already has $50, so to find out how much more he needs, we subtract the amount he has from the amount he needs: $150 - $50 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the temperature at night and then calculate how many logs Carson needs to burn to reach the threshold of 32 degrees.

First, we know it was 45 degrees during the day and it's 33 degrees colder at night. So, the temperature at night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, Carson needs to heat the house to at least 32 degrees. To do this, he needs to raise the temperature from 12 degrees to 32 degrees. The difference in temperature is 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To raise the temperature by 20 degrees, Carson needs to burn 20 / 5 = 4 logs.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of groups formed. Since 90 people were divided into 9-person groups, we can find the number of groups by dividing 90 by 9.

90 people / 9 people per group = 10 groups

Next, we need to find out how many groups had members bring back 2 seashells each. Since 3/5 of the groups did this, we can multiply the total number of groups by 3/5.

3/5 * 10 groups = 6 groups

Now, we need to find out how many people were in these 6 groups. Since each group has 9 people, we can multiply the number of groups by 9.

6 groups * 9 people per group = 54 people

Since each of these 54 people brought back 2 seashells, we can multiply the number of people by 2 to find the total number of seashells.

54 people * 2 seashells per person = 108 seashells

The final answer is: 108"
"To solve this problem, we need to apply basic arithmetic operations. 

Initially, there are 172 people on the train. 

At the first stop, 47 people get off, so we subtract 47 from 172: 172 - 47 = 125. 

Then, 13 people get on the train, so we add 13 to 125: 125 + 13 = 138.

At the next stop, 38 people get off, so we subtract 38 from 138: 138 - 38 = 100.

Therefore, the number of people on the train is 100.

"This scenario presents an interesting case of economic activity, which can be analyzed through the lens of philosophical concepts such as value, utility, and the social contract. However, to provide a numerical answer, we can apply basic arithmetic.

First, let's calculate the daily earnings of Damien: 10 bottle caps * $0.25 per cap = $2.50 per day.

To find the total earnings for a 30-day month, we multiply the daily earnings by the number of days: $2.50 * 30 = $75.

Therefore, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month."
"To determine Jamie's total earnings for last Tuesday, we need to calculate her earnings for the regular 8 hours and the additional 3 hours.

Her regular hourly rate is $20. For the first 8 hours, she earns 8 * $20 = $160.

For the additional 3 hours, she is paid 150% of her regular hourly rate, which is 1.5 * $20 = $30 per hour. For the additional 3 hours, she earns 3 * $30 = $90.

To find her total earnings, we add the earnings from the regular hours and the additional hours: $160 + $90 = $250.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of lions in the enclosure. 

First, we know there are 12 female lions. The problem states that there are half as many male lions as female lions. So, the number of male lions is 12 / 2 = 6.

Next, we are told there are 14 lion cubs.

To find the total number of lions, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs together: 12 (female) + 6 (male) + 14 (cubs) = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans and then determine how much change Mike will receive after paying with a $50 bill.

First, let's calculate the discounted price of the jeans. The original price is $40, and it's 25% off. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (25% or 0.25):

Discount = $40 * 0.25 = $10

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price:

Discounted price = $40 - $10 = $30

Since Mike pays with a $50 bill, we need to find the change he will receive. To do this, we subtract the discounted price from the $50 bill:

Change = $50 - $30 = $20

Therefore, Mike will have $20 left over after paying for the jeans.

The final answer is: $20"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of employees after three months and then multiply it by the monthly salary of each employee.

The company initially has 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. So, after one month, the total number of employees will be 200 + 20 = 220. After two months, it will be 220 + 20 = 240, and after three months, it will be 240 + 20 = 260.

Now, we multiply the total number of employees after three months by the monthly salary of each employee: 260 * 4000 = 1,040,000.

The final answer is: 1,040,000"
"To determine the total time the choir will be caroling, we need to calculate the total time spent singing ""Deck the Halls"" and ""Jingle Bells."" 

Since ""Deck the Halls"" is sung twice, we multiply its duration by 2: 150 seconds * 2 = 300 seconds.

Then, we add the duration of ""Jingle Bells"" to the total time spent singing ""Deck the Halls"": 300 seconds + 240 seconds = 540 seconds.

Therefore, the choir will be caroling for 540 seconds.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total earnings of both Billy and Sally after working 20 hours.

Billy's initial hourly wage is $10. After 2 months, he gets a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new hourly wage $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. On his first anniversary, he gets another raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final hourly wage $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Billy's total earnings for 20 hours of work can be calculated as follows:
$11.50 * 20 = $230.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, which was $10. So, Sally's starting salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. 

Sally's total earnings for 20 hours of work can be calculated as follows:
$10.50 * 20 = $210.

To find out how much more money Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings:
$230 - $210 = $20.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find half of Pierson's score: 278 / 2 = 139.
2. Then, we add 11 to this result to find Nikita's score: 139 + 11 = 150.

Now that we know Nikita's score, we can find the total score of both Pierson and Nikita by adding their scores together: 278 (Pierson's score) + 150 (Nikita's score) = 428.

"To determine the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students. There are 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class. So, the total number of students is 40 * 25 = 1000.

Since each student plants one tree, the total number of trees planted by the students is 1000.

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers. There are 40 classes with an average of 3 teachers per class. So, the total number of teachers is 40 * 3 = 120.

Since each teacher plants two trees, the total number of trees planted by the teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

Now, we add the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers to get the total number of trees planted. Total trees = 1000 (students) + 240 (teachers) = 1240.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has. 

She has 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find out how many stuffed goats she needs to buy so that the percentage of stuffed goats is 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. 

Let's assume the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy is 'x'. 

The total number of stuffed animals after buying 'x' goats will be 14 + x.

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. 

So, we can set up the equation: (x / (14 + x)) * 100 = 30

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by (14 + x) to get rid of the fraction: x * 100 = 30 * (14 + x)

Now, we can expand the right-hand side: 100x = 420 + 30x

Next, we can subtract 30x from both sides to get: 70x = 420

Now, we can divide both sides by 70 to solve for 'x': x = 420 / 70

x = 6

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total hours Kris has played and subtract that from the target of 30 hours.

First, let's calculate the hours Kris played in the first 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days. If Kris plays for half an hour every day, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in the first 2 weeks.

Next, let's calculate the hours Kris played in the next week. If Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in the next week.

Now, let's add the hours Kris played in both periods: 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we subtract the total hours played from the target of 30 hours: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

Therefore, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the relative motion of the two cars. Since the second car is traveling at a higher speed, it will eventually overtake the first car. 

Let's denote the initial distance between the two cars as 'd'. After 2 hours, the first car will have traveled 60 * 2 = 120 miles, and the second car will have traveled 70 * 2 = 140 miles. 

The distance between the two cars after 2 hours will be the difference between the distances traveled by the two cars, which is 140 - 120 = 20 miles.

However, this is not the correct answer because we need to consider the initial distance 'd' between the two cars. The correct answer is the difference between the distances traveled by the two cars plus the initial distance 'd'. 

Since we don't know the initial distance 'd', we can express the final distance between the two cars as 140 - 120 + d = 20 + d.

However, we can also express the distance between the two cars as the difference in their speeds multiplied by the time, which is (70 - 60) * 2 = 20 miles. 

Since the difference in their speeds multiplied by the time is equal to the difference in the distances traveled by the two cars, we can equate the two expressions and solve for 'd'. 

20 + d = 20
d = 0

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade:

- Third-graders: 340 passed out of 500
- Fourth-graders: 40 passed out of 100
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice the fourth-graders', so it's 2 * 40 = 80 out of 400

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed:
340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 80 (fifth-graders) = 460

Next, let's calculate the total number of students in the school:
500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of square inches in the mosaic and then calculate how many inches of length Milo can make with the available glass chips.

First, let's find the total number of square inches in the mosaic. Since Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall, and it takes 12 chips to make every square inch, the total number of square inches in the mosaic is 3 * 12 = 36 square inches.

Now, let's calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has. He has two bags of glass chips, and each bag holds 72 chips. So, the total number of chips is 2 * 72 = 144 chips.

Since it takes 12 chips to make every square inch, the total number of square inches Milo can make is 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Since the mosaic is three inches tall, and Milo can make 12 square inches, the length of the mosaic will be 12 square inches / 3 inches (height) = 4 inches.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students. 

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so the total amount of tea consumed by these students is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.

Sixteen students drank 2 quarts each, so the total amount of tea consumed by these students is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we know that 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts. 

So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party in gallons is 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

- At the end of February, the number of students doubles again, so there are 20 * 2 = 40 students.
- At the end of March, the number of students doubles again, so there are 40 * 2 = 80 students.
- At the end of April, the number of students doubles again, so there are 80 * 2 = 160 students.
- At the end of May, the number of students doubles again, so there are 160 * 2 = 320 students.

Now, to find the number of additional students who joined by the end of May, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May: 320 - 10 = 310.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week. Since he made $105 and charges $0.25 per branch, we can divide the total amount made by the cost per branch to find the total number of branches.

Total amount made: $105
Cost per branch: $0.25

Total number of branches = Total amount made / Cost per branch
Total number of branches = 105 / 0.25
Total number of branches = 420

Since Felix worked for 7 days during the week, we can find the average number of branches he climbed per day by dividing the total number of branches by 7.

Average number of branches per day = Total number of branches / 7
Average number of branches per day = 420 / 7
Average number of branches per day = 60

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean, and then subtract the number of marshmallows dropped on the ground. 

John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores, so together they made 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they used 18 marshmallows. 

They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. So, the total number of marshmallows used or dropped is 18 + 3 = 21.

The bag originally had 35 marshmallows. To find the number of marshmallows left, we subtract the number of marshmallows used or dropped from the original number: 35 - 21 = 14.

Since there are 14 marshmallows left, and there are two kids, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to find out how many each kid can have: 14 / 2 = 7.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person plays and then determine how many quarters are used.

Jack plays for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. Since he can play for 20 minutes with one quarter, he uses 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

One of his friends is significantly worse and can play for half as long as Jack, so they play for 240 / 2 = 120 minutes. This friend uses 120 / 20 = 6 quarters.

The other two friends are significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they play for 240 * 1.5 = 360 minutes each. Each of these friends uses 360 / 20 = 18 quarters.

Since there are two friends who play for 360 minutes, they use a total of 2 * 18 = 36 quarters.

The total number of quarters used is 12 (Jack) + 6 (worse friend) + 36 (better friends) = 54 quarters.

The cost of each quarter is not specified, but we can still determine the total number of quarters used.

"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknown quantities. Let's say the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) is z, the amount of salt (and sugar) is s, and the amount of oil is o.

We are given that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so z = fragrance. We are also given that she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so s = sugar.

We are told that she uses twice as much oil as salt, so o = 2s. We are also told that she uses twice as much salt as zest, so s = 2z.

Now we can substitute the expression for s in terms of z into the expression for o: o = 2(2z) = 4z.

We are also given that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, and the total amount is the sum of the amounts of each ingredient. So, z + s + o + z + s + z = 10.

Substituting the expressions for s and o in terms of z, we get z + 2z + 4z + z + 2z + z = 10.

Combining like terms, we get 11z = 10.

Dividing both sides by 11, we get z = 10/11.

Now that we have the value of z, we can find the value of o by substituting z into the expression o = 4z: o = 4(10/11) = 40/11.

To convert this to a decimal, we can divide the numerator by the denominator: o ≈ 3.636.

However, since the question asks for the answer in a specific format, we will provide the answer as a fraction.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2: 40 * 0.2 = 8. So, Joe sells 8 cars.

3. Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

4. To find out how many cars Joe has left, we subtract the number of cars he sold and gave away from the total number of cars he had initially: 40 - 8 - 16 = 16.

Therefore, Joe remains with 16 cars after selling and giving some to his mother.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the time Sandy walked on the second day. Since she walked half as many hours on the second day as she walked on the first day, and she walked 8 hours on the first day, she walked 8 / 2 = 4 hours on the second day.

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is the sum of the time she walked on the first day and the time she walked on the second day. 

Total time = 8 hours + 4 hours = 12 hours

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time from hours to minutes by multiplying by 60.

Total time in minutes = 12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, Hunter counted 50 cars in the parking lot when he entered class.

During the first break, he counted 20 more cars, so the total number of cars becomes 50 + 20 = 70.

When he got out of class for the lunch break, he realized that 1/2 the number of cars in the parking lot had gone. This means that 1/2 of 70 cars left, and the remaining 1/2 stayed.

To find the number of cars that left, we multiply 70 by 1/2, which is the same as dividing 70 by 2. So, 70 / 2 = 35 cars left.

Since 1/2 of the cars left, the other 1/2 stayed. Therefore, the number of cars that stayed is also 35.

Now, to find the total number of cars he counted during lunch break, we need to add the number of cars that left and the number of cars that stayed. However, the question asks for the total number of cars he counted during lunch break, which is the number of cars that stayed plus the number of cars that left.

So, the total number of cars he counted during lunch break is 35 (cars that stayed) + 35 (cars that left) = 70.

"To determine how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a day and then multiply that by the number of days he works in a week.

First, let's find out how many tasks John completes in a day. Since he does 30 cycles of work a day and each cycle has 5 tasks, we multiply the number of cycles by the number of tasks per cycle:

30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day

Now, we know that each task pays $1.20. To find out how much John makes in a day, we multiply the number of tasks he completes by the pay per task:

150 tasks/day * $1.20/task = $180/day

Since John works a full 7-day week, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days he works:

$180/day * 7 days/week = $1260/week

Therefore, John makes $1260 in a week.

The final answer is: $1260"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine Sasha's scores in both games and then add them together.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add her scores together: 14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total number of tins of cat food, we multiply the number of packages of cat food by the number of tins per package: 8 * 11 = 88.

To find the total number of tins of dog food, we multiply the number of packages of dog food by the number of tins per package: 6 * 6 = 36.

To find the difference between the number of tins of cat food and dog food, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food: 88 - 36 = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations. Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as 'x'. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Since PJ has x cards, Smendrick has 3x cards, and Becca has 3x + 12 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has by substituting x = 47 into the equation for Becca's cards:

Becca's cards = 3(47) + 12
Becca's cards = 141 + 12
Becca's cards = 153

The final answer is: 153"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, we know Cindy had 5 green eggs. 
Since she had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs. 
Next, she had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs. 
Lastly, she had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, we need to add up the total number of eggs Cindy had: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To determine the amount Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and subtract the refund she will receive from Amazon.

First, let's calculate the cost of shipping:

Cost per pound: $0.35
Weight of the book: 4 pounds
Cost of shipping = 4 pounds * $0.35/pound = $1.40

Cost per mile: $0.08
Distance to the distribution center: 20 miles
Cost of shipping = 20 miles * $0.08/mile = $1.60

Total cost of shipping = $1.40 + $1.60 = $2.00

Now, let's calculate the refund Milly will receive from Amazon:

Purchase price of the book: $32
Refund percentage: 75%
Refund amount = $32 * 0.75 = $24

To find out how much Milly will lose, we subtract the refund amount from the total cost of shipping:

Loss = Total cost of shipping - Refund amount
Loss = $2.00 - $24 (this is incorrect, we need to calculate the loss as the difference between the shipping cost and the refund amount, but the refund amount is less than the shipping cost, so the

"This question appears to be a simple arithmetic problem, but let's break it down step by step from a philosophical perspective.

In this scenario, we can apply the concept of causality, where the initial conditions (Mulan's initial amount of money and her father's gift) lead to a series of events (buying jeans and a bag). The outcome (Mulan's remaining money) is a result of these events.

First, we need to establish the initial conditions: Mulan starts with $40, and her father gives her $100. This brings her total to $140.

Next, we apply the concept of causality, where the event of buying two pairs of jeans at $30 each and a bag for $20 occurs. The total cost of these items is 2 * $30 + $20 = $80.

Now, we subtract the total cost from Mulan's initial amount after receiving the gift: $140 - $80 = $60.

Therefore, from a philosophical perspective, we can see that the initial conditions and the events that occurred led to Mulan having $60 left.

The final answer is: $60"
"To solve this problem, we need to break down the production of chocolate bars for each week and then determine the production for the fourth week.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find the total production for the first three weeks, we add the production of each week: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month, we can find the production for the fourth week by subtracting the total production of the first three weeks from the total monthly production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

The final answer is: 14,000"
"To calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on TikTok in a week and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the time she spends on TikTok in a week:

- Britany records 18 videos, each taking 4 minutes. So, the total time spent recording videos is 18 * 4 = 72 minutes.
- She spends 2 hours writing songs, which is equivalent to 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.
- She spends 15 minutes each day for 6 days on makeup, so the total time spent on makeup is 15 * 6 = 90 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time spent on TikTok-related activities in a week:
72 (recording) + 120 (writing songs) + 90 (makeup) = 282 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 282 minutes to hours:
282 / 60 = 4.7 hours

Now, let's multiply the time spent on TikTok in a week by 4 to get the time spent in a month:
4.7 hours/week * 4 weeks/month = 18.8 hours

The final answer is: 18.8"
"To determine the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. However, Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. Since the initial installation already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier, we only need to consider the additional items.

Angela has 2 extra mirrors (6 - 4 = 2), 1 extra chandelier (2 - 1 = 1), and 10 extra pictures (20 - 10 = 10). The cost of the additional items is $15.00 per item.

The total number of additional items is 2 (mirrors) + 1 (chandelier) + 10 (pictures) = 13 items.

The cost of the additional items is 13 items * $15.00 per item = $195.00.

The initial installation cost is $129.00.

The total cost is the sum of the initial installation cost and the cost of the additional items: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

The final answer is: $324.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Eva has saved $20.00.
2. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.
3. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply $30.00 by 0.4: $30.00 * 0.4 = $12.00.
4. To find the total amount Roy has saved, we add the 40% more to Anthony's savings: $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

The final answer is: $42.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish a hierarchy of lifting abilities based on the given information. 

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 since there are 12 inches in a foot. 

480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is: 40"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of distance = speed * time. 

First, let's calculate the distance Mason traveled in the first 4 hours: 
Distance = speed * time = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance Mason traveled in the next 6 hours: 
Distance = speed * time = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles.

Now, we add the distances traveled in both segments to find the total distance: 
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles.

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the time it takes for one kangaroo to travel across the highway. Since three kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, one kangaroo would take three times as long, which is 18 * 3 = 54 hours.

Now, we know that the turtles travel at half the speed of a kangaroo. Therefore, if one kangaroo takes 54 hours to travel across the highway, four turtles traveling at half the speed would take twice as long, which is 54 * 2 = 108 hours.

The final answer is: 108"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of clay dishes each person made and then add them together.

We know that Kora made 20 dishes. Since Rory made 20 more clay dishes than Kora, Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.

Jada made twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

To find the total number of clay dishes they made, we add the number of dishes each person made: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The original price of the laptop is $600.
2. The price is reduced by $200 when Erika trades in her old laptop, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, so she must have $400 - $50 = $350.
4. Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom has given her $80, so she has $150 + $80 = $230 from these sources.
5. Since Erika must have $350 in total and she has $230 from her job and her mom, the amount she has in her purse is $350 - $230 = $120.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of slices Adam gets from the large and small apples, and then subtract the number of slices he eats.

First, let's calculate the total number of slices from the large apples: 3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices.

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices from the small apples: 5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices.

Now, let's add the total number of slices from the large and small apples: 15 slices (large) + 15 slices (small) = 30 slices.

Finally, let's subtract the number of slices Adam eats: 30 slices - 15 slices = 15 slices.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total amount of milk the farmer currently produces with his 3 cows. Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, the total amount of milk produced by 3 cows is 3 * 5 = 15 liters per day.

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk per day. To find out how many more cows he needs, we need to calculate the difference between the desired amount of milk and the current amount of milk produced.

Desired milk production: 25 liters
Current milk production: 15 liters

Difference: 25 - 15 = 10 liters

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, we need to find out how many cows are required to produce 10 liters of milk per day.

Number of cows needed to produce 10 liters: 10 / 5 = 2

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk per day.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, which is equivalent to 1/6 * 12 = 2 millimeters.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, which is equivalent to 2/3 * 12 = 8 millimeters.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, which is equivalent to 1/2 * 12 = 6 millimeters.

Now, let's add the unused portions together: 2 + 8 + 6 = 16 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters.

"To determine how much money Gabriel still needs, we must first calculate the total amount of money he has available. 

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200. 

Total money available = $5000 + $200 = $5200

The total cost of the items Gabriel wants to buy is $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10800.

To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we subtract the total money available from the total cost of the items.

Money still needed = Total cost - Total money available
Money still needed = $10800 - $5200
Money still needed = $5600

The final answer is: $5600"
"To determine the change Thea received, we need to calculate the total amount she paid and subtract it from the amount she gave the craftsman.

Thea gave the craftsman four $20 bills, which is 4 * $20 = $80.

The hat cost $70, so the change she received is $80 - $70 = $10.

The final numerical answer is: $10"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the squirt guns. Craig buys 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so the total cost of the squirt guns is 6 * 2 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the water balloons. Craig buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so the total cost of the water balloons is 3 * 3 = $9.

Now, let's add the cost of the squirt guns and the water balloons to find the total cost of the items Craig bought. The total cost is $12 + $9 = $21.

Craig initially had 2 twenty-dollar bills, which is equivalent to 2 * 20 = $40.

To find out how much money Craig has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the initial amount of money he had. So, Craig has $40 - $21 = $19 left.

The final answer is: $19"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of socks Jack has as 'S' and the number of dishes Jack has as 'D'. We are given that Jack collected 60 dishes, so D = 60.

We are also given that Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so D = 2S. Since D = 60, we can substitute this value into the equation to get 60 = 2S. Solving for S, we get S = 30.

Now, we are given that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 2S socks. Since S = 30, Peter has 2 * 30 = 60 socks.

We are also given that Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has D/2 dishes. Since D = 60, Peter has 60/2 = 30 dishes.

To find the total number of socks and dishes they have together, we add the number of socks and dishes that Jack and Peter have. Jack has S + D = 30 + 60 = 90 items. Peter has 60 + 30 = 90 items. 

The total number of items they have together is 90 + 90 = 180.

The final answer is: 180"
"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of set theory, specifically the concept of the union and intersection of sets. Let's denote the set of students good at math as M and the set of students good at English as E.

We know that the total number of students is 20. We also know that 5 students are good at math only (M - E) and 8 students are good at English only (E - M). The rest of the students are good at both math and English, which is the intersection of M and E (M ∩ E).

Let's denote the number of students good at both math and English as x. Then, the total number of students can be represented as:

|M ∪ E| = |M| + |E| - |M ∩ E|

where |M ∪ E| is the total number of students, |M| is the number of students good at math, |E| is the number of students good at English, and |M ∩ E| is the number of students good at both.

We know that |M ∪ E| = 20, |M - E| = 5, and |E - M| = 8. We can rewrite the equation as:

20 = |M| + |E| - x

Since |M - E| = 5, we can say that |M| = 5 + x. Similarly, since |E - M| = 8, we can say that |E| = 8 + x.

Substituting these expressions into the equation, we get:

20 = (5 + x) + (8 + x) - x

Combine like terms:

20 = 13 + 2x

Subtract 13 from both sides:

7 = 2x

Divide both sides by 2:

3.5 = x

However, x represents the number of students good at both math and English, not the total number of students good at math. To find the total number of students good at math, we need to add the number of students good at math only (5) to the number of students good at both math and English (x).

|Math| = |M - E| + |M ∩ E|
= 5 + 3.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we can round down to the nearest whole number, as you can't have a fraction of a person. However, in this case, we can also consider that the question asks for the number of students good at math, and the 3.5 represents the number of students good at both subjects. This means that 3.5 students are counted twice in the total number of students good at math. To find the total number of students good at math, we can add 3.5 to the number of students good at math only (5), but since we can't have a fraction of a student, we can consider that the 3.5 represents the number of students good at both subjects, and we can round down to the nearest whole number.

"To determine the number of groups that can perform, we need to calculate the total available time for performances. The concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes. Subtracting the 10-minute intermission, we have 120 - 10 = 110 minutes available for performances.

Each group requires 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage, totaling 10 minutes per group. 

Now, we can divide the total available time for performances (110 minutes) by the time required per group (10 minutes) to find the maximum number of groups that can perform:

110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups

The final answer is: 11"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of simple interest. Simple interest is calculated as a percentage of the principal amount, and in this case, the interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year.

Let's break it down:

Year 1: Principal = $300, Interest = 3/4 * $300 = $225, Total = $300 + $225 = $525
Year 2: Principal = $525, Interest = 3/4 * $525 = $393.75, Total = $525 + $393.75 = $918.75
Year 3: Principal = $918.75, Interest = 3/4 * $918.75 = $344.0625, Total = $918.75 + $344.0625 = $1262.8125

So, after 3 years, Brenda will have a total of $1262.81."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of white shirts with collars and the number of floral shirts with buttons. 

Since half of the white shirts have collars, the number of white shirts with collars is 40 / 2 = 20. 

The number of white shirts without collars is 40 - 20 = 20.

The number of floral shirts with buttons is given as 20.

To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we subtract the number of floral shirts with buttons from the total number of floral shirts: 50 - 20 = 30.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars. 

The difference is 30 - 20 = 10.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of trays the farmer can fill with 900 eggs, and then calculate the total earnings from selling those trays.

Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs (900) by the number of eggs per tray (30) to find the number of trays:

900 eggs / 30 eggs per tray = 30 trays

Now, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray ($2.5):

30 trays * $2.5 per tray = $75

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of goats sold from each farm and then subtract that from the initial number of goats in each farm. 

First, let's calculate the number of goats sold from each farm. Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X. He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y.

Now, let's calculate the number of goats left in each farm. In Farm X, he had 55 goats initially and sold 10, so he has 55 - 10 = 45 goats left. In Farm Y, he had 45 goats initially and sold 20, so he has 45 - 20 = 25 goats left.

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the number of goats left in each farm: 45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount spent on shoes per year by the number of pairs bought per year.

First, let's calculate the number of pairs James buys per year: 2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year.

Now, we can divide the total amount spent per year by the number of pairs bought per year: $2640/year ÷ 24 pairs/year = $110/pair.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the green baskets and the red baskets separately, and then subtract the discount for the red baskets.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 x $25 = $75.

The cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 x $18 = $54.

Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, the total discount is 3 x $2 = $6.

The total cost of the red baskets after the discount is $54 - $6 = $48.

The total cost of all the baskets is $75 + $48 = $123.

Therefore, you will have to pay $123 in total.

The final answer is: $123"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of rooms that need to be cleaned, which is half of the total number of rooms. 

Half of 90 rooms is 90 / 2 = 45 rooms.

Next, we need to calculate the total time it takes to clean these rooms. It takes 20 minutes to clean each room, so we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room.

45 rooms * 20 minutes per room = 900 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours.

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes. 

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will count the total number of homes built in the first two years, which is 12 + 36 = 48 homes, and then double this amount, resulting in 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to add the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. I am three years younger than my brother.
2. I am 2 years older than my sister.
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age.
4. The sum of all our ages is 87.

Let's denote my age as 'x'. Since I am three years younger than my brother, my brother's age is 'x + 3'. Since I am 2 years older than my sister, my sister's age is 'x - 2'. 

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so her age is 3(x + 3) - 1.

The sum of all our ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 10 + 3x - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms again: 8x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 8x = 78.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 9.75.

Since age cannot be a fraction, we need to re-examine the equation. The issue lies in the fact that we assumed the ages are integers. Let's re-examine the equation: 8x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 8x = 78.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 9.75.

However, since age cannot be a fraction, we need to re-examine the problem. Let's try to find the closest integer solution. We can round x to the nearest integer, but we need to check if it satisfies the original equation.

Let's try x = 9 and x = 10.

If x = 9, then the brother's age is 12, the sister's age is 7, and the mom's age is 35. The sum of their ages is 63, which is less than 87.

If x = 10, then the brother's age is 13, the sister's age is 8, and the mom's age is 38. The sum of their ages is 59, which is less than 87.

If x = 11, then the brother's age is 14, the sister's age is 9, and the mom's age is 41. The sum of their ages is 65, which is less than 87.

If x = 12, then the brother's age is 15, the sister's age is 10, and the mom's age is 44. The sum of their ages is 71, which is less than 87.

If x = 13, then the brother's age is 16, the sister's age is 11, and the mom's age is 47. The sum of their ages is 76, which is less than 87.

If x = 14, then the brother's age is 17, the sister's age is 12, and the mom's age is 50. The sum of their ages is 81, which is less than 87.

If x = 15, then the brother's age is 18, the sister's age is 13, and the mom's age is 53. The sum of their ages is 86, which is less than 87.

If x = 16, then the brother's age is 19, the sister's age is 14, and the mom's age is 56. The sum of their ages is 91, which is greater than 87.

Since x = 16 does not satisfy the equation, we need to try x = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of glue sticks required and then divide that by the number of glue sticks per pack, rounding up to the nearest whole number since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs.

First, we calculate the total number of glue sticks needed: 27 students * 2 glue sticks per student = 54 glue sticks.

Since glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack: 54 / 8 = 6.75.

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we need to consider that 6 packs would give us 6 * 8 = 48 glue sticks, which is less than the 54 needed. 

To find the minimum number of packs needed, we can calculate the remainder when 54 is divided by 8, which is 6. This means we need 6 more glue sticks. Since 6 glue sticks is less than 8, we can buy one more pack to have the extra glue sticks. 

Therefore, Mr. Jackson needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of change in the amount of water passing through the river. 

Initially, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons. 

On the second day, the amount of water doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point on the third day is 14000 gallons.

The final answer is: 14000"
"This problem can be approached using exponential growth, a concept often discussed in the context of population growth and epidemiology. The key idea is that the number of infected individuals at each time step is a multiple of the number of infected individuals at the previous time step.

Let's denote the initial number of infected people as I0 = 10. The number of people infected after one day is I1 = 10 * 6 = 60. 

To find the number of people infected after two days, we need to consider that each of the 60 people from the previous day infects 6 others. So, I2 = 60 * 6 = 360.

For the third day, each of the 360 people from the previous day infects 6 others. Therefore, I3 = 360 * 6 = 2160.

The final answer is: 2160"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Rafaela received in tips. Since each of the 40 customers gave her a $20 tip, we can multiply the number of customers by the amount of the tip to find the total amount of money Rafaela received.

Rafaela's tips = 40 customers * $20/customer = $800

Now, we need to find out how much money Julieta received in tips. We are told that Julieta received 10% less money than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's tips, we can multiply Rafaela's tips by 0.1.

10% of Rafaela's tips = $800 * 0.1 = $80

Now, we need to subtract this amount from Rafaela's tips to find out how much money Julieta received.

Julieta's tips = Rafaela's tips - 10% of Rafaela's tips
= $800 - $80
= $720

Now, we need to find the total amount of money both Rafaela and Julieta received as tips. We can do this by adding their tips together.

Total tips = Rafaela's tips + Julieta's tips
= $800 + $720
= $1520

The final answer is: $1520"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of oranges Jennifer gave away and subtract that from the initial number of oranges she bought.

First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Jennifer gave to her daughters: 3 daughters * 2 oranges per daughter = 6 oranges.

Then, she gave 3 oranges to her boy. So, the total number of oranges given away is 6 (to daughters) + 3 (to the boy) = 9 oranges.

Now, we subtract the total number of oranges given away from the initial number of oranges Jennifer bought: 12 (initial oranges) - 9 (oranges given away) = 3 oranges.

Therefore, Jennifer remained with 3 oranges.

The final answer is: 3"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Claire earns 1 badge per month. 
Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.
Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), Claire will earn 12 badges.
Amber will earn 12 * (1/2) = 6 badges.
Wendy will earn 12 * 3 = 36 badges.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of slices Paige baked and then multiply it by the price per slice.

First, let's find out how many hours Paige baked. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours.

Since Paige can bake 2 loaves per hour, and each loaf is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices she can bake per hour is 2 * 8 = 16 slices.

In 5 hours, she can bake 16 * 5 = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, so the total amount raised is 80 * 0.5 = 40 dollars.

The final answer is: $40"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of silver coins Gretchen has. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, and Gretchen has 70 gold coins, we can set up an equation to represent the relationship between the number of gold and silver coins.

Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Then, the number of gold coins is 'x + 30'. We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 70

To solve for 'x', we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

x = 70 - 30
x = 40

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins.

Now, to find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and silver coins:

Total coins = Number of gold coins + Number of silver coins
Total coins = 70 + 40
Total coins = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of burritos given to the students. Since there were 50 students and each student was given 10 burritos, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Next, we need to add the number of burritos Mr. George ate, which is 20. However, since Mr. George is also a student in this context, we should not add his burritos to the total number of burritos given to the students. Instead, we should subtract the number of burritos Mr. George ate from the total number of burritos ordered.

The total number of burritos ordered is 600. The number of burritos given to the students and Mr. George is 500. The number of burritos left over is 600 - 500 = 100.

However, we also need to subtract the number of burritos Mr. George ate from the total number of burritos ordered. So, the total number of leftover burritos is 600 - 500 - 20 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we can start by identifying the number of green cars, which is 2 fewer than the number of red cars. Since there are 12 red cars, the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

Next, we are told that the rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as it has green cars. Therefore, the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

We know that the total number of cars in the rink is 75. We have already accounted for 12 red cars, 10 green cars, and 30 blue cars. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the total number of non-yellow cars from the total number of cars in the rink: 75 - (12 + 10 + 30) = 75 - 52 = 23.

Therefore, the rink has 23 yellow cars.

The final answer is: 23"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations. Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S.

We are given the following information:

1. S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
2. A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)
3. S + A + F = 85 (Together, they have 85 books)

We can substitute the first equation into the third equation to get:
(A + 25) + A + F = 85
Combine like terms:
2A + F + 25 = 85

Now, substitute the second equation into the above equation:
2(F - 12) + F + 25 = 85
Expand the equation:
2F - 24 + F + 25 = 85
Combine like terms:
3F + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:
3F = 84

Divide both sides by 3:
F = 28

The final answer is: 28"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the weight of the sweet potatoes and then subtract 3 pounds from that weight to find the weight of the carrots.

The weight of the potatoes is given as 5 pounds. The weight of the sweet potatoes is 2 times the weight of the potatoes, so it is 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

The weight of the carrots is 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so it is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Therefore, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of jello cups needed and then calculate the total cost.

First, we need to find out how many jello cups Greg needs in total. Since there are 30 kids and each kid will get 4 jello cups, the total number of jello cups needed is 30 * 4 = 120.

Since one 3-ounce box of flavored jello makes 10 small jello cups, we need to find out how many boxes of jello Greg needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total number of jello cups needed by the number of jello cups one box makes: 120 / 10 = 12.

Now, we know that Greg needs 12 boxes of jello. Since each box costs $1.25, the total cost will be 12 * $1.25 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"This question seems to be a simple arithmetic problem, but let's break it down step by step.

The electronics seller bought 5 phones for $700 each, so the total cost of the phones is 5 x $700 = $3500.

The seller gives the electronics seller $4000 in dollar bills. To find out how much change the seller will give back, we need to subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given.

Change = Amount given - Total cost of phones
Change = $4000 - $3500
Change = $500

The seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to determine how much Keenan spends in a month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

The total cost is $400 per month, and Madeline pays 60% of it. To find 60% of $400, we multiply 400 by 0.6. 

0.6 * 400 = 240

This means Madeline pays $240 per month, and Keenan pays the remaining 40% of $400, which is 0.4 * 400 = $160 per month.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we need to divide the monthly cost by 4 to find out how much Keenan spends per week.

$160 / 4 = $40

The final answer is: $40"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of pieces eaten by Tobias. 

First, let's find out how many pieces he ate on the first day. 2/5 of 60 is (2/5) * 60 = 24 pieces.

So, after the first day, he had eaten 24 pieces, leaving 60 - 24 = 36 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces, leaving 36 - 10 = 26 pieces.

Now, let's find out how many pieces he ate on the third day. 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces is (7/13) * 26 = 14 pieces.

So, the total number of pieces eaten by Tobias is 24 + 10 + 14 = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water. 

Let's start by finding the cost of one bottle of soda. Since 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00, we can divide the total cost by the number of bottles to find the cost of one bottle of soda.

Cost of one bottle of soda = Total cost of 7 bottles / Number of bottles
= $21.00 / 7
= $3.00

Now, let's find the cost of one bottle of water. Since 4 bottles of water cost $8.00, we can divide the total cost by the number of bottles to find the cost of one bottle of water.

Cost of one bottle of water = Total cost of 4 bottles / Number of bottles
= $8.00 / 4
= $2.00

Now that we know the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water, we can find the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water.

Total cost = (Cost of one bottle of soda * Number of bottles of soda) + (Cost of one bottle of water * Number of bottles of water)
= ($3.00 * 3) + ($2.00 * 2)
= $9.00 + $4.00
= $13.00

The cost of each bolt is $0.03, and David wants to buy 16 bolts. 

Total cost = Number of bolts * Cost per bolt
Total cost = 16 * $0.03
Total cost = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount of money David has:

Initial amount = $12.48
Total cost = $0.48
Amount left = Initial amount - Total cost
Amount left = $12.48 - $0.48
Amount left = $12.00

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations: first, Paul receives 28 marbles from his friend, then he loses 1/4 of his total marbles.

Initially, Paul has 52 marbles. After receiving 28 marbles, he has 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.

Now, we need to find 1/4 of 80. To do this, we multiply 80 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing 80 by 4. 

80 / 4 = 20

So, Paul lost 20 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has left, we subtract 20 from his total after receiving the marbles from his friend.

80 - 20 = 60

Therefore, Paul has 60 marbles left.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total points scored by Amy in each type of question and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the points scored in multiple-choice questions:
Amy correctly answers 80% of the 10 multiple-choice questions, so she answers 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions correctly.
Each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, so she scores 8 * 1 = 8 points from multiple-choice questions.

Next, let's calculate the points scored in true/false questions:
Amy correctly answers 90% of the 20 true/false questions, so she answers 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions correctly.
Each true/false question is worth 1 point, so she scores 18 * 1 = 18 points from true/false questions.

Now, let's calculate the points scored in long-answer questions:
Amy correctly answers 60% of the 5 long-answer questions, so she answers 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions correctly.
Each long-answer question is worth 5 points, so she scores 3 * 5 = 15 points from long-answer questions.

Finally, let's add the points scored in each type of question to get the total points scored by Amy:

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. Since he plans to sell 3/5 of his 300 chickens, we can calculate this as follows:

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Next, we know that Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000 by selling these chickens at $50 each. To find the total revenue, we multiply the number of chickens by the price per chicken:

180 chickens * $50/chicken = $9000

Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, we can assume that his total cost for the chickens is the revenue minus the profit:

Total cost = Total revenue - Profit
Total cost = $9000 - $2000
Total cost = $7000

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"
"To find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 2, since they sold an equal number. 

Total glasses sold = 32
Number of people who sold an equal number of glasses = 2 (Micah and Mitchell)
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = Total glasses sold / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16

Since Julie sold 14 glasses, we can find out how many more glasses she sold than Micah by subtracting the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold.

Glasses sold by Julie - Glasses sold by Micah = 14 - 16 = -2

However, since we cannot have a negative number of glasses, this means that Micah actually sold more glasses than Julie. The question asks for how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, but since Micah sold more, the answer will be negative.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, let's find out how much Iris spent on the manicure. Since she spent 1/4 as much on the manicure as she did on her hair, and she spent $400 on her hair, we can calculate the cost of the manicure as follows:

Manicure cost = 1/4 * Hair cost
Manicure cost = 1/4 * $400
Manicure cost = $100

Next, we need to find out how much she spent on the pedicure. Since she spent 3/4 as much on the pedicure as she did on the manicure, we can calculate the cost of the pedicure as follows:

Pedicure cost = 3/4 * Manicure cost
Pedicure cost = 3/4 * $100
Pedicure cost = $75

Now, we can find the total amount she spent at the spa by adding the costs of her hair, manicure, and pedicure:

Total cost = Hair cost + Manicure cost + Pedicure cost
Total cost = $400 + $100 + $75
Total cost = $575

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Sarah will receive from selling the rope and then subtract the cost of the new rope.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Sarah will receive from selling the rope:

Length of the rope = 20 meters
Price per meter = $2
Total amount of money = Length of the rope * Price per meter
Total amount of money = 20 * 2
Total amount of money = $40

Next, let's calculate the cost of the new rope:

Length of the new rope = 20 meters (assuming Sarah wants to buy a rope of the same length)
Price per meter of the new rope = $1.5
Cost of the new rope = Length of the new rope * Price per meter of the new rope
Cost of the new rope = 20 * 1.5
Cost of the new rope = $30

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope:

Amount of money left over = Total amount of money - Cost of the new rope
Amount of money left over = $40 - $30
Amount of money left over = $10

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine Melanie's current age. Since in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old, we can subtract 10 from 18 to find her current age.

Melanie's current age = 18 - 10 = 8 years old.

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let's denote the number of years as 'x'. In 'x' years, Melanie's age will be her current age plus 'x', which is 8 + x. According to the problem, this age will be thrice her current age, so we can set up the equation:

8 + x = 3 * 8

Simplifying the equation, we get:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart and then subtract that from her budget.

First, let's find the cost of the chicken. Since each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and the 5 packs of bacon cost $10, the cost of each pack of chicken is $10 / 5 = $2. Since Kelly has 6 packs of chicken, the total cost of the chicken is 6 * $2 = $12.

Next, let's find the cost of the strawberries. Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of the strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

Now, let's find the cost of the apples. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost of the apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart: $10 (bacon) + $12 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $48.

Finally, let's subtract the total cost of the items from Kelly's budget: $65 - $48 = $17.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Let's denote the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts as 'x' minutes. 

Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, its runtime is 2x minutes. 

At the end of the concert, she performs a 15-minute encore. So, the total runtime of the final concert is 2x + 15 minutes.

We are given that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 = 65

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50

Next, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x:

x = 50 / 2
x = 25

So, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many microphones were not arranged in pairs. Since 20% of the microphones couldn't fit, we can calculate the number of microphones that couldn't fit as 20% of 50.

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 microphones

Since the singer wants to arrange the microphones in pairs, we can assume that the remaining microphones (after removing the 10 that couldn't fit) are arranged in pairs. 

Number of microphones that could fit = Total number of microphones - Number of microphones that couldn't fit
= 50 - 10
= 40

Since the microphones are arranged in pairs, we can divide the number of microphones that could fit by 2 to find the number of pairs.

Number of pairs = Number of microphones that could fit / 2

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts. 

First, Jerry counts six birds nesting in the bushes. 

Next, he counts 2/3rd of that number of birds flying overhead. To find 2/3rd of 6, we multiply 6 by 2 and then divide by 3. 

6 * 2 = 12
12 / 3 = 4

So, 2/3rd of 6 is 4. Therefore, Jerry counts 4 birds flying overhead.

Then, he counts 3 groups of eight birds each feeding. To find the total number of birds feeding, we multiply the number of groups by the number of birds in each group.

3 * 8 = 24

Now, we add the number of birds nesting, flying overhead, and feeding to find the total number of birds.

6 (nesting) + 4 (flying) + 24 (feeding) = 34

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the speeds of the whirligig, the whatchamacallit, and the thingamabob. 

Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as 'x'. 

Given that a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, its speed can be expressed as 11x. 

We are also given that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. Therefore, we can set up the equation 11x = 121.

To find the speed of the thingamabob, we need to solve for x. 

Dividing both sides of the equation by 11, we get x = 121 / 11 = 11.

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig. Since the whirligig spins at five times the speed of the thingamabog, its speed is 5x = 5 * 11 = 55.

The total cost of the salad and the yogurt is 6 + 3 = 9 dollars.

Since Ellen pays a total of 11 dollars for her goods, the cost of the carrots can be found by subtracting the cost of the salad and the yogurt from the total cost: 11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

Since Ellen eats two carrots, the cost of one carrot is 2 / 2 = 1 dollar.

"To determine Mark's new weekly earnings, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark's original hourly wage was $10. The raise is $2 per hour, so his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12.

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

To find Mark's new weekly earnings, we multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

The final answer is: $480"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many times Tasha mowed each lawn. Let's denote the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of times she mowed lawns is the sum of the times she mowed each lawn: x + 3x + 5x = 9x.

We know that she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, and since she mowed lawns 9x times, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 9x * 6 = 54x.

We also know that she made a total of $80 from both lemonade sales and mowing lawns. Since she made 54x from mowing lawns, the amount she made from lemonade sales is 80 - 54x.

However, we don't know the value of x. We can use the fact that she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn to find the value of x. Since she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, and she mowed lawns 9x times, we can set up the equation 6 = 9x * 6 / 9x, which simplifies to 6 = 6. However, this is not correct, as it doesn't involve x.

"To find Harry's weight, we need to determine Christian's weight first, then subtract 5 kg from it.

Martin's weight is 55 kg. 
Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

"To determine John's profit, we need to calculate his total earnings from renting out his car and subtract his car payment.

First, let's calculate his total earnings from renting out his car. He rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so the total hours he rents his car per month is 10 * 3 = 30 hours.

Since he gets paid $25 an hour, his total earnings from renting out his car per month is 30 hours * $25/hour = $750.

Now, we subtract his car payment from his total earnings to find his profit. His profit is $750 - $500 = $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many notebooks Martha had initially. Since she bought 5 more notebooks to reach a total of 7, we can calculate her initial number of notebooks as follows:

Initial number of notebooks = Total number of notebooks - Number of notebooks bought
= 7 - 5
= 2

Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, we can calculate the number of notebooks Joseph had:

Number of notebooks Joseph had = 3 * Initial number of notebooks Martha had
= 3 * 2
= 6

Now, to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has:

Difference = Number of notebooks Martha has - Number of notebooks Joseph has
= 7 - 6
= 1

Therefore, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the distance Anis rowed. Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis' distance as follows:

Anis' distance = Dijana's distance + (1/5 * Dijana's distance)
Anis' distance = 50 + (1/5 * 50)
Anis' distance = 50 + 10
Anis' distance = 60

Now, we can find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis by adding their individual distances:

Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis' distance
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of cookies available for distribution after Susan's husband took some for himself. Initially, Susan had 100 cookies. Her husband took 4 cookies, so the remaining number of cookies is 100 - 4 = 96.

Since Susan wants to divide the cookies equally among her 6 nephews, we need to divide the remaining cookies by 6. 

96 ÷ 6 = 16

So, each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of pages Denise and Daniel read. 

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more than as many pages as Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 5 + 13 = 18 pages today.

To find the total number of pages each person read, we add the pages they read yesterday and today. Denise read 10 + 18 = 28 pages, and Daniel read 13 + 0 = 13 pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the number of pages Daniel read from the number of pages Denise read: 28 - 13 = 15.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of bowls that can be filled with the leftover soup and then divide that by the number of child-sized bowls.

Since the pot can fill four adult bowls or eight child bowls, we can assume that the capacity of the pot is equivalent to 8 child bowls. 

If Calvin, his wife, and their two children eat one bowl each for dinner, that's a total of 4 bowls. 

The leftover soup can fill 8 child bowls, and 4 bowls were used for dinner. So, there are 8 - 4 = 4 child bowls left.

Since there are two children, and there are 4 child bowls left, each child can have 4 / 2 = 2 bowls of soup for lunch.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the amount of material required for each type of mask and then calculate the total amount needed for the desired quantity.

For small masks, Jo needs 2 yards of material to make 4 masks. To find out how much material is needed for one small mask, we divide the total material by the number of masks: 2 yards / 4 masks = 0.5 yards per small mask.

For large masks, Jo needs 2.25 yards of material to make 3 masks. To find out how much material is needed for one large mask, we divide the total material by the number of masks: 2.25 yards / 3 masks = 0.75 yards per large mask.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of material required for 20 small and 8 large masks. 

For small masks: 20 masks * 0.5 yards/mask = 10 yards
For large masks: 8 masks * 0.75 yards/mask = 6 yards

The total amount of material needed is the sum of the material required for small and large masks: 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

"To determine Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total hours in a day and subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

A standard day has 24 hours. 

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night. 
He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours a day.
He walks his dog for 1 hour a day.

Total hours spent on these activities: 10 (sleep) + 8 (work) + 1 (walking dog) = 19 hours.

Free time = Total hours in a day - Total hours spent on activities
Free time = 24 - 19
Free time = 5 hours

Now, we know that Tim used 3 blue shoeboxes and 3 red shoeboxes for fishing. To find out how many shoeboxes are left, we subtract the number of shoeboxes used from the total number of shoeboxes:

Number of blue shoeboxes left = 7 - 3 = 4
Number of red shoeboxes left = 9 - 3 = 6

So, there are 4 blue shoeboxes and 6 red shoeboxes left in Tim's box.

The final answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of books Joseph initially had. Since Joseph had twice the number of Sarah's books, and Sarah has 9 books, we can calculate Joseph's initial number of books as follows:

Joseph's initial number of books = 2 * Sarah's number of books
= 2 * 9
= 18

However, Joseph lost 2 books, so we need to subtract those from his initial number of books to find out how many he currently has:

Joseph's current number of books = Joseph's initial number of books - 2

Now, we need to subtract the marbles given to Jamie and Donald from the total number of marbles Dean has:

Initial marbles = 30
Marbles given to Jamie = 6
Marbles given to Donald = 10
Total marbles given away = 6 + 10 = 16

Marbles left for Dean = Initial marbles - Total marbles given away

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write an equation:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 2 * Adam's age four years ago
Duncan's age eight years ago = 2x

We know that Duncan's current age is 60. To find his age eight years ago, we subtract 8 from his current age:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 60 - 8
Duncan's age eight years ago = 52

Now we can equate this to 2x:

52 = 2x

To find x, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 52 / 2
x = 26

This means Adam's age four years ago was 26. To find Adam's current age, we add 4 to x:

Adam's current age = x + 4
Adam's current age = 26 + 4
Adam's current age = 30

Finally, to find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = Adam's current age + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 38

"To find the total number of acres of Farmer Smith's farm, we first need to calculate it. Since Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm, we can express this as:

Farmer Smith's farm = 2 * Farmer Brown's farm + 100

Given that Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Farmer Smith's farm = 2 * 200 + 100
Farmer Smith's farm = 400 + 100
Farmer Smith's farm = 500

Now, to find the total number of acres of both farms together, we add the acres of Farmer Brown's farm to the acres of Farmer Smith's farm:

Total acres = Farmer Brown's farm + Farmer Smith's farm
Total acres = 200 + 500
Total acres = 700

The final answer is: 700"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of packages Colby completes in an hour. We know that he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so we can express this as an equation:

Packages per hour = 50 - 10
Packages per hour = 40

Next, we need to find out how many packages Colby completes in an 8-hour workday. We can multiply the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours he works:

Packages per day = Packages per hour * Hours worked
Packages per day = 40 * 8
Packages per day = 320

Now, we need to find out how much money Colby earns in a day. We know that he gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes, so we can multiply the number of packages he completes per day by the amount he gets paid per package:

Earnings per day = Packages per day * Pay per package
Earnings per day = 320 * 0.20
Earnings per day = 64

A normal sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long. So, an extreme sudoku takes 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to find out how many half-hour intervals fit into 180 minutes. There are 180 / 30 = 6 intervals of 30 minutes in 180 minutes.

Therefore, John drinks 6 bottles of water in the time it takes to complete an extreme sudoku puzzle.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons. Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and there were 20 red balloons, the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

We know that Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna at the bundle of balloons. Since 40 pieces were thrown at the red balloons, the remaining pieces must have been thrown at the yellow balloons. Therefore, the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is 58 - 40 = 18.

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons can be found by dividing the total number of pieces thrown at the yellow balloons by 3. Therefore, the number of yellow balloons is 18 / 3 = 6.

Since Jon drives 100 miles a day, the total miles driven in a 30-day month is 100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles.

Given that Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can divide the total miles driven by the interval between tune-ups to find the number of tune-ups needed.

3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups.

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in a 30-day month.

The final answer is: 3"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of hours Bruce works each day and then sum them up.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, which is 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours Bruce works each day: 5 (Tuesday) + 10 (Wednesday) + 8 (Thursday) = 23 hours.

The final answer is: 23"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total amount of money Julia and Nadine had. 

Let's break down the expenses:

1. The cake costs $11.
2. 1 dozen balloons is equal to 12 balloons. Since 2 balloons cost $0.5, we can find the cost of 1 balloon by dividing $0.5 by 2, which equals $0.25. Therefore, 12 balloons cost 12 * $0.25 = $3.
3. The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total cost of the items is $11 + $3 + $14 = $28. Since Julia and Nadine had the same amount of allowance, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Let x be the amount of allowance each girl received. The total amount of money they had is 2x. Since they spent $28, we can set up the equation:

2x = 28

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14.

The final answer is: $14"
"To determine the total number of fruits Kira bought, we need to add the number of apples, bananas, and oranges. 

3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14

Since Lola ate 2 pieces of the fruit, we need to subtract 2 from the total number of fruits Kira bought.

14 - 2 = 12

Therefore, there are 12 pieces of fruit left.

12"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of students participating in each sport and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of students playing tennis. There are 6 students playing tennis, and twice that number are playing volleyball. So, the number of students playing volleyball is 2 * 6 = 12.

Now, let's add the number of students playing tennis and volleyball: 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) = 18.

Next, we have 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer. To find the total number of students playing soccer, we add the number of boys and girls: 16 (boys) + 22 (girls) = 38.

Now, we add the total number of students playing tennis and volleyball to the total number of students playing soccer: 18 (tennis and volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56.

The final answer is: 56"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost, then find the profit.

First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class. Since each student sold 10 lollipops on average, and there are 30 students, the total number of lollipops sold is:

Total lollipops sold = 10 lollipops/student * 30 students = 300 lollipops

Next, let's calculate the total revenue. Each lollipop costs $0.8, so the total revenue is:

Total revenue = 300 lollipops * $0.8/lollipop = $240

Now, let's calculate the total cost. Each lollipop costs $0.5, so the total cost is:

Total cost = 300 lollipops * $0.5/lollipop = $150

Finally, let's calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $240 - $150 = $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

$90"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets Larry has: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

The final answer is: 47"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of slices each person can eat per day and then divide the total number of slices in the loaf by the combined daily consumption.

Abby can eat 2 slices per day. 
Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, so Josh can eat 2 * 2 = 4 slices per day.

The combined daily consumption is 2 (Abby) + 4 (Josh) = 6 slices per day.

The loaf of bread has 24 slices. To find out how many days it will last, we divide the total number of slices by the combined daily consumption: 24 / 6 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"This problem can be solved by using basic arithmetic. Martha collects one shell per month, and she has been collecting shells for 5 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, we can calculate the total number of months she has been collecting shells as follows:

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects one shell per month, we can multiply the total number of months by 1 to find the total number of shells she has collected:

60 months * 1 shell/month = 60 shells

Therefore, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected 60 shells.

60"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, let's find out how many cups of tea Lana has in total after dividing the 27 cups into 3 rows with equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea. Since there are 3 rows, and each row has an equal number of cups, we can divide 27 by 3 to get the number of cups in each row. 

27 / 3 = 9 cups in each row.

Since each row has equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea, the total number of cups in each row is divided equally between the two types of tea. Therefore, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is half of the total cups in each row.

9 / 2 = 4.5 cups of mint tea in each row.

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a cup, we can assume that Lana has 4 cups of mint tea in each row and 5 cups of chamomile tea in each row, as the total number of cups in each row is 9.

Now, let's find out how many cups of tea Lana has in total after brewing the 15 cups of cinnamon tea. We already know that she has 27 cups initially. After brewing 15 cups of cinnamon tea, she will have 27 - 15 = 12 cups left.

Since we know that Lana has 3 rows with 9 cups in each row, and she has 12 cups left, we can assume that the 12 cups are the remaining chamomile tea cups. This is because the mint tea cups are already accounted for in the 3 rows.

Now, we can find the number of cups of mint tea in each row by dividing the total number of cups in each row by 2.

4.5 cups of mint tea in each row.

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a cup, we can assume that Lana has 4 cups of mint tea in each row and 5 cups of chamomile tea in each row.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip. 

Let's break down the information given:

- The sloth takes 4 hours to make a round trip (down and back up) to collect berries.
- The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

Since the sloth takes 4 hours for a round trip, in 8 hours, he can make 8 / 4 = 2 round trips.

If he makes 2 round trips, and he wants to collect 24 berries, we can divide 24 by 2 to find the minimum number of berries he can pick up per trip.

24 / 2 = 12

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial amount of water in the tank and then calculate the remaining water after 6 days.

First, Anthony and his father fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool. Since there are 10,000 gallons of water in the pool, half of that is 5,000 gallons.

The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. To find the remaining water after 6 days, we need to subtract the total amount of water emptied from the initial amount in the tank.

Total water emptied in 6 days = 500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3,000 gallons

Remaining water in the tank after 6 days = Initial water in the tank - Total water emptied
= 5,000 gallons - 3,000 gallons
= 2,000 gallons

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the remaining budget Colby has for the last day of the month. 

Colby's initial budget is $150. He has already spent money on:

- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total spent so far: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Remaining budget: $150 - $130 = $20

Since Colby wants to buy a popcorn and a box of candy, he will spend $8 + $2 = $10 on these items.

Remaining budget after buying popcorn and candy: $20 - $10 = $10

Now, we need to find out how many movies he can see with the remaining budget. 

Tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10, and he has $10 left. He can see 1 movie on a Friday or Saturday.

Tickets for other days cost $7, but he has only $10 left, which is not enough to buy a ticket for any other day.

Therefore, Colby can see 1 more movie.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked, we first need to calculate the calories of each type of mini pastry. 

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 * (1/3) = 200 calories. 

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 * (1/3) = 150 calories.

Now, we can calculate the total calories of each type of pastry. The total calories of the mini cinnamon rolls are 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories. The total calories of the mini blueberry muffins are 150 * 300 = 45,000 calories.

The total calories of all the pastries are the sum of the calories of the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins, which is 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed and then divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, so 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Tuesday, so 2 * 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

The total number of Junebugs removed is 39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378.

There are 5 days in total. 

The average number of Junebugs removed per day is 378 / 5 = 75.6."
"To determine how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled and then find the difference between the two distances.

The distance traveled by the bus can be calculated by multiplying its speed (60 miles per hour) by the time it traveled (5 hours): 60 miles/hour * 5 hours = 300 miles.

The distance traveled by the car can be calculated by multiplying its speed (30 miles per hour) by the time it traveled (8 hours): 30 miles/hour * 8 hours = 240 miles.

To find the difference in distance, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus: 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles.

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of toys Sophie had before buying the tube of bouncy balls and then subtract that from the total number of toys she has now.

Initially, Sophie had the bag of building blocks (31 blocks), the bin of stuffed animals (8 stuffed animals), and the tower of stacking rings (9 rings). 

Total number of toys before buying the bouncy balls = 31 + 8 + 9 = 48

Now, we know that after buying the tube of bouncy balls, Sophie has a total of 62 toys. 

To find the number of bouncy balls, we subtract the initial number of toys from the total number of toys now: 

Number of bouncy balls = Total number of toys now - Total number of toys before buying bouncy balls
= 62 - 48

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the ages of Peter, Paul, and John. 

Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as p, and John's age as j. We are given the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old. However, there is no information about Jean's age, so we will ignore this statement for now.
2. Paul is 10 years older than John, so p = j + 10.
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, so P = p + j.

From statement 2, we can express p in terms of j: p = j + 10.

Substituting p = j + 10 into statement 3, we get P = (j + 10) + j, which simplifies to P = 2j + 10.

Now, we need to find the value of j. Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to determine the value of j directly. However, we can use the fact that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old. Since we don't have information about Jean's age, we will assume that the statement is incorrect or irrelevant to the problem.

We will ignore the statement about the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean. We will use the relationship between Peter's, Paul's, and John's ages to find the value of j.

We have two equations:

1. p = j + 10
2. P = 2j + 10

We can substitute p = j + 10 into the second equation: P = 2(j + 10) + 10, which simplifies to P = 2j + 20 + 10, which further simplifies to P = 2j + 30.

Now we have two equations:

1. P = 2j + 30
2. p = j + 10

We can substitute p = j + 10 into the first equation: P = 2(j + 10) + 30, which simplifies to P = 2j + 20 + 30, which further simplifies to P = 2j + 50.

Now we have two equations:

1. P = 2j + 50
2. p = j + 10

We can equate the two expressions for P: 2j + 50 = 2j + 30 + 20, which simplifies to 2j + 50 = 2j + 50.

This equation is true for any value of j, so we cannot determine the value of j. However, we can express P in terms of j: P = 2j + 50.

Unfortunately, we cannot find a unique solution for the age of Peter."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of water balloons each person has and then sum them up.

Initially, Maria and her 4 friends each have 2 water balloons. So, the total number of water balloons they have is 5 * 2 = 10.

Then, Maria's mom gives each person 3 more balloons. So, each person now has 2 + 3 = 5 water balloons. Since there are 5 people (including Maria), the total number of water balloons they have is 5 * 5 = 25.

Therefore, the total number of water balloons the girls have is 25."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of boxes of stuff the charity group has and then determine how many tables they need to display them.

First, let's calculate the total number of boxes of stuff donated by the 10 people:

10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes

Adding the 10 boxes they already own, the total number of boxes is:

50 boxes (donated) + 10 boxes (already owned) = 60 boxes

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we need to divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find out how many tables they need:

60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

However, they already own 15 tables. To find out how many new tables they need, we subtract the number of tables they already own from the total number of tables needed:

30 tables (required) - 15 tables (already owned) = 15 tables

Therefore, the charity group needs 15 new tables.

15"
"To find the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance spat by each person and then divide it by the total number of seeds spat.

Zoey spits 40 seeds, each 10 feet, so the total distance spat by Zoey is 40 * 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney spits 35 seeds, each 12 feet, so the total distance spat by Sydney is 35 * 12 = 420 feet.

The total distance spat by both is 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

The total number of seeds spat is 40 + 35 = 75.

The average total distance spat is 820 / 75 = 10.93 (rounded to two decimal places).

WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Next, let's calculate the revenue generated by each machine in a month:

Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

Now, let's find the difference in revenue:

$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

The Widgeteer 3000 will generate $64,800 more in revenue than the WidgetMaster 9000 in a month.

"To determine how much money Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his chosen option and compare it to the cost of the 24-hour stay.

Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. Since the 12-hour stay is already included in the 24-hour stay, Cameron will only pay for the additional 5 hours. 

The cost of the additional 5 hours is 5 * 70 pesos = 350 pesos.

The cost of the 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos. 

The cost of Cameron's chosen option is 1000 pesos (for the initial 12 hours) + 350 pesos (for the additional 5 hours) = 1350 pesos.

To find out how much money Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of his chosen option from the cost of the 24-hour stay: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately, and then add them together.

First, let's find out how much hay each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Each goat needs 5 pounds, so twice that amount is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds. Three pounds less than that is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep:

For the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds
For the sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

Now, we add the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs:

75 pounds (goats) + 84 pounds (sheep) = 159 pounds

2. Calculate John's expenses:
   John spends 50 dollars on gas and buys 5 pencils at 10 dollars each, so the total cost of pencils is 5 * 10 = 50 dollars. His total expenses are 50 (gas) + 50 (pencils) = 100 dollars.

3. Calculate John's remaining money:
   John's remaining money is his total earnings minus his total expenses: 300 - 100 = 200 dollars.

"To determine the total amount Patty charged, we need to calculate the labor cost and add it to the cost of parts. 

The labor cost is $35 per hour, and the job took 2.25 hours. Since the labor is charged per hour or part thereof, we need to round up to the nearest hour for the labor cost. However, in this case, 2.25 hours is less than 3 hours, so we can simply multiply 2.25 hours by $35 per hour.

Labor cost = 2.25 hours * $35 per hour = $78.75

The cost of parts is $60.

Total cost = Labor cost + Cost of parts
Total cost = $78.75 + $60
Total cost = $138.75

Therefore, Patty charged $138.75 for the job.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the CDs, the amount James paid after the discount, and then subtract the amount he received from selling the CDs he didn't like.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs: 10 CDs * $15 per CD = $150.

Since James gets a 40% discount, we need to calculate the discount amount: 40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $150 - $60 = $90.

James decides to sell 5 CDs for $40 each, so the total amount he received is: 5 CDs * $40 per CD = $200.

However, since James bought the CDs for $90, we need to subtract the amount he received from the cost to find out how much money he was out: $90 - $200 = -$110.

However, since you can't be out a negative amount of money, this means James actually made a profit of $110."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's calculate the time James takes to swim 60% of the distance. The total distance is 20 miles, and 60% of that is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

Next, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, let's calculate the remaining distance. The total distance is 20 miles, and James has already swum 12 miles, so the remaining distance is 20 - 12 = 8 miles. James swims at half the speed of 2 miles per hour, which is 1 mile per hour. The time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

The total time taken is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time taken to swim the remaining distance: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the commission earned from the sales of the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the commission from the New York Times:

- The price of each copy of the New York Times is $5.
- The commission on each copy is 10%.
- The number of copies sold is 6.
- Commission = (price * commission rate * number of copies) = (5 * 0.10 * 6) = $3 per copy.
- Total commission from New York Times = $3 * 6 = $18.

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal:

- The price of each copy of the Wall Street Journal is $15.
- The commission on each copy is 8%.
- The number of copies sold is 10.
- Commission = (price * commission rate * number of copies) = (15 * 0.08 * 10) = $12 per copy.
- Total commission from Wall Street Journal = $12 * 10 = $120.

Now, let's add the total commission from both newspapers:

Total commission = $18 + $120 = $138.

The final answer is: $138"
"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that Deanna is 26 years old. We are also given that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so Marcus's age can be calculated as follows:

Marcus's age = Deanna's age - 5
Marcus's age = 26 - 5
Marcus's age = 21

We are also given that Marcus is half of Leo's age. Let's represent Leo's age as 'L'. We can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

Marcus's age = L / 2
21 = L / 2

To find Leo's age, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

L = 21 * 2
L = 42

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old.

The final answer is: 42"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up equations based on the given information. Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as A, Bahati as B, and Dinar as D.

We know that the total points scored by the team is 45, so we can write the equation:

A + B + D = 45

We also know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so we can write:

B = A + 20

We also know that Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so we can write:

B = D + 10

Since we have two equations with B, we can substitute one of them into the first equation to solve for A. Let's substitute B = A + 20 into the first equation:

A + (A + 20) + D = 45

Combine like terms:

2A + D + 20 = 45

Subtract 20 from both sides:

2A + D = 25

Now, we can substitute B = D + 10 into the equation B = A + 20:

D + 10 = A + 20

Subtract 10 from both sides:

D = A + 10

Now we have two equations with D:

2A + D = 25
D = A + 10

Substitute D = A + 10 into the first equation:

2A + (A + 10) = 25

Combine like terms:

3A + 10 = 25

Subtract 10 from both sides:

3A = 15

Divide both sides by 3:

A = 5

Therefore, Azibo scored 5 points.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand that each paper is used for two pages, and the book is 1.5 inches thick. Since there are 100 pages to the inch, we can calculate the total number of pages by multiplying the thickness of the book by the number of pages per inch.

First, we need to find out how many sets of 100 pages are in 1.5 inches. 

1.5 inches * 100 pages/inch = 150 pages

However, since each paper is used for two pages, we need to divide the total number of pages by 2 to get the actual number of pages in the book.

150 pages / 2 = 75 pages

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of minutes Vince stapled reports. 

First, we find the total minutes from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM. There are 15 hours from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 15 hours by 60 minutes per hour to get the total minutes: 15 * 60 = 900 minutes.

Next, we need to find out how many sets of 15 minutes are in 900 minutes. We divide 900 minutes by 15 minutes to get the number of sets: 900 / 15 = 60 sets.

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we multiply the number of sets by the number of reports stapled per set: 60 sets * 30 reports/set = 1800 reports.

The final answer is: 1800"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Kim spent sleeping and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim's usual sleep schedule is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she usually sleeps for 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, that day she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.

The time she went to sleep is still 10 p.m., but we need to find the time she actually went to sleep that day. Since she was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m., she must have gone to sleep before 2:15 a.m. 

To find the time she went to sleep, we can subtract the sleepwalking time from the time she woke up. 2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes. Since she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, she must have gone to sleep 5 minutes earlier than usual. So, the time she went to sleep is 10 p.m. - 5 minutes = 9:55 p.m.

Now, we can calculate the total time she slept that day. The time she went to sleep is 9:55 p.m. and the time she woke up is 5:55 a.m. 

To find the total time she slept, we need to convert the times to minutes. 9:55 p.m. is 9 * 60 + 55 = 595 minutes. 5:55 a.m. is 5 * 60 + 55 = 355 minutes.

The total time she slept is 355 - 595 = -240 minutes. However, this is incorrect because it's not possible to sleep a negative amount of time. 

Let's recalculate the time she went to sleep. Since she was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m., she must have gone to sleep before 2:15 a.m. We know that she usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. 

The time she was sleepwalking is 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. This is 23 minutes. Since she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, she must have gone to sleep 5 minutes earlier than usual. 

However, we can also calculate the time she went to sleep by finding the time she would have gone to sleep if she had not been sleepwalking. Since she usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m., she sleeps for 8 hours. 

The time she was sleepwalking is 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. This is 23 minutes. Since she usually sleeps for 8 hours, she would have gone to sleep at 10 p.m. + 8 hours = 6 a.m. However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she would have gone to sleep at 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

Two dozen cups is equal to 2 x 12 = 24 cups.

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

Number of measuring spoons = (2/3) x 24
= (2/3) x 24
= 16

Now, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so we need to subtract 6 from the initial number of measuring spoons to find the remaining number of measuring spoons:

Remaining measuring spoons = 16 - 6
= 10

Since the question asks for the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we need to add the remaining measuring spoons to the number of measuring cups:

Total number of utensils = 24 (measuring cups) + 10 (measuring spoons)
= 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the number of occupied beds and then subtract that from the total capacity of the hospital.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied. 

1/5 of 1000 is 100, so there are 100 occupied beds initially.

Each day, 50 patients are admitted. Since there are 7 days in a week, in 2 weeks, there will be 14 days.

In 14 days, 50 patients are admitted each day, so the total number of patients admitted in 14 days is 50 * 14 = 700.

Initially, there were 100 occupied beds, and 700 more patients were admitted in 14 days. So, the total number of occupied beds after 14 days is 100 + 700 = 800.

The total capacity of the hospital is 1000 beds, and 800 beds are occupied. Therefore, the number of unoccupied beds is 1000 - 800 = 200.

Two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to her family. Two-thirds of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6. This means she sends 6 emails to her family.

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after sending to her family. Since she sends 6 emails to her family, the remaining emails are 9 - 6 = 3.

One-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend. One-third of 3 is (1/3) * 3 = 1.

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from the number she reported.

Let's denote the number of people Courtney reported as x. Since Kelly said Courtney overstated the number by 20%, we can express this as an equation:

x = actual number of people + 20% of the actual number of people

We know that Courtney reported 48 people, so we can set up the equation as follows:

48 = actual number of people + 0.20 * actual number of people

Combine like terms:

48 = 1.20 * actual number of people

Now, divide both sides by 1.20 to solve for the actual number of people:

actual number of people = 48 / 1.20
actual number of people = 40

The final answer is: 40"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations. Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as x. Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jason carried 2x balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried 2 * 2x = 4x balls.

We know that the total number of balls carried by the three boys is equal to the sum of the balls carried by each of them. Since they carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls is equal to the sum of the balls carried by each of them. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 4x = total number of balls

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so we can substitute 2 for 2x in the equation:

x + 2 + 4x = total number of balls

Combine like terms:

5x + 2 = total number of balls

Since Jason carried 2 balls, we can substitute 2 for 2x in the equation. We know that Jason carried 2 balls, so we can substitute 2 for 2x in the equation. We can also substitute 2 for 2x in the equation x + 2x + 4x = total number of balls. This gives us x + 2 + 4x = total number of balls. We can simplify this equation to 5x + 2 = total number of balls.

Now we need to find the value of x. We know that Jason carried 2 balls, which is equal to 2x. So, we can set up the equation 2x = 2 and solve for x. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 1.

Now that we know x = 1, we can substitute this value into the equation 5x + 2 = total number of balls. This gives us 5(1) + 2 = total number of balls. Simplifying this equation, we get 5 + 2 = total number of balls, which equals 7.

However, this is the number of balls carried by Jason, Jeffrey, and Jordan. We need to find the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice. Since the three boys carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls is equal to the sum of the balls carried by each of them. Therefore, the total number of balls is 7 + x + 2x + 4x. We already know that x = 1, so we can substitute this value into the equation. This gives us 7 + 1 + 2(1) + 4(1) = total number of balls. Simplifying this equation, we get 7 + 1 + 2 + 4 = total number of balls, which equals 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of holes dug on the first day as H1 = 10, on the second day as H2 = 13, and on the third day as H3 = 8. 

The total number of holes at the end of the third day is the sum of the holes dug on the first three days minus the two holes filled in: H_total_3 = H1 + H2 + H3 - 2 = 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29.

The problem states that the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. This means the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * H1 = 4 * 10 = 40.

Since the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 29, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is the difference between the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day and the total number of holes at the end of the third day: H4 = 40 - 29 = 11.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of corn chips that Amora and Lainey got as 'x'. Since Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others, Collins got x + 15 corn chips.

We are given that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, so we can set up the equation: x = 70.

Since Collins got x + 15 corn chips, and we know x = 70, Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, we need to find the total number of corn chips. The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips that Amora, Lainey, and Collins got: x + x + (x + 15) = 2x + (x + 15).

Substituting x = 70 into the equation, we get: 2(70) + (70 + 15) = 140 + 85 = 225.

The final answer is: 225"

50% of $400 is calculated as 0.5 * $400 = $200.

Now, we add this to the cost of the supplies: $400 + $200 = $600.

Therefore, the cost of the travel tickets is $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the number of Pokémon each person has caught. Let's say Adelwolfe has caught x Pokémon. Since Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe, Stan has caught 4x - 13 Pokémon. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so Alex has caught (4x - 13) + 5 = 4x - 8 Pokémon.

We know that the total number of Pokémon caught is 339, so we can set up the equation:

x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 8) = 339

Combine like terms:

9x - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:

9x = 360

Divide by 9:

x = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokémon, we can find out how many Stan has caught:

Stan has caught 4x - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 Pokémon.

The final answer is: 147"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of episodes in the show. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, we can set up an equation.

Let's denote the number of episodes as 'e'. Since there are half as many episodes as minutes per episode, we can write the equation as:

e = 20 / 2
e = 10

So, there are 10 episodes in the show.

Now, to find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

Total time = Number of episodes * Length of each episode
Total time = 10 * 20
Total time = 200 minutes

The final answer is: 200"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and calculate the distance traveled in each segment of the bird's journey.

1. The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour. To find the distance traveled in this segment, we multiply the speed by the time: 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles.

2. Then, the bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour. To find the distance traveled in this segment, we multiply the speed by the time: 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles.

3. Since the bird is flying north, this distance is subtracted from the initial distance traveled south. So, the net distance traveled south after this segment is 300 miles - 36 miles = 264 miles.

4. Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour. To find the distance traveled in this segment, we multiply the speed by the time: 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles.

5. To find the total distance traveled south, we add the net distance traveled after the second segment to the distance traveled in the third segment: 264 miles + 110 miles = 374 miles.

The distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles.

374"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of brownies Greta had throughout the day and then subtract the number of brownies eaten.

Greta initially made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, she had 12 brownies.

At her office, they sent her home with 1/2 a dozen brownies. Since 1/2 a dozen is equal to 6, she now has 12 + 6 = 18 brownies.

When she arrived home, her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting. Since 4 dozen is equal to 48, she now has 18 + 48 = 66 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. Since 1 1/2 dozen is equal to 18, she now has 66 - 18 = 48 brownies left.

The final answer is: 48"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the age of Nani's brother and sister first. 

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means her age is 75% of Nani's age. To find 75% of Nani's age, we multiply his age by 0.75. So, 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we have the ages of all three family members: Nani (8 years), his brother (16 years), and his sister (6 years). 

To find the total age of all three family members, we add their ages together: 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

The final answer is: 30"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it takes to string each type of racquet and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to string the synthetic gut racquets: 3 racquets * 15 minutes per racquet = 45 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to string the polyester racquets: 5 racquets * 22 minutes per racquet = 110 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to string the hybrid racquets. Since each hybrid racquet requires 2 types of strings, we need to calculate the time for each type and add them together: 4 racquets * 15 minutes (synthetic gut) + 4 racquets * 22 minutes (polyester) = 60 minutes + 88 minutes = 148 minutes. However, since the hybrid racquets are being strung with half synthetic gut and half polyester, we should divide the total time by 2 to avoid double-counting: 148 minutes / 2 = 74 minutes.

Now, let's add the time for each type of racquet together: 45 minutes (synthetic gut) + 110 minutes (polyester) + 74 minutes (hybrid) = 229 minutes.

The final answer is: 229"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the phones. The first two phones cost the full price of $600 each, so the total cost for the first two phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.

The remaining two phones are half price, which is $600 / 2 = $300 each. The total cost for the remaining two phones is 2 * $300 = $600.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining two phones: $1200 + $600 = $1800.

The final answer is: $1800"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of players on Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team by adding 7 to 13.

13 (Carlton's players) + 7 = 20

Now that we know Zeke's team has 20 players, we can find the total number of players in both teams by adding the number of players on each team.

20 (Zeke's players) + 13 (Carlton's players) = 33

The final answer is: 33"
"To determine the total number of wooden slats needed, we must first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2l + 2w, where l is the length and w is the width.

Given that the length (l) is 15 feet and the width (w) is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

P = 2(15) + 2(10)
P = 30 + 20
P = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2 to find the total number of slats needed:

Total slats = P * 2
Total slats = 50 * 2
Total slats = 100

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats for his fence.

The final answer is: 100"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges. So, the total number of oranges she bought is 12 * 20 = 240.

2. She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each, which is a total of 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges given away is 4 * 20 = 80.

3. Now, we need to find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington kept for herself. She kept 1/4 of the total oranges she bought. 1/4 of 240 is (1/4) * 240 = 60.

4. To find out how many oranges she sold, we need to subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges she bought. So, the number of oranges she sold is 240 - 60 = 180.

Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 180 oranges.

180"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of states in the USA and India. The USA has 50 states. 

Next, we need to find half the number of states in the USA. Half of 50 is 25. 

India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, so it has 25 + 4 = 29 states.

To find the total number of states in both countries together, we add the number of states in the USA and India: 50 + 29 = 79.

The final answer is: 79"
"To determine the number of hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books he wants to buy. 

The total cost of the books is the sum of the cost of the dictionary, the dinosaur book, and the children's cookbook: 
$18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, he still needs to earn the remaining amount to afford the books. 

The remaining amount he needs to earn is the total cost of the books minus the amount he has saved: 
$39 (total cost) - $14 (saved) = $25.

Tyler earns $5 per hour, so to find out how many hours he needs to work to earn the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: 
$25 (remaining amount) / $5 (hourly wage) = 5 hours.

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries, we can set up an equation to find Richard's share:

Robert's cherries = Richard's cherries + 10
30 = Richard's cherries + 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find Jerry's share. Since the total number of cherries is 60, and we know Robert and Richard's shares, we can subtract their shares from the total to find Jerry's share:

Jerry's cherries = Total cherries - (Robert's cherries + Richard's cherries)
Jerry's cherries = 60 - (30 + 20)
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 50
Jerry's cherries = 10

Now that we know Jerry has 10 cherries, we can find the difference between Robert's and Jerry's shares:

Difference = Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries
Difference = 30 - 10
Difference = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on both Saturday and Sunday, and then calculate the total earnings.

Let's denote the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday as G and the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday as A.

We know that on Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread, so G = 10.

We also know that on Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, and on Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. Therefore, A = 15 - 4 = 11.

On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday is G + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for each day:

On Saturday, the total earnings from gingerbread is 10 * $6 = $60, and the total earnings from apple pie is 11 * $15 = $165. The total earnings for Saturday is $60 + $165 = $225.

On Sunday, the total earnings from gingerbread is 15 * $6 = $90, and the total earnings from apple pie is 15 * $15 = $225. The total earnings for Sunday is $90 + $225 = $315.

The total earnings for two days is $225 + $315 = $540.

The final answer is: $540"
"To determine the number of bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we must first calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use. 

Since Pamela reapplies sunscreen every hour and she will be outside for 4 hours a day, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day. Over 8 days, she will reapply sunscreen 4 * 8 = 32 times.

Each application requires 1 ounce of sunscreen, so the total amount of sunscreen she will use is 32 ounces.

Since each bottle of sunscreen contains 8 ounces, we can calculate the number of bottles she will need by dividing the total amount of sunscreen she will use by the amount in each bottle: 32 / 8 = 4.

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the price of the red car, which is 40% cheaper than the blue car. 

Let's denote the price of the blue car as B and the price of the red car as R. We are given that B = $100.

Since the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, we can express this as R = B - 0.4B.

Substituting the value of B, we get R = 100 - 0.4(100) = 100 - 40 = $60.

Now, we know the price of the red car is $60 and the price of the blue car is $100.

The final answer is: 
Red car: $60
Blue car: $100"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Emil is 19 years old now.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

From point 3, we can infer that Emil's brother is currently half of Emil's age when Emil turns 24. Since Emil is 19 now, when he turns 24, he will be 24 - 19 = 5 years older. Therefore, his brother's age when Emil turns 24 will be 5 / 2 = 2.5 years.

Now, let's find the brother's current age. Since the brother will be 2.5 years old when Emil turns 24, the brother is currently 2.5 - 5 = -2.5 years old. However, this is not possible, as age cannot be negative. This indicates that the initial assumption is incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the information. If Emil is 19 now and will be half the age of his dad when he turns 24, his dad's age when Emil turns 24 will be 24 * 2 = 48 years.

Now, let's find the brother's age when Emil turns 24. Since Emil will be twice as old as his brother when he turns 24, the brother's age when Emil turns 24 will be 24 / 2 = 12 years.

The brother's current age is 12 - 5 = 7 years.

Now, let's find the dad's current age. Since the dad will be 48 years old when Emil turns 24, the dad's current age is 48 - 5 = 43 years.

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother is 43 + 7 = 50.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of beads Adrianne received from each person and then add them together.

Adrianne's mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of crawfish Joe caught on each day and then convert it into servings.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can calculate the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by the serving size: 21 / 3 = 7.

"To find the number of students leaving early, we first need to determine the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members.

First, let's find the number of football players. 20% of 30 students are football players. 

20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6

So, there are 6 football players.

Next, we need to find the number of students who are not football players. 

Total students - football players = 30 - 6 = 24

Now, 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band.

25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6

So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members.

The total number of students leaving early is the sum of football players and cheerleaders/band members.

6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders/band members) = 12

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first determine the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie's boots are size five, we can calculate Charlie's boot size as follows:

Charlie's boot size = 5 * Sophie's boot size
Charlie's boot size = 5 * 5
Charlie's boot size = 25

Now, to find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we add their sizes and divide by 2:

Average size = (Sophie's size + Charlie's size) / 2
Average size = (5 + 25) / 2
Average size = 30 / 2
Average size = 15

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of plants Pat needs to buy and then calculate the total cost.

First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches, since the width of the flowers is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (18 inches) between every plant, we need to subtract the width of the flowers and the space between them from the total length of the flower bed:

1332 inches - (12 inches/flower + 18 inches) = 1332 - (12 + 18) = 1302 inches

Now, we need to divide the remaining space by the width of a single flower to find out how many flowers can fit in the bed:

1302 inches / 12 inches/flower = 108.5 flowers

Since we can't have a fraction of a flower, we'll round down to 108 flowers. Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:

108 - 17 = 91 flowers

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be:

91 flowers * $6/flower = $546

The final answer is: $546"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. Since Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day and his brother eats 1/2 as many, we can calculate this as follows:

18 pretzels/day (Edgar) * 1/2 = 9 pretzels/day (Edgar's brother)

Now, we need to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the number of pretzels he eats in a day by 7:

9 pretzels/day * 7 days/week = 63 pretzels/week

Therefore, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total cost of petunias: 
5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket = 15 petunias
15 petunias * $3.00 per petunia = $45.00

Next, let's calculate the total cost of sweet potato vines:
5 baskets * 2 sweet potato vines per basket = 10 sweet potato vines
10 sweet potato vines * $2.50 per sweet potato vine = $25.00

Now, let's add the total cost of petunias and sweet potato vines together:
$45.00 (petunias) + $25.00 (sweet potato vines) = $70.00

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations, and then subtract that from the total amount of soil available to find out how much soil is left for the roses.

First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers: 
4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds

Next, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the carnations: 
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations: 
12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

The total amount of soil available is 30 pounds. To find out how much soil is left for the roses, we subtract the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total amount of soil: 
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, we can plant 3 roses with the remaining soil.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much Jessica saves each month and then determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with that amount in a year.

First, let's calculate Jessica's monthly savings: 25% of $2,000.00 is 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can multiply her monthly savings by 12 to find her yearly savings: $500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00.

Now, we need to divide her yearly savings by the cost of each pair of shoes to find out how many pairs she can buy: $6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6.

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two separate tasks: peeling and cooking. 

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, we can divide the total number of shrimp by her peeling rate:

90 shrimp / 6 shrimp per minute = 15 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to cook 90 shrimp. Since she can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can divide the total number of shrimp by her cooking rate:

90 shrimp / 30 shrimp per 10 minutes = 3 sets of 30 shrimp

Since each set takes 10 minutes, we multiply the number of sets by the cooking time:

3 sets * 10 minutes per set = 30 minutes

However, we need to consider that peeling and cooking are not simultaneous tasks. We need to add the time it takes for peeling to the time it takes for cooking. 

15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (cooking) = 45 minutes

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in temperature after the air conditioner has been running and turned off.

First, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner is running on low for 3 hours:

Temperature change on low = -2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = -6 degrees

Next, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner is running on high for 4 hours:

Temperature change on high = -3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = -12 degrees

Now, let's calculate the total temperature change when the air conditioner is running:

Total temperature change while running = -6 degrees + (-12 degrees) = -18 degrees

The air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, and during this time, the room warmed up at 2 degrees/hour:

Temperature change while off = 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees

Now, let's calculate the net temperature change:

Net temperature change = Total temperature change while running + Temperature change while off
= -18 degrees + 4 degrees
= -14 degrees

Since the net temperature change is -14 degrees, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as 'x'. Since Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, and Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, we can set up an equation.

When Bill saw the comet for the second time, his age was 3 * 30 = 90 years.

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, the time elapsed between the two sightings is 75 years. Therefore, the difference in Bill's age between the two sightings is 75 years.

We can set up the equation: x + 75 = 90, where x is Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time.

Solving for x, we get x = 90 - 75 = 15.

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each category and then add them together.

1. Checks for the electric bill: Since Buford writes a check once per month, and there are 12 months in a year, he writes 12 checks for the electric bill per year.
2. Checks for the gas bill: Similarly, Buford writes a check once per month for the gas bill, so he also writes 12 checks for the gas bill per year.
3. Checks to the church: Buford writes a check twice per month to the church, so in a year, he writes 2 * 12 = 24 checks to the church.
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: Buford writes a check quarterly, which means 4 times a year. So, he writes 4 checks to the pest and lawn service per year.

Now, let's add up the total number of checks:

12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn service) = 52

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as 'x'. Since the second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes, the first plane makes 2 * 44 = 88 trips.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, which is (3/4) * 88 = 66 flights. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France and Germany is (1/2) * (88 - 66) = 11.

Since the flights to France and Germany are equal, the number of flights to France is 11.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the individual howling times of each wolf and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of money Adam's father gave him. Since his father gave him twice as much as his mother, and his mother gave him $6, his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

Now, we know that Adam spent $30 on the trousers and received a total of $6 from his mother and $12 from his father, which is $6 + $12 = $18. To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount he received from his mother and father from the total cost of the trousers.

So, Adam's contribution from his savings is $30 - $18 = $12.

"To solve this problem, we can start by representing the ages of the children as variables. Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W. Since Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, we can express her age as 2A, where A is the average age of the group.

We know that the total age of the children is 20, and we also know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro. So, we can set up the following equation:

A + A + 2A + W = 20

Combine like terms:

4A + W = 20

We also know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, so we can express her age as 2A. Since we know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro, we can set up another equation:

A + 3 + 4 + 2A = 20

Combine like terms:

3A + 7 = 20

Subtract 7 from both sides:

3A = 13

Divide both sides by 3:

A = 13/3

Now that we have the average age, we can substitute it into the first equation:

4(13/3) + W = 20

Multiply 4 by 13/3:

52/3 + W = 20

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

52 + 3W = 60

Subtract 52 from both sides:

3W = 8

Divide both sides by 3:

W = 8/3

The age of Wilfred is 8/3 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.67}$"
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund before his friend donates $200. 

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. The total amount collected is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's friend donates $200, making the total amount collected $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Walter's lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Since everyone else (Walter's neighbors and the online fund) has donated $2200, Walter's lawyer will donate 3 * $2200 = $6600.

The final answer is: $6600"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of cookies brought to the reception. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is 1/2 * 1500 = 750.

Since each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received. 

Number of people in the church = Total cookies given to the church / Cookies per person
= 750 / 15
= 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, let's consider the total number of slices as 6 (2 adults + 4 kids). 

Let's assume the size of each kid's slice is 'x'. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid, the size of each adult's slice is '2x'.

The total number of slices is 6, so the total size of the watermelon can be represented as 6x (since each slice is 'x' in size).

The two adults get 2 slices each, so the total size of the slices for the adults is 2 * 2x = 4x.

The 4 kids get 4 slices each, so the total size of the slices for the kids is 4 * x = 4x.

Since the total size of the watermelon is 6x, and the adults get 4x, the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is (4x / 6x) * 100.

Simplifying the expression, we get (4/6) * 100 = 66.67%.

Therefore, each adult gets approximately 66.67% of the watermelon.

The final answer is: 66.67"
"To determine the time Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on rounds and appointments, and then subtract that from the total hours he works.

First, let's calculate the time spent on rounds. Doctor Jones has 9 inpatients and each round takes 20 minutes. 

Time spent on rounds = 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time spent on rounds to hours:

Time spent on rounds = 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

Next, let's calculate the time spent on appointments. Doctor Jones has 10 appointments and each appointment takes 30 minutes.

Time spent on appointments = 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes

Converting the time spent on appointments to hours:

Time spent on appointments = 300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours

Now, let's add the time spent on rounds and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:

Total time spent = Time spent on rounds + Time spent on appointments = 3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours

Since Doctor Jones works 9 hours at the clinic, we can subtract the total time spent from his total work hours to find the time left to update his records:

Time left to update records = Total work hours - Total time spent = 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required for the entire process. 

First, let's break down the time required for each step:

1. Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
2. Baking the cake: 30 minutes
3. Cooling the cake: 2 hours (120 minutes)
4. Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 2 hours to minutes: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes

Now, we add the remaining time to the 120 minutes: 120 + 60 = 180 minutes

However, we need to convert the total time to hours and minutes for easier calculation: 180 minutes = 3 hours.

Now, we need to find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm. To do this, we subtract the total time required from the desired serving time.

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, Jordan can start making the cake at 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. 
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars. 

Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars, so we can set up the equation: 3.5x + 4.5x = 64.

Combining like terms, we get 8x = 64.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 8: x = 64 / 8.

x = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of the students per session, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

First, let's calculate the cost per session:

Cost of renting the studio: $25
Cost per student: $1.50
Number of students: 10
Cost per session: $25 + (10 * $1.50) = $25 + $15 = $40

Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the total number of sessions in a month is:
3 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month

Now, let's calculate the total cost per session:
Cost per session: $40

The total earnings per session would be the cost per session, as that is the amount the studio charges for each session. 

Total earnings per session: $40

To find the total earnings in a month, we multiply the total earnings per session by the number of sessions in a month:
Total earnings/month = Total earnings per session * Number of sessions/month
Total earnings/month = $40 * 12
Total earnings/month = $480

The final answer is: $480"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many chocolate bars are in each box for both Peter and Martha. 

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each box as 'x'. Since Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, the total number of chocolate bars Peter has is 4x. Similarly, since Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, the total number of chocolate bars Martha has is 7x.

We are given that Peter has a total of 64 chocolate bars and Martha has a total of 56 chocolate bars. So, we can set up the following equations:

4x = 64 (for Peter)
7x = 56 (for Martha)

To find the value of 'x', we can solve these equations. 

For Peter: 
4x = 64
x = 64 / 4
x = 16

For Martha: 
7x = 56
x = 56 / 7
x = 8

Now that we know the number of chocolate bars in each box for both Peter and Martha, we can find the difference in the number of chocolate bars in each box.

Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box, and Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box. The difference is 16 - 8 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of female porcupines in the park. Since the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of female porcupines = (3/5) * Total population
= (3/5) * 50
= 30

Next, we need to find the total number of babies born in a year. Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, and there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

Total babies born in a year = Number of female porcupines * 4 * 12
= 30 * 4 * 12
= 1440

However, this is the number of babies born in a year, not the total number of porcupines. Since the initial population is 50, we need to add the number of babies born in a year to the initial population to get the total number of porcupines after a year.

Total porcupines after a year = Initial population + Total babies born in a year
= 50 + 1440
= 1490

The final answer is: 1490"
"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as a swimming pool) is V = lwh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height (or depth).

Given the dimensions of the pool: length (l) = 25 feet, width (w) = 14 feet, and depth (h) = 4 feet, we can calculate the volume as follows:

V = lwh
V = 25 * 14 * 4
V = 1400 cubic feet

The pool company instructed them to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the number of gallons of water needed. 

First, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. There are 7.48 gallons in a cubic foot, so:

1400 cubic feet * 7.48 gallons/cubic foot = 10472 gallons

Now, we multiply the volume in gallons by 5.9:

10472 gallons * 5.9 = 61851.68 gallons

The cost for the pool company to come and fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon:

61851.68 gallons * $0.10/gallon = $6185.168

Rounding to two decimal places, the cost to fill the pool is approximately $6185.17.

The final answer is: $6185.17"
"To solve this problem, we can start by identifying the number of blue sticks, which is 5 more than the number of red sticks. Since there are 9 red sticks, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

Next, we can determine the number of yellow sticks, which is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. So, the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together: 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the distance traveled by Matteo, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles.

To find the distance traveled by Shandy, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles.

To find the difference in distance traveled between Shandy and Matteo, we subtract the distance traveled by Matteo from the distance traveled by Shandy: 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Half of the students are over 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500 students are over 16 years old.
2. One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male: 1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16 years old.
3. The remaining students are under 16 years old: 3000 - 1500 = 1500 students are under 16 years old.
4. Half of the students under 16 years old are male: 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16 years old.
5. To find the total number of male students, we add the male students over 16 and under 16: 375 + 750 = 1125 male students.
6. Since half of the students are over 16 and the other half are under 16, the number of female students is also half of the total students: 3000 / 2 = 1500 female students.

However, we need to find the number of female students, but we know that the total number of students is 3000, and we know that 1125 of them are male. So, to find the number of female students, we subtract the number of male students from the total number of students: 3000 - 1125 = 1875.

The final answer is: 1875"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of laps each person can run and then find the difference between Bethany and Quinn.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find the difference between Bethany and Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank and subtract it from the tank's capacity.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons. 

The remaining amount of water needed to fill the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as 'x'. 

During the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is 100% - 5 * 9% = 55% of the initial charge. 

Mathematically, this can be represented as: x - (5 * 0.09)x = 0.55x

After 5 hours, the battery starts to lose 7% of its capacity each hour for 3 hours. So, after 3 more hours, the charge remaining is 55% - 3 * 7% = 41% of the initial charge.

Mathematically, this can be represented as: 0.55x - (3 * 0.07)x = 0.41x

Now, we have two equations:

1) x - 0.45x = 0.55x
2) 0.55x - 0.21x = 0.41x

However, the second equation is not necessary as it is a simplified version of the first equation. We can directly use the first equation to find the initial charge.

x - 0.45x = 0.55x
0.55x = 0.45x
0.1x = 0.55x - 0.45x
0.1x = 0.1x
0.1x = 0.1x

This equation is true for any value of x, which means we need to use the information that the final charge remaining is 28% of the initial charge. 

Let's set up the equation: x - (5 * 0.09)x - (3 * 0.07)x = 0.28x

x - 0.45x - 0.21x = 0.28x
x - 0.66x = 0.28x
-0.66x = -0.38x
x = 0.38 / 0.66
x = 0.57697 (approximately)

The initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 57.7%."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate Janet's total weekly earnings and then determine how many weeks it will take her to save 20% of the car's cost.

First, let's calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, so her total hourly earnings are $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25/hour * 40 hours/week = $1000/week.

Next, we need to calculate 20% of the car's cost. 20% of $10,000 is 0.20 * $10,000 = $2000.

Now, we can divide the amount Janet needs to save ($2000) by her weekly earnings ($1000) to determine how many weeks she needs to work: $2000 / $1000 = 2.

Therefore, Janet will need to work 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Jamaar has already purchased and subtract that from his budget to find out how much he has left to spend on plums.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items he has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.5 each: 4 * $0.5 = $2
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of items purchased: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar's remaining budget: $10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can calculate how many plums he can buy with his remaining budget:

Number of plums he can buy: $0.75 / $0.25 = 3

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of packs Anne gave to her friends. Since she kept 2 packs for herself, she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Next, we need to find out how many packs each friend received. Since there are 10 friends, we divide the total number of packs given away (13) by the number of friends (10). 

13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs per friend. However, since each pack contains 60 pieces, we need to multiply the number of packs each friend received by the number of pieces in each pack.

1.3 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 78 pieces per friend.

"To determine the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price. 

The original price of carrots is $120. 

Year 1: The price increases by 5% of $120, which is 0.05 * $120 = $6. 
The new price after the first year is $120 + $6 = $126.

Year 2: The price increases by 5% of $126, which is 0.05 * $126 = $6.30. 
The new price after the second year is $126 + $6.30 = $132.30.

Year 3: The price increases by 5% of $132.30, which is 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615. 
The new price after the third year is $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know that Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums. This means that the total number of pictures is divisible by 8. Since she uploaded 72 pictures, we can confirm that 72 is indeed divisible by 8 (72 ÷ 8 = 9).

Next, we are told that 3 of the albums were selfies only and 2 of the albums were portraits. This means that the remaining 3 albums must contain a mix of portraits and selfies, but since we don't have any information about the number of pictures in these mixed albums, we can't determine the exact number of portraits and selfies in them.

However, we can determine the total number of selfies and portraits by considering the total number of albums. Since 3 albums are selfies only and 2 are portraits, the remaining 3 albums must contain a mix of both. 

Let's denote the number of selfies in the mixed albums as 'x'. Then, the number of portraits in the mixed albums is also 'x'. The total number of selfies is the sum of the selfies in the selfies-only albums and the selfies in the mixed albums, which is 3x + 3 (since there are 3 selfies-only albums). Similarly, the total number of portraits is the sum of the portraits in the portraits-only albums and the portraits in the mixed albums, which is 2x + 2.

We know that the total number of pictures is 72, and the total number of albums is 8. Since each album contains the same number of pictures, the total number of pictures is equal to the total number of albums multiplied by the number of pictures per album, which is 8 * 9 = 72. However, this is not the case here, as we are given the total number of pictures. 

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of pictures: 3x + 3 + 2x + 2 + 3x = 72. This equation represents the total number of selfies and portraits. 

Combine like terms: 8x + 5 = 72.

Subtract 5 from both sides: 8x = 67.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 8.375.

Since we can't have a fraction of a picture, this solution is not valid. However, we can try to find the closest integer solution. 

Let's try x = 8. Since x represents the number of selfies in the mixed albums, the number of portraits in the mixed albums is also 8. The total number of selfies is 3x + 3 = 3(8) + 3 = 27. The total number of portraits is 2x + 2 = 2(8) + 2 = 18.

However, this solution is not the only possible solution. We can try x = 9. The total number of selfies is 3x + 3 = 3(9) + 3 = 30. The total number of portraits is 2x + 2 = 2(9) + 2 = 20.

We can try x = 7. The total number of selfies is 3x + 3 = 3(7) + 3 = 24. The total number of portraits is 2x + 2 = 2(7) + 2 = 16.

"To determine the time James spends reading, we need to calculate the total number of pages he reads and then multiply it by the time it takes him to read one page.

James reads 18 pages, and it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages. To find out how long it takes him to read one page, we divide the time by the number of pages: 10 minutes / 3 pages = 3.33 minutes per page.

Now, we multiply the time it takes to read one page by the total number of pages: 3.33 minutes per page * 18 pages = 60 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.

24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests remaining is 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, so the number of guests remaining is still 76.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30. So, the number of guests now is 76 + 30 = 106.

After dinner, 7 more people checked in, so the final number of guests is 106 + 7 = 113.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of questions in each category. 

40% of the 60 questions are easy, so the number of easy questions is 0.4 * 60 = 24.

The rest of the questions are equally divided between average and difficult, so there are 60 - 24 = 36 questions left. This means there are 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 0.75 * 24 = 18 easy questions.

She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 0.5 * 18 = 9 average questions and 0.5 * 18 = 9 difficult questions.

The total number of questions Aries is sure to get is 18 (easy) + 9 (average) + 9 (difficult) = 36.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 's' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'l'. We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write an equation:

s = 2l

We also know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, and the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small one, which is $12. The total earnings from the sales are $120. We can write another equation based on the total earnings:

4s + 12l = 120

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second one to solve for 'l':

4(2l) + 12l = 120
8l + 12l = 120
20l = 120
l = 6

Now that we know the number of large stuffed animals, we can find the number of small stuffed animals:

s = 2l
s = 2(6)
s = 12

"To determine the total number of sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches each family member eats in a week and then sum them up.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, so in a week (7 days), he eats 5 * 7 = 35 sandwiches.

The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, so in a week (7 days), she eats 4 * 7 = 28 sandwiches.

The son eats 2 sandwiches per day, so in a week (7 days), he eats 2 * 7 = 14 sandwiches.

Now, let's add up the total number of sandwiches the family eats in a week: 35 (man) + 28 (wife) + 14 (son) = 77 sandwiches.

60 cupcakes * $4 each = $240

Now, let's add the earnings from cookies and cupcakes: 
$80 + $240 = $320

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so the total amount given to her sisters is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then multiply it by 40 dwarves and 30 days.

First, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. We know that he can mine 12 pounds with his bare hands and 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe. 

Since he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe, he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds with an iron pickaxe. 

Now, 50% more than 24 pounds is 24 + (24 * 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds. 

So, one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day: 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds.

Finally, let's calculate the total amount of ore 40 dwarves can mine in 30 days: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of proportionality. Let's denote the price of the package with 8 sandwiches as x.

We know that the price of the first package (2 sandwiches) is $3, and the price of the second package (4 sandwiches) is $6. We can set up a proportion to relate the prices and the number of sandwiches:

(2 sandwiches / $3) = (4 sandwiches / $6) = (8 sandwiches / x)

We can simplify the first two ratios to get:

(1/1.5) = (2/3) = (8/x)

Now, we can equate the second and third ratios:

(2/3) = (8/x)

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

2x = 8 * 3
2x = 24

Now, we can divide both sides by 2 to get:

x = 24 / 2
x = 12

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much Tom still owes after selling his old bedroom set. 

Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000 and sells his old bedroom for $1000. 

The amount he still owes is $3000 - $1000 = $2000.

Since he has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we need to calculate 10% of $2000.

10% of $2000 is calculated as 0.1 * $2000 = $200.

Therefore, Tom has to pay $200 per month. 

The final answer is: $200"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst, so the number of red balloons remaining is 25 - (40% of 25) = 25 - 10 = 15.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons, so the number of yellow balloons remaining is 12 - (1/2 * 12) = 12 - 6 = 6.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 75% of 8 is 6, so she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch. The total number of balloons she had at this point is 15 (red) + 7 (green) + 6 (yellow) + 6 (blue) = 34.

Therefore, the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school is 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the different scenarios in which Marcus will have to turn in his homework. 

First, let's consider the scenario where the substitute teacher is present. In this case, there's a 50% chance that the substitute won't collect the homework, so Marcus won't have to turn it in. 

Now, let's consider the scenario where the normal teacher is present. In this case, there's a 60% chance that Marcus won't have to turn in his homework (40% chance of an extension for the whole class + 20% chance of a personal extension). 

We can calculate the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework as follows:

Probability of having to turn in homework with substitute teacher: 50% * 100% = 50%
Probability of having to turn in homework with normal teacher: 50% * 60% = 30%

Since these are mutually exclusive events, we can add the probabilities together to get the total probability of having to turn in homework:

50% + 30% = 80%

However, this is the probability that Marcus won't turn in his homework. To find the probability that he will turn in his homework, we need to subtract this from 100%:

100% - 80% = 20%

So, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 20%."
"To find out how many tickets each graduate can receive, we first need to determine the total number of available seats for guests. 

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center: 6000
Seats reserved for graduates: 950
Seats reserved for faculty: 300

Total reserved seats: 950 + 300 = 1250

Available seats for guests: 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive.

4750 / 950 = 5

Each graduate can receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the different sizes of jelly beans. Let's denote the number of small beans as S, the number of medium beans as M, and the number of large beans as L.

We are given that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium bean, so we can write this as:

3S = M

We are also given that Grandpa can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, so we can write this as:

M = 2L

We are given that it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up, so we can write this as:

L = 75

Now, we can substitute the value of L into the equation M = 2L to find the value of M:

M = 2(75)
M = 150

Now, we can substitute the value of M into the equation 3S = M to find the value of S:

3S = 150
S = 150 / 3
S = 50

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans.

"To determine Melissa's hourly wage after expenses, we need to first calculate her total earnings and total expenses. 

Her total earnings can be calculated by multiplying her daily pay by the number of days she worked: $15/day * 3 days = $45.

Her total expenses can be calculated by multiplying her daily parking expense by the number of days she worked: $3/day * 3 days = $9.

Now, we can calculate her net earnings by subtracting her total expenses from her total earnings: $45 - $9 = $36.

To find her hourly wage, we need to divide her net earnings by the total number of hours she worked: 6 hours/day * 3 days = 18 hours. 

Her hourly wage after expenses is: $36 / 18 hours = $2 per hour.

The final answer is: $2"
"This question seems to be a simple arithmetic problem, but let's break it down step by step to ensure we understand the process.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the books. Since Ted buys 3 books for 16 dollars each, we multiply the number of books by the cost per book: 3 * 16 = 48 dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the pencils. Ted buys 3 pencils for 6 dollars each, so we multiply the number of pencils by the cost per pencil: 3 * 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the books and the total cost of the pencils to find the overall amount spent: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

Therefore, Ted spent a total of 66 dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of soda bottles Richard will place along the driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes him to place each one.

First, let's find the total number of soda bottles. The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the width of the driveway by the spacing between the bottles:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will place 8 bottles in total.

Next, we need to find the total time it will take Richard to place all the bottles. It takes him 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, and he will do this 8 times (for 8 bottles). To find the total time, we multiply the time per bottle by the number of bottles:

5 seconds per bottle * 8 bottles = 40 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 40 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

The final answer is: 40"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of apples Uncle Franky has. Since he ordered two boxes of apples and each box contains 40 apples, we can calculate the total number of apples as follows:

Total apples = 2 boxes * 40 apples/box = 80 apples

Next, we need to find out how many packs of apples Uncle Franky can make with the total number of apples. Since each pack contains 8 apples, we can divide the total number of apples by 8 to find the number of packs:

Number of packs = Total apples / 8 apples/pack = 80 apples / 8 apples/pack = 10 packs

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the two boxes of apples.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost due to loans and lost income while in college. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of loans he took: 
4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money he lost due to not working while in college. 
His income before college was $25,000/year. 
His income after college is $25,000 * 3 = $75,000/year. 
The difference in income is $75,000 - $25,000 = $50,000/year. 
The total amount of money he lost due to not working while in college is $50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000.

The total amount of money Jim lost is $200,000 (loans) + $200,000 (lost income) = $400,000.

Now, let's calculate how long it would take Jim to earn this amount at his new income. 
$400,000 / $75,000/year = 5.33 years.

"To determine the amount of fabric Jim needs, we must first calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces. The bed measures 6 feet by 8 feet, so the fabric pieces will be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than that. 

The length of the fabric pieces will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet (original length) + 2 feet (additional length) = 10 feet. 
The width of the fabric pieces will be 8 + 2 = 10 feet.

Now, we can calculate the area of one fabric piece by multiplying the length and width: 10 feet * 10 feet = 100 square feet. Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply this area by 2: 100 square feet * 2 = 200 square feet.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 17 more than that is 85 + 17 = 102. So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 5 more than that is 204 + 5 = 209. So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we add the number of letters delivered each day: 425 + 102 + 209 = 736.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the share of the first person as x. 

Since the second person took $80 more than the first, the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Combine like terms: x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920.

Combine like terms again: 4x + 240 = 1920.

Subtract 240 from both sides: 4x = 1680.

Divide both sides by 4: x = 420.

The share of the first person is $420.

The final answer is: $420"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's calculate the total number of days in 3 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since the painters worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to convert 3/8ths to a decimal. 3/8ths is equal to 0.375.

Now, we multiply the number of days by the fraction of the day worked: 21 days * 0.375 = 7.875 days.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply the total days worked by 24 to get the total hours worked: 7.875 * 24 = 189 hours.

Finally, we divide the total hours worked by the number of painters to get the hours worked by each painter: 189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we need to combine like terms and isolate x. 

First, we multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Expanding the equation:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set by substituting x into the expression x + 4:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation of the car from 2007 to 2010. 

The car was bought in 2007, so we need to calculate the depreciation for 3 years (2008, 2009, and 2010).

The formula for depreciation is: 

Price after depreciation = Initial price * (1 - depreciation rate)^number of years

The depreciation rate is 21% or 0.21. 

For 2008: Price after depreciation = 20000 * (1 - 0.21) = 20000 * 0.79 = 15800
For 2009: Price after depreciation = 15800 * (1 - 0.21) = 15800 * 0.79 = 12532
For 2010: Price after depreciation = 12532 * (1 - 0.21) = 12532 * 0.79 = 9925.48

The price of the car in 2010 is $9925.48."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to determine the total number of books that are not written in English. Since half of the books are written in English, that's 50 / 2 = 25 books in English.

We are also given that 10% of the books are written in German. To find the number of German books, we calculate 10% of 50, which is 0.1 * 50 = 5 books in German.

Now, to find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books. So, 50 - 25 (English) - 5 (German) = 20 books in Spanish.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance. 

First, let's calculate the total distance Bernice has driven: 
Distance driven = 325 kilometers/day * 4 days = 1300 kilometers

Now, let's subtract the distance driven from the total distance:
Total distance = 1955 kilometers
Distance driven = 1300 kilometers
Distance left = Total distance - Distance driven
Distance left = 1955 - 1300
Distance left = 655 kilometers

The final answer is: 655"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of cups Ingrid drinks in 30 days and then convert that to gallons.

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. To find the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days, we multiply the number of cups she drinks per day by 30:

8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can convert the total number of cups to gallons by dividing the total number of cups by 16:

240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 120 people on the train.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the total number of people becomes 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (100) board the train. So, the total number of people becomes 140 - 50 + 100 = 190.

At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the total number of people becomes 190 - 80 = 110.

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"To determine the total amount Alison spent on athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

1. The tank top costs $10.
2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The athletic socks cost $8, and she had a coupon for $2 off, so they cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:

$10 (tank top) + $15 (shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55

The final answer is: $55"
"To determine the total cost of renovating your kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and then multiply that by the cost per tile.

First, let's find the area of a single tile. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1 ft, the area of a single tile is 1 ft * 1 ft = 1 SqFt.

Next, we need to find the total number of tiles required to cover the kitchen floor. Since the total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt and each tile covers 1 SqFt, we need 200 tiles.

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of tiles by the cost per tile: 200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"To find the increased cost of the insurance, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

60% of $120 is 0.6 * $120 = $72. 

The increased cost is $120 + $72 = $192.

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we need to multiply it by 12 to get the annual cost.

$192 * 12 = $2304.

The final answer is: $2304"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of sheets Greg puts on the beds in a week and then divide that by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. Since each twin bed requires 1 set of sheets and the king size bed requires 1 set of sheets, the total number of sheets he puts on the beds in a week is 4 + 1 = 5 sets.

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time, we need to convert the total number of sheets to the number of loads. We can wash 2 twin sets of sheets (2 * 2 = 4 sheets) and 1 king set of sheets (1 set) in one load. So, we can wash 5 sets of sheets in 2 loads (2 loads of 2 twin sets and 1 king set each).

However, we have 4 twin sets of sheets left, which require 2 more loads (2 loads of 2 twin sets each). Therefore, the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a week is 2 + 2 = 4 loads.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year is 4 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 208 loads/year.

The final answer is: 208"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of movies Jill and her friends watch in one weekend and then multiply it by the number of weeks.

In one weekend, they watch 4 movies on Saturday and half the number of movies on Sunday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies. So, in one weekend, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

Since they watch movies every weekend, in 4 weeks, they will watch 6 movies per weekend * 4 weeks = 24 movies.

The final numerical answer is: 24"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, we know that two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. 

Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so we add that to the initial number: 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.

This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which was 50. So, this year he collected 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Now, we add the stickers collected this year to the total from last year: 150 + 100 = 250 stickers.

Therefore, Leo now has 250 stickers in his collection.

The final answer is: 250"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days the available cat food will last. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of cat food Imma feeds her cats per day. Since she feeds her 3 cats twice a day with 60 grams of cat food each time, the total amount of cat food per day is:

3 cats * 2 feedings * 60 grams = 360 grams per day

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. To do this, we can divide the total amount of cat food available (720 grams) by the amount of cat food consumed per day (360 grams):

720 grams / 360 grams per day = 2 days

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days.

The final answer is: 2"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of slices each person ate and then add them up.

We know Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake did, Jake must have eaten 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

We also know Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake did, so Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

Now, we can add up the total number of slices eaten by all three: 10 (Becky) + 7 (Jake) + 14 (Silvia) = 31.

The final answer is: 31"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's denote the time it took Donovan to make his part as 'x'. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, the time it took Betsy to make her part is 'x + 18'.

The total time it took to make the meal is the sum of the time it took Donovan and Betsy, which is given as 98 minutes. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:

2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

Since x represents the time it took Donovan to make his part, and Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's part took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

The final answer is: 58"
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to break down the costs and add them up.

1. The cost of the cast is $200.
2. The doctor charges $300/hour for a 30-minute visit. To find the total cost of the visit, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is 0.5 hours. The cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.
3. The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill for 30 pills. The total cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.
4. The cost of parking is $6/hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours. The total cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"To find out how many emails James responds to, we first need to determine how many emails he receives that require a response. 

First, let's calculate the number of emails that don't require a response: 20% of 80 emails is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails.

Now, let's find out how many emails require a response: 80 emails - 16 emails = 64 emails.

Since James responds to all the emails that require a response, he responds to 64 emails per day.

To find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to per day by 5: 64 emails/day * 5 days = 320 emails.

On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 64 = 192 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the number of classes that visited each day:

"To find the average score, we need to calculate the total score and then divide it by the number of tests. 

First, let's find the total score. John scored 100 on his first 3 tests, so the total score for those tests is 3 x 100 = 300. Then, he scored 80 on his 4th test. 

Now, we add the score of the 4th test to the total score of the first 3 tests: 300 + 80 = 380.

Next, we divide the total score by the number of tests: 380 / 4 = 95.

The average score across the 4 tests is 95.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team, and then subtract that from the total number of pizzas ordered.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club, we multiply 20 by 0.7 (which is 70% expressed as a decimal).

20 * 0.7 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

Now, we add the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team: 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas eaten in total.

The total number of pizzas ordered is 20 (by the glee club) + 40 (by the football team) = 60 pizzas.

To find the number of pizzas left, we subtract the total number of pizzas eaten from the total number of pizzas ordered: 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas left.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of big coupons. Since Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and he is sending out 700 small coupons, he will send out 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons.

The cost of mailing the small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

The cost of mailing the big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

Therefore, Anthony spends $245 on postage in total.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. This means Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

2. Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. So, the total number of meatballs in the 7 sub sandwiches is 7 * 4 = 28.

3. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. This means there are now 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches left.

4. Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches. Now, the total number of sub sandwiches is 3 + 3 = 6.

5. The total number of meatballs in the 6 sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of trucks that experienced mechanical failures. Since a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of trucks = 20
Fraction of trucks with mechanical failures = 1/4

Number of trucks with mechanical failures = Number of trucks * Fraction of trucks with mechanical failures
= 20 * (1/4)
= 5

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that did not reach the farmers is:

Total fertiliser not delivered = Number of trucks with mechanical failures * Tons per truck
= 5 * 20
= 100 tons

Now, to find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we subtract the amount not delivered from the total amount dispatched:

Total tons of fertiliser dispatched = Number of trucks * Tons per truck
= 20 * 20
= 400 tons

Total tons of fertiliser delivered = Total tons of fertiliser dispatched - Total fertiliser not delivered
= 400 - 100
= 300 tons

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the butter, taking into account the promotion. 

First, let's determine how many pounds of butter Dennis needs. Since he needs to make 6 dozen croissants and he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen, he needs 6 pounds of butter.

Since the promotion is buy one pound of butter get one half off, we can calculate the cost as follows:

- For the first pound, the cost is $4.00.
- For the second pound, the cost is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00 (since it's half off).

Now, let's calculate the total cost for 6 pounds of butter:

- For the first 3 pounds, the cost is 3 * $4.00 = $12.00.
- For the next 3 pounds, the cost is 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.

The total cost is $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00.

"To determine the total cost of the party, we need to calculate the number of guests and then apply the given fee structure.

First, let's calculate the total number of guests: 
Kayla invited 25 classmates + 7 girls from her dance class + 13 family members = 45 guests. However, 4 people said they could not come, so the actual number of guests is 45 - 4 = 41.

Since the initial fee is for 20 guests, we need to calculate the additional guests: 41 - 20 = 21.

The fee for the additional guests is $6 per person, so the total fee for the additional guests is 21 * $6 = $126.

The initial fee for 20 guests is $125. Adding the fee for the additional guests, the total cost is $125 + $126 = $251.

The final numerical answer is: $251"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much money Maggie and Riza had initially. Since they each had $60 after spending a portion of their money, we can work backwards to find the initial amount.

Let's denote the initial amount of money Maggie had as M and the initial amount of money Riza had as R. We know that Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has 3/4 of her initial amount left. Similarly, Riza spent one-third of her money, so she has 2/3 of her initial amount left.

We can set up the following equations:

M - (1/4)M = 60 (Maggie's remaining money)
R - (1/3)R = 60 (Riza's remaining money)

Simplifying the equations, we get:

(3/4)M = 60
(2/3)R = 60

To find the initial amount of money each had, we can multiply both sides of each equation by the reciprocal of the fraction:

M = 60 * (4/3)
R = 60 * (3/2)

M = 80
R = 90

Now that we know the initial amount of money each had, we can find the total initial amount:

Total initial amount = M + R
= 80 + 90
= 170

Since they spent a portion of their money, we need to find the total amount they spent. Maggie spent 1/4 of her money, which is (1/4) * 80 = 20. Riza spent 1/3 of her money, which is (1/3) * 90 = 30.

Total amount spent = 20 + 30
= 50

Now, we can find the total amount of money they have left:

Total amount left = Total initial amount - Total amount spent
= 170 - 50
= 120

The final answer is: 120"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many bananas each monkey eats per day. 

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. 

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

Since there are three monkeys, the total number of bananas they eat per day is 10 + 14 + x, where x is the number of bananas the third monkey eats per day.

We know that the total number of bananas is 315, and they eat this amount for a week, which is 7 days. So, the total number of bananas eaten per day is 315 / 7 = 45.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the situation: 10 + 14 + x = 45.

Simplifying the equation, we get 24 + x = 45.

Subtracting 24 from both sides, we get x = 21.

Therefore, the third monkey eats 21 bananas per day.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses and then determine how much change Jenny will receive.

First, let's calculate the cost of the roses. Jenny bought 15 roses, but since a dozen roses cost $15, we can calculate the cost of the remaining roses as follows:

15 roses - 12 roses (1 dozen) = 3 roses
Cost of 3 roses = 3 x $2 = $6
Cost of 1 dozen roses = $15
Total cost of 15 roses = $6 + $15 = $21

Jenny paid with five $5 bills, which is a total of $25. To find out how much change she will receive, we subtract the total cost of the roses from the amount she paid:

Change = $25 - $21 = $4

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the change into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so:

$4 = 4 x $1 = 4 x 4 quarters = 16 quarters

Jenny leaves with 16 quarters.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station. Since the first train leaves at 30 minutes, the second train arrives at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.

3. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

4. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station. Since the second train leaves at 65 minutes, the third train arrives at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes.

5. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

6. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station. Since the third train leaves at 125 minutes, the fourth train arrives at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

7. Paul will board the fourth train, which arrives at 145 minutes. Since he is at the station at time 0, he will wait for 145 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far and then calculate how many more weeks it will take her to reach 200 toothpicks.

Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. To find the total number of toothpicks she has saved, we multiply the number of toothpicks saved per week by the number of weeks:

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks for the sculpture, we subtract the number of toothpicks she has saved from the total required:

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Melanie to save the remaining 80 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week:

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, Melanie will need 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and then the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price, so the price he paid is:

2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Then, he sold it to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, so the price his friend paid is:

1500 * 1.20 = $1800

To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to find the difference between the original price and the price his friend paid, and then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100:

Now, we add 15 to 180 to find Frankie's score: 180 + 15 = 195.

Frankie's score was 195."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it took James to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.

First, let's calculate the time it took James to walk to the store. Since he walked halfway to the store, he walked 2 miles (half of 4 miles). 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 2 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 0.5 hours

However, this is the time it took him to walk to the halfway point. He then walked back home, which is another 2 miles. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 2 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 0.5 hours

Since he walked to the halfway point and back, we need to add the two times together.

Total time = 0.5 hours + 0.5 hours
Total time = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually and compare it to the cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny buys: 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

If she buys the bananas individually, the cost would be: 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

If she buys the bananas in bunches, the cost would be: 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

To find the amount of money she saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Therefore, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as 'x'. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets 'x + 60' feet.

We know that the total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

This means Sam gets 20 feet of fence. To find out how much is left over for Sam, we need to subtract the amount he gets from the total amount of fence. However, the question asks how much is left over for Sam, which implies that we need to find the leftover amount after both Sam and Harry have taken their respective portions. 

Since the total amount of fence is 100 feet, and Sam and Harry together have 20 + (20 + 60) = 100 feet, there is no leftover amount for Sam."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of proportional reasoning, which is related to the idea of proportionality in mathematics. This concept is also connected to the philosophical idea of proportion and analogy, which is discussed in the works of ancient Greek philosophers such as Aristotle.

In this case, we can set up a proportion to find the rate at which the crocodile grows per year. If the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, we can divide 8 by 4 to find the rate of growth per year.

8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year

Now, we can multiply this rate by the number of years we want to find the growth for, which is 13 years.

2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

Therefore, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

26"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many bikes of each type were sold and then calculate the total earnings.

Let's break down the information given:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Half of them were Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes
- 15% were BMX bikes: 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45 BMX bikes
- The rest were MTB bikes: 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes

Now, let's calculate the earnings for each type of bike:
- Price of MTB: $500
- Price of BMX: Half the price of MTB, so $500 / 2 = $250
- Price of Trekking: $450

Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500
Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250
Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500

Total earnings: $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the net change in the number of bales of hay in the field over the course of the 6-hour day.

The farmer produces 5 bales of hay per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer will produce 5 * 6 = 30 bales of hay.

The truck picks up 3 bales of hay per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck will pick up 3 * 6 = 18 bales of hay.

The net change in the number of bales of hay in the field is the difference between the number of bales produced and the number of bales picked up, which is 30 - 18 = 12 bales.

Since the farmer produces 30 bales and the truck picks up 18 bales, there are 12 bales left in the field.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time John spends in class and the extra time he spends on Saturday and Sunday.

First, let's calculate the total time John spends in class. He has 2 extra classes, each 40 minutes long, and he goes to class for 5 days a week. 

Time spent in class per day = 2 * 40 minutes = 80 minutes
Time spent in class per week = 80 minutes * 5 days = 400 minutes

Now, let's calculate the extra time John spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time. 

There are 7 days in a week, so the total minutes in a week = 7 * 24 * 60 = 16800 minutes

Extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday = 1/16 * 16800 minutes = 1050 minutes

Now, let's add the time spent in class and the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday to get the total time spent learning.

Total time spent learning = 400 minutes + 1050 minutes = 1450 minutes

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60.

Total time spent learning in hours = 1450 minutes / 60 = 24.17 hours

The final answer is: 24.17"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the height of the ball after each bounce. 

The initial height from which the ball is dropped is 3 stories * 24 feet/story = 72 feet.

On the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of the initial height, which is (2/3) * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of the height it reached after the first bounce, which is (2/3) * 48 = 32 feet.

Therefore, the height of the ball on its second bounce is 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To solve this problem, we need to convert the height of the first child from feet to inches, as the subsequent heights are given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to determine the number of bags sold and then multiply that by the price per bag.

Since the orchard sold a total of 2000 apples and each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag to find the number of bags sold:

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now, we can multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag to find the total earnings:

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The final answer is: $1000"
"To solve this problem, we can work backwards from the information given. 

Let's start with the fact that the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. Since they ate the last portion, the velociraptors must have eaten the remaining half of the meat that was left after the T-Rex ate its portion. 

So, if the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, and that was the last half, then the total meat left after the T-Rex ate its portion must have been 2 * 270 = 540 kilograms.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the total meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate must have been twice the amount left after the T-Rex ate. 

Therefore, the total meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate is 2 * 540 = 1080 kilograms.

The final answer is: 1080"
"To determine the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total surface area of the walls that need to be painted. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two walls, their total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two walls, their total area is 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

The total surface area of the walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the total number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost of painting the room is 12 * 12 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability of two events: 

1. The shaken can is selected, and 
2. The shaken can is opened.

First, let's calculate the probability of selecting a shaken can. There are 9 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas, making a total of 12 sodas. The probability of selecting a shaken can is 3/12, which simplifies to 1/4 or 0.25.

Now, let's calculate the probability of opening a shaken can. Since Ellen's brother took 1 shaken can and 2 unshaken cans, there are now 2 shaken cans and 7 unshaken cans left. The probability of selecting a shaken can is 2/9.

However, since Ellen's friend is more likely to get sprayed if the shaken can is opened, we need to consider the probability of opening a shaken can. The probability of opening a shaken can is the same as the probability of selecting a shaken can, which is 2/9.

To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we multiply the probability of selecting a shaken can by the probability of opening it: (2/9) * (2/9) = 4/81.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (4/81) * 100 = 4.94%."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add their distances together to find the total distance between them. So, the total distance is 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of days Billy works and then multiply it by the number of people he can help per hour, and then by the number of hours he works per day.

First, let's find the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th, so the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. To do this, we multiply 50 by 0.2, which is 10. So, Billy takes 10 days off.

Now, we subtract the number of days off from the total number of days to find the number of days he works: 50 - 10 = 40.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so the total number of people he can help per day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, we multiply the number of days he works by the number of people he can help per day: 40 * 6 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people who were transported by the buses and the cars, and then subtract that from the total number of people who attended the wedding.

First, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the buses: 12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people.

Next, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the cars: 20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people.

Now, let's add the number of people transported by the buses and the cars: 420 people + 60 people = 480 people.

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we need to assume that the remaining people who were not transported by the buses or cars were already inside the church. However, the question does not provide this information. 

However, we can assume that the question is asking for the total number of people who attended the wedding, which is the sum of the people inside the church and the people transported by the buses and cars. 

Therefore, the total number of people who attended the wedding is the sum of the people transported by the buses and cars and the number of private cars, which is 480 people + 20 people = 500 people.

The final answer is: 500"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of Martha first, and then use that information to find Jeff's age.

Since Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can calculate Martha's age by subtracting 4 from Mike's age:

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now that we know Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age since he is 10 years older than Martha:

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

"To find the time it takes to ride each waterslide, we need to divide the length of each slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest waterslide: time = length / speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest waterslide: time = length / speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide from the time it takes to ride the biggest slide: 
time difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time spent on lunches and breaks over 5 days.

First, let's calculate the total time spent on lunch per day: 30 minutes. 

Next, let's calculate the total time spent on breaks per day: 2 breaks * 15 minutes per break = 30 minutes.

Now, let's add the time spent on lunch and breaks per day: 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes per day.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can convert 60 minutes to hours: 60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour.

Now, let's multiply the time spent per day by the number of days: 1 hour * 5 days = 5 hours.

The total time spent on lunches and breaks over 5 days is 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

Micah's distance = 3.5 * Amber's distance
Micah's distance = 3.5 * 8
Micah's distance = 28 miles

Now that we know Micah's distance, we can find Ahito's distance by subtracting the combined distance of Amber and Micah from the total distance:

Ahito's distance = Total distance - (Amber's distance + Micah's distance)
Ahito's distance = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's distance = 52 - 36
Ahito's distance = 16 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. Initially, Sheila charged $85.00 worth of merchandise on her credit card.
2. She returned one item that cost $15.00, so we subtract this from the initial charge: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.
3. Now, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan. It was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply $20.00 by 0.20 (20% as a decimal): $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00. The sale price of the frying pan is $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.
4. Next, let's calculate the cost of the set of towels. It was 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we multiply $30.00 by 0.10 (10% as a decimal): $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00. The sale price of the towels is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.
5. Now, we add the cost of the frying pan and the towels to the balance after the return: $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00.

The new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue, so the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means x/15 = 6.

To find the total number of jellyfish, we can solve for x: x/15 = 6 => x = 6 * 15 = 90.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the ages of Caroline, Ben, and Chris. 

Let's denote Chris's age as C, Ben's age as B, and Caroline's age as A. We are given that Chris is 4 years old, so C = 4.

We are also given that Ben is two times older than Chris, so B = 2C. Substituting the value of C, we get B = 2 * 4 = 8.

Lastly, we are given that Caroline is three times older than Ben, so A = 3B. Substituting the value of B, we get A = 3 * 8 = 24.

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Lauren needs to save for her retirement. 

First, let's calculate her annual expenses in retirement: 40% of $100,000 is $40,000.

Since she plans to live for 20 years in retirement, her total expenses will be $40,000 * 20 = $800,000.

Lauren saves 20% of her current salary, which is $100,000 * 0.2 = $20,000 per year.

To find out how many years she needs to work to save $800,000, we can divide the total amount needed by the annual savings: $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save for retirement. Since she already plans to live for 20 years in retirement, we need to subtract this from the total number of years: 40 - 20 = 20 years.

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 20 more years to save for her retirement.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the length of each of the 4 equal parts that Marty will cut the ribbon into. Since the total length of the ribbon is 100 centimeters and it is to be divided into 4 equal parts, we can find the length of each part by dividing 100 by 4.

100 cm / 4 = 25 cm

Now, each of these 25 cm parts will be further divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these smaller parts, we can divide 25 by 5.

25 cm / 5 = 5 cm

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

where x is the total number of students in the school.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

Now that we know the total number of students in the school is 600, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total:

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days she has for her vacation. Since she is on vacation for the entire month of June, which has 30 days, she has 30 days to complete her 9,300-mile journey.

If she hikes twice a day, covering 125 miles each time, her daily total is 2 * 125 = 250 miles per day.

To find out how many days it will take her to complete her journey at this rate, we divide the total miles by the daily miles: 9,300 / 250 = 37.2 days.

Since she only has 30 days, she will not be able to complete her journey on time. To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we need to calculate the difference between the number of days she has and the number of days it will take her to complete her journey at her current rate.

The difference is 37.2 - 30 = 7.2 days. 

Since she hikes twice a day, we need to find out how many more miles she must hike per day. We can do this by multiplying the number of days by 2: 7.2 * 2 = 14.4 miles.

However, since you asked for a numerical answer, we can round this to a more reasonable number.

"To determine the total amount the store will receive after selling all the balls, we need to calculate the total revenue from each color of ball and then sum them up.

The store has 3 red balls, each costing $9. So, the total revenue from red balls is 3 * $9 = $27.

The store has 11 blue balls, each costing $5. So, the total revenue from blue balls is 11 * $5 = $55.

The store has 25 green balls, each costing $3. So, the total revenue from green balls is 25 * $3 = $75.

Now, let's add up the revenues from all the balls: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157.

The store will receive a total of $157 after selling all the balls.

"This question seems to be a simple arithmetic problem, but it's actually a classic example of a philosophical conundrum when considering the concept of identity and the implications of the names. However, to provide a numerical answer, we'll have to assume that the names mentioned are indeed referring to the same individuals, and that the question is asking about the remaining amount after Pierre, Paul, and Jacques (who is not mentioned in the initial statement, but is implied to be the third person) have taken their respective portions.

Let's break it down:

- Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 0.25 = 3 kg.
- Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * (1/3) = 4 kg.

Now, let's assume Jacques also wants a portion, but the question doesn't specify. However, since the question asks about James, it seems there might be a mix-up in names. Assuming Jacques is the third person, and James is not mentioned in the initial statement, we'll proceed with the assumption that Jacques is the third person.

If we assume Jacques wants the remaining portion, we can calculate it as follows:

Total taken by Pierre and Paul = 3 kg + 4 kg = 7 kg.

Remaining amount = 12 kg - 7 kg = 5 kg.

However, since the question asks about James, and there's no information about James, we'll assume the question is asking about the remaining amount after Pierre, Paul, and Jacques have taken their portions.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount Anna spent on books and then divide that by 2, since both books cost the same amount.

Anna's initial budget was $16, and she spent $4 before buying the books. This leaves her with $16 - $4 = $12. However, she has $2 left after buying the books, so she must have spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the two books.

Since both books cost the same amount, we can divide the total spent on books ($10) by 2 to find the cost of each book. 

The cost of each book is $10 / 2 = $5.

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of proportionality. If the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, we can find the rate at which it blinks per minute. 

Let's calculate the rate of blinking per minute: 
255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute.

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times at this rate. We can set up a proportion to solve for the time:

51 blinks/minute * x minutes = 459 blinks

To find x, we can divide both sides by 51:
x = 459 / 51
x = 9

Therefore, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times.

Total female fishes = 7 (female guppies) + 5 (female goldfishes) = 12

Tate buys 2 male guppies, 1 female guppy, 2 male goldfishes, and 3 female goldfishes.

New total male fishes = 7 (initial male fishes) + 2 (new male guppies) + 2 (new male goldfishes) = 11
New total female fishes = 12 (initial female fishes) + 1 (new female guppy) + 3 (new female goldfishes) = 16

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of female fishes and male fishes.

Difference = New total female fishes - New total male fishes
Difference = 16 - 11
Difference = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time each person took to complete their chores and then add them together.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took more than 4 hours longer than Amalia, which means Dior took at least 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do the laundry.

Now, we add the time each person took to complete their chores: 4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours.

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance John drives in a round trip and then multiply it by the number of times he visits his parents in a month.

First, let's calculate the distance of a round trip. Since it takes John 2 hours to drive to his parents at a speed of 70 mph, we can use the formula:

Distance = Speed x Time

For one way, the distance is 70 mph x 2 hours = 140 miles. Since it's a round trip, we multiply this distance by 2:

Total distance for a round trip = 140 miles x 2 = 280 miles

Now, we know John visits his parents twice a month. To find the total distance he drives in a month, we multiply the round trip distance by the number of visits:

Total distance per month = 280 miles/round trip x 2 visits/month = 560 miles/month

The final answer is: 560"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we can multiply the number of miles she walks per day by the number of days:

10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

Sofie's distance = 2 * Brian's distance

We know that Sofie's distance is 70 miles, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

70 = 2 * Brian's distance

To find Brian's distance, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Brian's distance = 70 / 2
Brian's distance = 35 miles

Therefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

The final answer is: 35"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers and then determine how many toys the fifth worker must produce to meet the remaining demand.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour:

2 workers * 6 toys/hour * 10 hours = 120 toys

Next, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour:

2 workers * 4 toys/hour * 10 hours = 80 toys

Now, let's add the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers:

120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 toys to meet the order, the total number of toys needed is 400. We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

200 (toys produced by the first 4 workers) + x (toys produced by the fifth worker) = 400

To find the number of toys produced by the fifth worker, we can subtract 200 from both sides of the equation:

x = 400 - 200
x = 200

However, this is the total number of toys the fifth worker produces in 10 hours. To find the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we need to divide by 10:

x / 10 = 200 / 10
x = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the weights of Elijah's dogs and then add them to Kory's dog's weight.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so we can calculate its weight as follows:

Weight of Elijah's first dog = (1/4) * Weight of Kory's dog
= (1/4) * 60
= 15 pounds

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so we can calculate its weight as follows:

Weight of Elijah's second dog = (1/2) * Weight of Kory's dog
= (1/2) * 60
= 30 pounds

Now, we can find the total weight of Elijah's dogs by adding their weights:

Total weight of Elijah's dogs = Weight of Elijah's first dog + Weight of Elijah's second dog
= 15 + 30
= 45 pounds

To find the total weight of all three dogs, we add Kory's dog's weight to the total weight of Elijah's dogs:

Total weight of all dogs = Total weight of Elijah's dogs + Weight of Kory's dog
= 45 + 60
= 105 pounds

The final answer is: 105"
"To solve this problem, let's work backwards from the information given.

We know that Kris had 7 stickers left after giving some to Rob. Kris had 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob, so Kris must have had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers.

Before giving the stickers to Kris, Luis had 16 stickers. Since Luis gave the rest to Kris, Luis must have had 16 stickers before giving some to Kris. We know that Luis used half of the stickers he received from Seth, so Luis must have had twice as many stickers as he gave to Kris. Since Luis gave 16 stickers to Kris, Luis must have had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers.

Before giving the stickers to Luis, Seth had 32 stickers. Since Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, Seth must have had twice as many stickers as Luis. Therefore, Seth had 32 * 2 = 64 stickers in the beginning.

The final numerical answer is: 64"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of M&M's John has and then divide that by the number of M&M's he puts in each small bag.

First, let's find the total number of ounces of M&M's John has: 3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces.

Since an ounce of M&M's contains 30 M&M's, the total number of M&M's John has is: 30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's.

Now, we need to divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag: 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per small bag = 90 small bags.

The final answer is: 90"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance Alfie needs to fly to reach half the circumference of the Earth and then divide that distance by the distance Alfie flies each day.

The circumference of the Earth is 40,000 kilometers, so half of that is 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.

Since Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day, we can calculate the number of days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers by dividing the total distance by the daily distance:

20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half the way around the Earth.

50"
"To solve this problem, we can start by finding the speed of the 2nd fastest car. We know that the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, which goes 120 miles per hour. 

Speed of the 2nd fastest car = 5 * Speed of the average car
Speed of the 2nd fastest car = 5 * 120
Speed of the 2nd fastest car = 600 miles per hour

Now, we know that the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. 

Speed of the fastest car = 1.25 * Speed of the 2nd fastest car
Speed of the fastest car = 1.25 * 600
Speed of the fastest car = 750 miles per hour

The final answer is: 750"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic reasoning. Let's denote Vince's current age as 'V'. Two years ago, Liam's age was 16 - 2 = 14 years. According to the problem, two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. So, we can set up the equation: 14 = 2V.

To find Vince's current age, we need to solve for V. Divide both sides of the equation by 2: V = 14 / 2 = 7.

Vince's current age is 7 years.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S.

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so A = M.

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. This can be expressed as C + S = 30 and C = S + 12.

From the second equation, we can rewrite C as S + 12. Substituting this into the first equation, we get (S + 12) + S = 30.

Combining like terms, we get 2S + 12 = 30.

Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get 2S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 9.

Now that we know S, we can find C by substituting S into the equation C = S + 12. C = 9 + 12 = 21.

Since A = M, and the total number of eggs is 56, we can write the equation A + M + C + S = 56.

Substituting the values we know, we get A + A + 21 + 9 = 56.

Combining like terms, we get 2A + 30 = 56.

Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2A = 26.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get A = 13.

Now that we know A and C, we can find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold. C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weight of the crayons and the boxes. 

First, let's find the total weight of the crayons. Nik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. So, the total weight of the crayons is 200 * 1 = 200 ounces.

Since Nik wants to put the crayons into boxes, and each box weighs 8 ounces, we need to find out how many boxes he will need. To do this, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box, which is 8. 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Now, we need to find the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 25 boxes, the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is the sum of their individual weights, which is 200 (crayons) + 200 (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. To do this, we divide the total weight in ounces by 16. 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is: 25"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, we need to find out how many logs John can make from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we calculate 80% of 80 feet, which is 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet.

2. Since each log is 4 feet long, we divide the total length of the logs by the length of each log to find out how many logs he can make: 64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs.

3. From each log, he cuts 5 planks. So, the total number of planks he can make is 16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks.

4. He sells each plank for $1.2, so the total amount of money he makes is 80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96.

The final answer is: $96"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the monthly earnings of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of what her brother earns. Therefore, her brother's monthly earnings are 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so her monthly earnings are 2 * ($5000 + $10,000) = 2 * $15,000 = $30,000.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money they all have together by adding their individual monthly earnings: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine Grandma's speed on the beach and on the sidewalk. Let's denote her speed on the beach as 'x' miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, which covers 2 miles. So, we can set up the equation:

2 miles = 40 minutes * x miles/minute

To find x, we can divide both sides by 40:

x = 2 miles / 40 minutes
x = 0.05 miles/minute

Now that we know her speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk:

Speed on sidewalk = 2x = 2 * 0.05 miles/minute = 0.1 miles/minute

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 1 mile / 0.1 miles/minute = 10 minutes

Since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk, it takes her 10 minutes. Now, we need to find the total time it takes to complete the entire 3-mile walk. We already know that she spends 40 minutes on the beach. We also know that it takes her 10 minutes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk, so it will take her 10 minutes to walk the remaining 1 mile on the sidewalk.

Total time = Time on beach + Time on sidewalk
Total time = 40 minutes + 10 minutes + 10 minutes
Total time = 60 minutes

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Jane has saved so far and then determine how much more she needs to save to reach her goal of $60.

Jane has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved is:
$4/week * 8 weeks = $32

To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has saved from her goal:
$60 - $32 = $28

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the amount she needs to save by her weekly savings to find out how many more weeks it will take:
$28 / $4/week = 7 weeks

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of blue birds in each group of trees and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of blue birds in the 3 trees with 7 blue birds each:

3 trees * 7 blue birds/tree = 21 blue birds

Next, let's calculate the number of blue birds in the 2 trees with 4 blue birds each:

2 trees * 4 blue birds/tree = 8 blue birds

Finally, let's add the number of blue birds in the tree with 3 blue birds:

8 blue birds + 3 blue birds = 11 blue birds

Now, let's add the number of blue birds in the first group of trees to the number of blue birds in the other two trees:

21 blue birds + 8 blue birds + 11 blue birds = 40 blue birds

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the initial number of marbles Bob has. We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 24. 

Let's denote the initial number of marbles Bob has as 'x'. If he receives 24 more marbles, he will have x + 24 marbles. We are given that this sum equals 60. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 24 = 60

To find the initial number of marbles Bob has, we need to isolate 'x' by subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation:

x = 60 - 24
x = 36

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles. Now, we need to find out how many marbles he will have if he loses 10 marbles. To do this, we subtract 10 from the initial number of marbles:

36 - 10 = 26

Therefore, Bob will have 26 marbles.

The final answer is: 26"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the concept of thermal equilibrium and the principle of conservation of energy. When Donny pours water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle, the temperature of the water in the bottle will be a weighted average of the initial temperatures of the two mugs.

Let's denote the unknown temperature of the second mug as x. The initial temperature of the water in the bottle is 0 degrees (assuming it's empty initially). After pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the x-degree mug, the total volume of water in the bottle becomes 5 ounces.

The heat energy transferred from the 33-degree mug is proportional to its temperature and the volume of water poured. Similarly, the heat energy transferred from the x-degree mug is proportional to its temperature and the volume of water poured. Since the water in the bottle is now at a temperature that allows Donny to drink it, we can assume that the final temperature of the water in the bottle is at least 40 degrees.

We can set up an equation based on the principle of conservation of energy:

(33 * 4) + (x * 1) = (40 * 5)

Simplifying the equation:

132 + x = 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x = 68

Therefore, the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of cows and chickens on the farm after three weeks.

First, let's calculate the number of cows. Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 21 days in three weeks. 

The total number of cows brought by Milkie Cows Limited in three weeks is 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows.

The total number of cows on the farm after three weeks is 50 (initial cows) + 420 (cows brought by Milkie Cows Limited) = 470 cows.

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens. Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. The total number of chickens brought by Broilers Limited in three weeks is 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.

The total number of chickens on the farm after three weeks is 20 (initial chickens) + 210 (chickens brought by Broilers Limited) = 230 chickens.

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is the sum of the total number of cows and chickens, which is 470 (cows) + 230 (chickens) = 700.

"To determine the cost of each single bagel, we need to calculate the total cost of the bagels after the discount and then divide it by the total number of bagels.

First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount: 4 packs * $10.00 per pack = $40.00.

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to calculate the discount amount: 10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since each pack contains 9 bagels, the total number of bagels is 4 packs * 9 bagels per pack = 36 bagels.

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the total cost after the discount by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops, so we can write this as:

Gomer's scoops = 23 - 5
Gomer's scoops = 18

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make one scoop of mashed potatoes. We are told that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops. Let's write this as an equation:

Let x be the number of potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes.
Then, it takes x + 3 potatoes to make 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.

We are also told that it takes x + 3 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops, which is 2 scoops. So, we can write the equation as:

x + 3 = 2 * (number of potatoes to make 1 scoop)
x + 3 = 2x

Now, we can solve for x:

x + 3 = 2x
3 = 2x - x
3 = x

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes.

Now that we know it takes 3 potatoes to make 1 scoop, we can find out how many potatoes Gomer ate. We know Gomer ate 18 scoops, so we can multiply the number of scoops by the number of potatoes per scoop:

Potatoes eaten by Gomer = 18 * 3
Potatoes eaten by Gomer = 54

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days, and then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days is 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days is 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

The total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days is 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens. 

240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen eggs.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of red jellybeans, since we know that there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans. 

Let's denote the number of green jellybeans as G, the number of red jellybeans as R, and the number of blue jellybeans as B. We are given that G = 17 and R = 2G. 

Since there are a total of 60 jellybeans, we can write the equation: G + R + B = 60. 

Substituting the values we know, we get 17 + 2(17) + B = 60. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 17 + 34 + B = 60. 

Combining like terms, we get 51 + B = 60. 

Subtracting 51 from both sides, we get B = 9.

Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is 9.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of lemons Tim collects in a decade. 

First, let's calculate the number of lemons Tim collects in a year. Since he has 5 trees and each tree yields 6 lemons per year, the total number of lemons collected in a year is 5 * 6 = 30.

Next, we need to calculate the number of years in a decade. A decade consists of 10 years.

Now, we can calculate the total number of lemons collected in a decade by multiplying the number of lemons collected in a year by the number of years in a decade: 30 * 10 = 300.

Therefore, Tim collects 300 lemons in a decade.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of men and women on the bus. 

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can let the number of men be 5x and the number of women be 9x. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the equation: 5x + 9x = 84.

Combine like terms: 14x = 84.

Divide both sides by 14: x = 6.

Now that we know x, we can find the number of women on the bus: 9x = 9(6) = 54.

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining is: 54 - 20 = 34.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many sunflowers Faraday sold per day. We know that he earned $26 from the sunflowers and $56 from the bouquets per day. Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers sold per day can be found by adding the number of sunflowers sold as individual flowers and the number of sunflowers sold in bouquets.

Let's denote the number of individual sunflowers sold per day as 'x'. Then, the number of bouquets sold per day is 56 / 8 = 7. Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold in bouquets per day is 7 * 12 = 84.

The total number of sunflowers sold per day is the sum of individual sunflowers and sunflowers in bouquets: x + 84.

We also know that the total earnings from sunflowers per day is $26. Since each sunflower costs $2, the number of sunflowers sold per day is 26 / 2 = 13.

Now we have two equations: x + 84 = 13 and x = 13. However, the first equation is incorrect because it is not possible to sell a negative number of sunflowers. The correct equation is x = 13.

However, we need to find the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days. So, we multiply the number of sunflowers sold per day by 3: 13 * 3 = 39.

The final answer is: 39"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the inventory, the revenue from selling 60% of the inventory, and then find the difference between the revenue and the cost.

First, let's find out how many rocks Adam can buy with $100. Since each rock costs $5, the total number of rocks he can buy is:

100 / 5 = 20 rocks

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling 60% of the inventory. Since he sells 60% of 20 rocks, he sells 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks. Each rock is sold for $7, so the total revenue is:

12 * 7 = $84

Now, let's calculate the cost of the inventory. Since Adam buys 20 rocks at $5 each, the total cost is:

20 * 5 = $100

However, since he only sells 60% of the inventory, he still has 40% of the rocks left, which he hasn't sold. The cost of these unsold rocks is:

0.4 * 20 * 5 = $8

The total cost of the inventory is the cost of the sold rocks plus the cost of the unsold rocks:

$100 + $8 = $108

Now, let's find the difference between the revenue and the cost:

$108 - $84 = $24

Adam loses $24.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene. 

Let's first find the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene:

- Large-sized picture scenes: 45 / 5 = 9 days
- Medium-sized picture scenes: 36 / 6 = 6 days
- Small-sized picture scenes: 49 / 7 = 7 days

Now, we need to find the LCM of 9, 6, and 7. 

The prime factorization of 6 is 2 * 3.
The prime factorization of 7 is 7.
The prime factorization of 9 is 3^2.

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:
- The highest power of 2 is 2^1 (from 6).
- The highest power of 3 is 3^2 (from 9).
- The highest power of 7 is 7^1 (from 7).

The LCM is 2^1 * 3^2 * 7^1 = 2 * 9 * 7 = 126.

Therefore, it will take Lauren 126 days to complete all the picture scenes.

"To determine how much Jen spends on food for her fish in the month of May, we need to calculate the total cost of food for the fish for the entire month.

First, we need to determine the number of days in May. May has 31 days.

Next, we need to calculate the daily cost of food for the fish. Each fish needs $1 worth of food per day, and Jen has 3 fish, so the total daily cost is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, we can calculate the total cost for the month of May by multiplying the daily cost by the number of days in May: $3 * 31 = $93.

Therefore, Jen spends $93 on food for her fish in the month of May.

$93"
"This question can be approached through a simple arithmetic operation, which is a fundamental concept in mathematics. However, it also touches upon the idea of change and the concept of possession, which can be related to the philosophical concept of ontology - the branch of philosophy that deals with the nature of existence.

In this scenario, Patricia's roses can be seen as a collection of objects that exist in the world. When she gives some away, she is changing the quantity of roses she possesses. When she buys more, she is increasing the quantity of roses she possesses.

To solve the problem, we can use the following steps:

1. Patricia starts with 30 roses.
2. She gives away 24 roses, so we subtract 24 from 30: 30 - 24 = 6.
3. Then, she buys 15 more roses, so we add 15 to 6: 6 + 15 = 21.

Therefore, Patricia now has 21 roses.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken. 

The total distance traveled is the sum of the two distances: 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles.

The total time taken is the sum of the two times: 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

The average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time: 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of both tickets winning. Let's denote the probability of the first ticket winning as P(A) = 20% or 0.2, and the probability of the second ticket winning as P(B) = 3 * P(A) = 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

The probability of both tickets winning is the product of their individual probabilities, since the events are independent. Therefore, the probability of both tickets winning is P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of seashells each person collected. 

Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as x. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, Carlos collected 2x seashells. We are given that Jim collected 5 more than Carlos, so Jim collected 2x + 5 seashells.

We know that the total number of seashells collected is the sum of the seashells collected by each person: x + 2x + (2x + 5) = 5x + 5.

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, the total number of seashells must be divisible by 3. We can set up an equation to find the value of x:

5x + 5 = 3y, where y is the number of seashells each person gets.

However, we can also express the total number of seashells as the sum of the seashells collected by each person: x + 2x + (2x + 5) = 5x + 5. Since they divided the seashells equally, we can set up the equation (5x + 5)/3 = y.

To find the value of x, we can set up the equation 5x + 5 = 3y and solve for x. However, we can also use the fact that the total number of seashells is 27 + 5 = 32. Since they divided the seashells equally, we can set up the equation (27 + 2x + (2x + 5))/3 = y.

Simplifying the equation, we get (27 + 4x + 5)/3 = y. We know that the total number of seashells is 32, so we can set up the equation (32)/3 = y.

However, we can also express the total number of seashells as the sum of the seashells collected by each person: 27 + (2x + 5) + x = 32. Simplifying the equation, we get 3x + 32 = 32.

Subtracting 32 from both sides, we get 3x = 0. Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 0. However, this is not possible since x represents the number of seashells Carrey collected.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of carrots Mason eats on weekdays and then add the number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday), so the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day, so the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 + 5 = 10.

To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we add the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the number of carrots he eats on the weekend: 20 + 10 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song and then add it to the length of the first song.

The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find 60% of 5 minutes, we multiply 5 by 0.6, which is 3 minutes. 

So, the second song is 5 + 3 = 8 minutes long.

Now, we add the lengths of both songs to find the total time of the cassette: 5 + 8 = 13 minutes.

The final answer is: 13"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total profit Linus earned from selling the mobile devices he bought on Monday and Tuesday.

First, let's calculate the profit from selling the devices bought on Monday. Since he bought 2 devices and sold each for twice the original price, the selling price of each device is $20 * 2 = $40. The profit from each device is $40 - $20 = $20. Since he bought 2 devices, the total profit from Monday's devices is 2 * $20 = $40.

Next, let's calculate the profit from selling the devices bought on Tuesday. He bought 4 devices and sold each for twice the original price, so the selling price of each device is $20 * 2 = $40. The profit from each device is $40 - $20 = $20. Since he bought 4 devices, the total profit from Tuesday's devices is 4 * $20 = $80.

Now, let's add the profits from Monday and Tuesday to find the total profit: $40 + $80 = $120.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of bottles required to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, and then subtract the number of bottles Hortex can currently produce.

First, let's calculate the total number of bottles required to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people. Since each bottle covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand, we need to find out how many bottles are required to cover 100% of the energy demand of 2300 people.

100% of the energy demand of one person is covered by 1 / 0.2 = 5 bottles.

To cover 100% of the energy demand of 2300 people, we need 5 * 2300 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles they need to produce to reach 11500 bottles.

The number of additional bottles required is 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

The final answer is: 7300"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's determine the number of babies wearing purple and blue. Since Carla has 8 identical octuplets, 3/4 of them wear purple, and 1/4 wear blue. 

Number of purple-wearers = 8 * (3/4) = 6
Number of blue-wearers = 8 * (1/4) = 2

Next, we need to find out how many of the purple-wearers also wear bows. 1/3 of the purple-wearers wear bows.

Number of purple-wearers with bows = 6 * (1/3) = 2

Now, we need to find the total number of babies wearing bows. This includes all the blue-wearers and the purple-wearers with bows.

Total number of babies wearing bows = Number of blue-wearers + Number of purple-wearers with bows = 2 + 2 = 4

To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to divide the number of purple-wearers with bows by the total number of babies wearing bows and multiply by 100.

Percentage chance = (Number of purple-wearers with bows / Total number of babies wearing bows) * 100
= (2 / 4) * 100

"To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday, and then subtract that result from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports received last week = 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

First, let's find the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday. 

Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Now, let's find the total number of reports received on Wednesday by subtracting the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday. However, we need to subtract the reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total reports received last week to get the reports received on Wednesday.

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received last week - (Reports received on Monday and Tuesday + Reports received on Thursday and Friday)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Reports received on Wednesday = 1125

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Abraham owns 80 square meters of land. 

1. He sold half of the land for $50. Since half of 80 is 40, he sold 40 square meters for $50. 

2. Now, he has 80 - 40 = 40 square meters left. He sold 1/4 of this remaining land for $30. Since 1/4 of 40 is 10, he sold 10 square meters for $30.

3. Now, he has 40 - 10 = 30 square meters left. He sold this remaining land for $3 per square meter.

The total amount earned from selling the remaining 30 square meters is 30 * $3 = $90.

Now, let's calculate the total amount earned from the first two sales. He sold 40 square meters for $50 and 10 square meters for $30. The total amount earned from these sales is $50 + $30 = $80.

The total amount earned from all the sales is $80 + $90 = $170.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, we know that Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. Since a dozen is 12, 3 dozen is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs, Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by each person: 5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs.

To find out how many eggs are still hidden, we subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of apartments in each complex and then determine the total amount John earns per week.

First, let's find the total number of apartments in the first two complexes: 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400. 

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. 

So, the last complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, let's find the total number of apartments in all three complexes: 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so he collects from 1040 * 3 = 3120 apartments per week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * $0.40 = $1248.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree over its 10-year lifespan.

In the first year, the tree produces 0 fruits (since it's a 5-year-old tree at the beginning of the year, but the question asks for the total fruits produced over 10 years, and the first year is when the tree is 5 years old).

In the second year, the tree is 6 years old and produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.

In the third year, the tree is 7 years old and produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.

In the fourth year, the tree is 8 years old and produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits. So, an 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

In the fifth year, the tree is 9 years old and produces 0 fruits (since it's the ninth year of its life).

In the sixth year, the tree is 10 years old and produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree over its 10-year lifespan:

Year 8: 50 * 3 = 150 fruits
Year 9: 0 fruits
Year 10: 50 * 20 = 1000 fruits

Total fruits = 0 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 + 350 + 150 + 0 + 1000 = 3100

The final answer is: 3100"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of fractions and addition. Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100, which is equivalent to (1/5) * 100 = $20. 

Now, we need to add this amount to Jack's initial $100. 

Jack's new amount = Initial amount + Amount received from Sophia
= $100 + $20
= $120

Therefore, Jack now has $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the blue rope as x. Since the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, the length of the yellow rope is x + 7. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so its length is 4x.

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation:

x + (x + 7) + 4x = 37

Combine like terms:

6x + 7 = 37

Subtract 7 from both sides:

6x = 30

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 5

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope:

Length of the red rope = 4x = 4(5) = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of money Ronnie was given as R and the amount of money Rissa was given as 3R (since she was given thrice as much as Ronnie).

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Ronnie is left with R - x and Rissa is left with 3R - x, where x is the amount they both gave to their sister.

According to the problem, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money, so we can set up the equation:

3R - x = (4/5)(3R)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3R - x = 12R/5

Multiplying both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

15R - 5x = 12R

Subtracting 12R from both sides, we get:

3R - 5x = 0

Now, let's express x in terms of R:

5x = 3R

x = 3R/5

Now, let's go back to Ronnie's money. We know that Ronnie is left with R - x, so we can substitute the value of x:

R - x = R - 3R/5

Simplifying the expression, we get:

R - 3R/5 = (5R - 3R)/5

= 2R/5

So, Ronnie is left with 2R/5 of his original money.

Since Ronnie was given $5, we can substitute R = 5 into the expression:

2R/5 = 2(5)/5

= 10/5

= 2

Therefore, Ronnie is left with $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as R, W, and P respectively. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can say R = W = P.

We are given that half the mural is yellow, which means the other half is painted with red, white, and purple. Since the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half of it is yellow, the other half is 6 pints (12 / 2 = 6).

Since the other half is painted with red, white, and purple, and there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, we can say that R + W + P = 6.

We also know that R = W = P, so we can substitute W and P with R in the equation: R + R + R = 6.

Combine like terms: 3R = 6.

Divide both sides by 3: R = 2.

Therefore, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the area of each room and then sum them up. 

First, let's find the area of one bedroom: 
Area of one bedroom = length * width = 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, its area is:
Area of living room = 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

Now, we know that there are 4 bedrooms, so the total area of all bedrooms is:
Area of all bedrooms = 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

We are given that the rest of the house (excluding the bedrooms and living room) is 1000 square feet.

The total area of the house is the sum of the areas of all rooms:
Total area = Area of all bedrooms + Area of living room + Area of the rest of the house
Total area = 960 + 1200 + 1000
Total area = 3160 square feet.

The final answer is: 3160"
"This problem can be approached using geometric progression, a concept in mathematics that deals with sequences of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio.

In this scenario, the number of clouds Alice counts each day forms a geometric sequence: 3, 6, 12, 24, 48. 

To find the total number of clouds counted across all five days, we need to sum this sequence. The sum of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula: S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where S is the sum, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

Here, a = 3, r = 2, and n = 5. 

Plugging these values into the formula, we get: S = 3 * (1 - 2^5) / (1 - 2) = 3 * (1 - 32) / (-1) = 3 * (-31) / (-1) = 3 * 31 = 93.

Therefore, the total number of clouds Alice will have counted in the sky at lunch across all five days is 93.

The final answer is: 93"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of pods in the new box. Since the new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, we can calculate the number of pods in the new box as follows:

Number of pods in the regular box = 100
Increase in the number of pods = 20% of 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20
Number of pods in the new box = 100 + 20 = 120

Now, we know that the new box costs $12 and has 120 pods. To find out how many dishwashing cycles we can run for $1, we need to divide the number of pods in the new box by the cost of the new box and then divide the result by the number of pods used per cycle.

Number of cycles per dollar = Number of pods in the new box / Cost of the new box
= 120 / 12
= 10

Since we use 1 pod per cycle, the number of cycles we can run for $1 is equal to the number of cycles per dollar.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. This means he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he is left with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which means he uses 40 / 2 = 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, tripling his money means each bill is now worth $60. So, he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills, but each is worth $60.

5. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we need to find out the total amount of money he has and divide it by 5. Since each bill is worth $60, the total amount of money is 60 * 60 = 3600 dollars. 

3600 / 5 = 720."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals.

Now, we know that in the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Since team B scored 8 goals in the second half, team A scores 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals in the second half.

The total number of goals scored by team A is 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals. The total number of goals scored by team B is 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many days the teacher can use the chalk before it gets too small. 

Let's start by finding out how much chalk the teacher used on Monday. Since he used 45% of the 5-inch chalk, we can calculate the amount used as follows:

45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

This means the teacher has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk left.

Now, we need to find out how many days the teacher can use the chalk at a rate of 20% per day. We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

Initial chalk length - (chalk used per day * number of days) = 2 inches (since the teacher recycles the chalk when it's smaller than 2 inches)

Let's plug in the values we know:

2.75 - (0.20 * number of days) = 2

Now, we can solve for the number of days:

0.20 * number of days = 2.75 - 2
0.20 * number of days = 0.75
number of days = 0.75 / 0.20
number of days = 3.75

Since the teacher can't use a fraction of a day, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can use the full 3.75 days because the teacher will still have chalk left after 3 days, but it will be too small to use on the 4th day.

The final answer is: 3"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of students on varsity and then subtract that from the total number of students in the class.

First, let's find the number of girls on varsity. One-third of the girls are on varsity, and there are 12 girls in the class. 

Number of girls on varsity = (1/3) * 12 = 4

Next, let's find the number of boys on varsity. One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, and there are 12 boys in the class.

Number of boys on varsity = (1/4) * 12 = 3

Now, let's find the total number of students on varsity by adding the number of girls and boys on varsity.

Total number of students on varsity = 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7

Finally, let's find the number of students not on varsity by subtracting the total number of students on varsity from the total number of students in the class.

Total number of students in the class = 12 (boys) + 12 (girls) = 24

Number of students not on varsity = 24 - 7 = 17

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of face masks Mike bought, which is given as 5. 

Next, we need to calculate the number of face masks Johnny bought, which is 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. 

Thrice as many as Mike means 3 times the number of face masks Mike bought, which is 3 * 5 = 15. 

2 more than thrice as many as Mike means we add 2 to 15, which is 15 + 2 = 17.

Therefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of teeth the dentist fixes, which includes both the teeth drilled and capped. 

The dentist drills 4 teeth. 
The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so the number of teeth capped is 4 + 7 = 11.

The total number of teeth fixed by the dentist is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15.

James has 30 teeth initially. The dentist fixes 15 teeth, so the percentage of teeth fixed is (15 / 30) * 100.

To calculate this, we can simplify the fraction 15/30 to 1/2, and then multiply by 100 to get 50%.

2/5 * 4000 = (2 * 4000) / 5 = 8000 / 5 = 1600 gallons

Since Mr. Marcellus was charged $3.5 per gallon, the total amount he would be refunded for the expired milk is:

1600 * $3.5 = $5600

Therefore, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5600."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Colin's current age as C and Wendy's current age as W.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be expressed as:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be expressed as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:

C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:

20 = C

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of books Bob can buy with $27,000. Since he can buy 100 books for $500, we can find the total number of books by dividing the total amount spent by the cost per 100 books.

Total amount spent: $27,000
Cost per 100 books: $500

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost per 100 books
Total number of books = $27,000 / $500
Total number of books = 54

Since Bob is distributing the books among 3 schools, we need to divide the total number of books by 3 to find the number of books per school.

Number of books per school = Total number of books / 3
Number of books per school = 54 / 3
Number of books per school = 18

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, two apples fell out of the tree. One landed on Newton's head, and the other was thrown back into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. This means there are now 2 (initial apples) + 5 (new apples) = 7 apples.

Newton picked up all but one of these 7 apples, leaving 1 apple behind. He then threw the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. This means there are now 7 (previous apples) + 6 (new apples) = 13 apples.

Newton picked up all of the remaining apples, which are the 13 apples that fell out of the tree after the second apple was thrown.

Therefore, Newton brought home 13 apples.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza that Kate's friends will eat, and then determine the total number of slices needed. 

First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten: 6 friends * 6 slices per friend = 36 slices. 

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten: 6 friends * 4 slices per friend = 24 slices.

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to determine how many whole pizzas of each type Kate needs to buy. 

For the cheese pizza, we need to divide the total number of slices eaten (36) by the number of slices per pizza (12): 36 / 12 = 3. This means Kate needs 3 whole cheese pizzas.

For the pepperoni pizza, we need to divide the total number of slices eaten (24) by the number of slices per pizza (8): 24 / 8 = 3. This means Kate needs 3 whole pepperoni pizzas.

Therefore, Kate needs to buy a total of 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

"To determine the total number of miles Sam ran this week, we need to calculate the total miles run on each day and then sum them up.

On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. Since there are 3 days, the total miles run on these days is 3 * 3 = 9 miles.

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. Since there are 2 days, the total miles run on these days is 5 * 2 = 10 miles.

Now, we add the total miles run on both sets of days: 9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles.

Therefore, Sam ran a total of 19 miles this week.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the rate at which Jay builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 20/60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute. 

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, which is equivalent to 2/(15/60) = 4/3 snowballs per hour. 

To find the net rate at which Jay gains snowballs, we subtract the rate at which they melt from the rate at which he builds them: 1/3 - 4/3 = -1 snowball per hour. 

This means that Jay is losing 1 snowball per hour due to melting. 

Since Jay starts with 0 snowballs, he will be at a net loss of 1 snowball per hour. To have 60 snowballs, he needs to be at a net gain of 60 snowballs. 

Since he loses 1 snowball per hour, he needs to build 61 snowballs to have 60 snowballs after accounting for the melting. 

To build 61 snowballs, Jay will need 61/1 = 61 hours.

The final answer is: 61"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the age relationship between John and Jim at the time Digimon was released. Let's denote the age of Jim at that time as 'x'. Since John was twice as old as Jim, John's age at that time would be '2x'.

We know that 20 years have passed since Digimon was released, and John is now 28 years old. This means that 20 years ago, John was 28 - 20 = 8 years old. Since John was 2x years old at that time, we can set up the equation 2x = 8.

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2, resulting in x = 4. This means that Jim was 4 years old when Digimon was released.

Since 20 years have passed, Jim's current age would be 4 + 20 = 24.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the remaining bandages after the first day are x - 38 + 50.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The remaining bandages after the second day are (x - 38 + 50) - 28.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages (2 * 50 = 100) and used half a pack (50 / 2 = 25 bandages). The remaining bandages after the third day are ((x - 38 + 50) - 28) - 25 + 100.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation:

(x - 38 + 50) - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78

Simplifying the equation:

x - 38 + 50 - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78
x + 57 = 78

Subtracting 57 from both sides:

x = 21

"To determine Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her regular earnings and her attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular earnings. Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. Since there are 4 weeks in April, we need to calculate the total number of working hours in April. 

There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of working days in April is 4 weeks * 6 days/week = 24 days. 

Jen's total working hours in April are 24 days * 7.5 hours/day = 180 hours.

Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her regular earnings are 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270.

Jen also receives an additional $10 for complete attendance. Since she did not incur any absences for the entire month, she is eligible for the attendance bonus. 

Her total earnings for April are $270 (regular earnings) + $10 (attendance bonus) = $280.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of red pens and black pens Alain's mom bought. 

First, we know that Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack has 5 pens. So, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

Next, we are told that Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. Since she bought 25 red pens, she bought 2 * 25 = 50 black pens.

To find the total number of pens Alain has, we need to add the number of red pens and black pens together: 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the cost of one bottle of scotch. Since John buys 10 bottles for $600, we can divide the total cost by the number of bottles to find the cost of one bottle:

Cost of one bottle of scotch = Total cost / Number of bottles
= $600 / 10
= $60

Now, let's find the cost of one bottle of cognac. It's given that the cognac costs 50% more than the scotch. To find the cost of one bottle of cognac, we need to calculate 50% of the cost of one bottle of scotch and add it to the cost of one bottle of scotch:

50% of $60 = 0.5 * $60 = $30
Cost of one bottle of cognac = Cost of one bottle of scotch + 50% of the cost of one bottle of scotch
= $60 + $30
= $90

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, and he buys 10 bottles of scotch, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

Now, let's find the total cost of the cognac:

Total cost of cognac = Number of bottles of cognac * Cost of one bottle of cognac
= 20 * $90
= $1800

Finally, let's find the total amount John spends on everything:

Total amount spent = Total cost of scotch + Total cost of cognac

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's determine the number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day. Since Mr. Julius planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, and he planted 20 White Oak trees, he planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so the total number of White Oak trees planted is 20 + 10 = 30.

For the Lodgepole Pine trees, he planted 1/4 more than the first day, which is 1/4 of 40, or 10. So, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted in the two days. The total number of White Oak trees is 20 + 10 = 30, and the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees is 40 + 50 = 90.

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 30 + 90 = 120.

"To solve this problem, we can translate the given statement into a mathematical equation. Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as 'x'. The statement ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8. We are told that this expression equals 40.

So, we have the equation: 4x + 8 = 40

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable 'x'. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for 'x':

4x / 4 = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of fish with red stripes and then the number of fish with blue stripes. 

One-third of the fish have red stripes, so the number of fish with red stripes is 66 / 3 = 22.

The remaining fish are 66 - 22 = 44.

5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, so the number of fish with blue stripes is (5/11) * 44 = 20.

Now, we need to find the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes. However, we have counted the fish with both red and blue stripes twice. To avoid double-counting, we need to subtract the number of fish with both red and blue stripes. Unfortunately, we don't have information about the number of fish with both red and blue stripes.

However, we can still find the total number of fish with red stripes or blue stripes. The number of fish with red stripes is 22, and the number of fish with blue stripes is 20. To find the total number of fish with red stripes or blue stripes, we add these two numbers: 22 + 20 = 42.

Since we don't have information about the number of fish with both red and blue stripes, we can't find the exact number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes. However, we can say that the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is less than or equal to 42.

However, if we assume that there are no fish with both red and blue stripes, then the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is 42.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Amy had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so she had a total of 2 * 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors from the palettes.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 eyeshadow colors each, so she had a total of 3 * 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister stole one of the palettes, which means Amy lost 4 eyeshadow colors (since each palette has 4 colors).

Now, Amy has 26 - 4 = 22 eyeshadow colors left.

Amy then uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set has 6 eyeshadow colors, half of that is 6 / 2 = 3 eyeshadow colors.

So, Amy uses up 3 eyeshadow colors from one makeup set.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

The final answer is: 19"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Mattison's height is 60 inches.
2. The two-story house is 7 times as high as Mattison, so the total height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.
3. The first floor's floor to ceiling height is three times Mattison's height, so it is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.
4. Since the total height of the house is 420 inches and the first floor's height is 180 inches, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.
5. To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the second floor from the total height of the house. However, we are not given the height of the second floor to the ceiling. We are only given the height of the second floor. Since the problem asks for the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we can assume that the height of the second floor to the ceiling is the same as the height of the first floor to the ceiling, which is 180 inches. Therefore, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 180 inches.

The final answer is: 180"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many shells team Alphas found. Since they found 40% of the total 700 shells, we can calculate this as follows:

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells

Now, we know that team Alphas found 280 shells. This means that 700 - 280 = 420 shells are left.

Next, team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells. We can calculate this as follows:

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells

Now, we know that team The finders found 252 shells. This means that 420 - 252 = 168 shells are left for team Gogetters.

Therefore, team Gogetters found 168 shells.

The final answer is: 168"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of exercise required for all four dogs and then subtract the total amount of exercise required for the first three dogs. 

Let's denote the amount of exercise the last dog needs as x. The total amount of exercise required for all four dogs is 3 miles per dog, and there are 4 dogs, so the total amount of exercise required is 3 * 4 = 12 miles.

The first dog needs 1 mile, the second dog needs 4 miles, and the third dog needs 3 miles. So, the total amount of exercise required for the first three dogs is 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

Now, we can set up an equation to find the amount of exercise the last dog needs: 8 + x = 12.

To solve for x, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: x = 12 - 8.

x = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. John's house is worth $250,000. He gets a loan worth 40% of that, which is 0.4 * $250,000 = $100,000.

2. He uses 60% of the loan to pay off his debts. 60% of $100,000 is 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000.

3. Since he used $60,000 to pay off his debts, he has $100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000 leftover.

"To determine the total amount Deandre will earn from selling the tunas, we need to calculate the total weight of the tunas and then multiply it by the price per kilogram.

The total weight of the tunas is the sum of their individual weights: 
56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg

Since each kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we multiply the total weight by the price per kilogram:
128 kg * $0.50/kg = $64

Therefore, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market.

The final answer is: $64"
"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first determine the selling price of the magazines. Since she sells them at 11/8 of the price she bought them, we can calculate the selling price as follows:

Selling price = (11/8) * Cost price
Cost price = $72
Selling price = (11/8) * 72
Selling price = 11 * 9
Selling price = 99

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:

Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

The final answer is: $27"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water removed by each setting and then sum them up.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total water removed by the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total water removed by the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total water removed by the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, we sum up the water removed by each setting: 3 (low) + 6 (medium) + 20 (high) = 29 liters.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of balloons Jolene and her friends had initially. Since they filled up 10 packs of balloons with 30 balloons per pack, we can calculate the total number of balloons as follows:

Total number of balloons = Number of packs * Number of balloons per pack
Total number of balloons = 10 * 30
Total number of balloons = 300

Since 12 balloons were left by the end of the afternoon, we can find the number of balloons thrown by subtracting the remaining balloons from the total number of balloons:

Number of balloons thrown = Total number of balloons - Remaining balloons
Number of balloons thrown = 300 - 12
Number of balloons thrown = 288

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the amount of each medicine in one dose. 

Let's denote the amount of the first medicine as M1 and the amount of the second medicine as M2. We are given that M1 = 14 mL. We are also given that M2 is 3 times the amount of M1, so M2 = 3 * M1 = 3 * 14 = 42 mL.

Now, we need to find the total amount of medicine in one dose. This is the sum of M1 and M2, which is 14 + 42 = 56 mL.

To find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we multiply the amount of medicine in one dose by 8. So, 56 * 8 = 448 mL.

"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we first need to determine the capacity of John's school. 

Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class has 120 students, we can find the capacity of one of John's classes by multiplying 120 by 1/8.

Capacity of one of John's classes = 120 * (1/8) = 15 students

Since John has two classes, we multiply the capacity of one class by 2 to find the total capacity of John's school.

Capacity of John's school = 15 * 2 = 30 students

Now, we add the capacity of Ali's school (which is 120 students) to the capacity of John's school to find the combined capacity of both schools.

Combined capacity = 120 + 30 = 150

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total interest Stephen owes his sister and then subtract the total amount he has paid in the 11 months from the total amount he borrowed plus the interest.

First, let's calculate the total interest Stephen owes his sister. The interest is 2% of the $300 he borrowed, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

Now, let's calculate the total amount Stephen will pay in the 12 months. In the first 11 months, he will pay $25 per month, so the total amount he will pay in these 11 months is 11 * 25 = $275.

The total amount Stephen will pay in the 12th month is the sum of the amount he borrowed plus the interest, minus the total amount he has paid in the 11 months. This is 300 + 6 - 275 = 31.

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to calculate the actual number of red jelly beans in the jar and then compare it to his estimated number.

First, let's calculate the volume of the jar. The jar has a square base with a side length of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the jar) is calculated as length * width * height. Since the base is square, the length and width are the same.

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, we need to calculate the actual volume available for the jelly beans. 

Available volume = Total volume * Efficiency
Available volume = 540 * 0.8
Available volume = 432 cubic inches

Now, we know that each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches. To find the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the available volume, we divide the available volume by the volume of a single jelly bean.

Total jelly beans = Available volume / Volume of a jelly bean
Total jelly beans = 432 / 0.15
Total jelly beans = 2880

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can calculate the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3.

Number of red jelly beans = Total jelly beans * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 864

However, we are given that the true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900. To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we need to know his estimated number of red jelly beans. Unfortunately, we don't have that information. 

However, we can calculate the percentage difference between the true number of red jelly beans and the estimated number. If we assume the estimated number is x, we can use the formula:

Percentage difference = ((Estimated - True) / True) * 100

We can plug in the values we have:

Percentage difference = ((x - 900) / 900) * 100

To find the actual difference, we need the estimated number of red jelly beans."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. 

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 of 40 is (3/4) * 40 = 30. So, 30 people entered the bus at the second stop. The total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the remaining spaces, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the cost of the visits before the price increase and the cost of the visits after the price increase.

Initially, Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year. In 5 years, she would have visited the museum 3 * 5 = 15 times. The cost of one visit is $2, so the total cost for the first 5 years is 15 * 2 = $30.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit increases by 150%. This means the new cost of one visit is 2 + (2 * 1.5) = $5. Since Pauline continues to visit the museum 3 times a year for the next 3 years, she visits the museum 3 * 3 = 9 more times. The total cost for the next 3 years is 9 * 5 = $45.

The total cost for all visits to the museum is the sum of the cost for the first 5 years and the cost for the next 3 years: 30 + 45 = $75.

The final numerical answer is: $75"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of students and the number of groups that can be formed. 

There are 4 grades with 10 students in each grade, so the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40.

Since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we need to divide the total number of students by 8 to find the number of groups. 

40 / 8 = 5

This means that 5 groups of 8 students each will be formed. 

Since each group uses their full 45 minutes, the time it takes for everyone to try the escape room is the number of groups multiplied by the time per group.

5 * 45 = 225 minutes

Therefore, it will take 225 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

"To determine the total amount Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the cost of the wooden tables and the roof frames separately and then add them together.

The cost of the wooden tables is 4 tables * $20 per table = $80.

The cost of the roof frames is 2 frames * $10 per frame = $20.

The total amount Ali has to pay John is $80 + $20 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length can be represented as 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet. We can write this as an equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x = 8), we can find the length of the longer piece by multiplying x by 4:

4x = 4(8) = 32

So, the longer piece is 32 feet long.

The final answer is: 32"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of ground beef Aiden needs to make 80 meatballs and then calculate the amount of seasoning required.

Since Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, to make 80 meatballs, he will need:

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs/pound = 5 pounds of ground beef

Since Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef, he will need:

5 pounds of ground beef * 2 tablespoons/pound = 10 tablespoons of seasoning

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning to make 80 meatballs.

"To determine the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the width of one window by the total number of windows. 

Width of one window = 35 inches
Number of windows = 5

Total width of windows = Width of one window * Number of windows
Total width of windows = 35 * 5
Total width of windows = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the total width by 2.

Fabric needed = 2 * Total width of windows
Fabric needed = 2 * 175
Fabric needed = 350 inches

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the cost of the first 16 minutes and the cost of the remaining minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute, so the total cost for the first 16 minutes is:
16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

For the remaining 20 minutes (36 minutes - 16 minutes), the cost is $0.2 per minute, so the total cost for the remaining minutes is:
20 minutes * $0.2/minute = $4.00

The total cost of the 36-minute call is the sum of the cost of the first 16 minutes and the cost of the remaining 20 minutes:
$4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of rain expected on Tuesday. 

First, let's find out how much rain fell on Monday, which is given as 2 inches. 

Next, we need to calculate twice the total amount of rain that fell on Monday. Twice of 2 inches is 2 * 2 = 4 inches.

Now, we are told that it is expected to rain 1 more inch than twice of Monday's total on Tuesday. So, we need to add 1 inch to the twice of Monday's total, which is 4 inches. 

4 + 1 = 5 inches.

Therefore, the amount of rain expected on Tuesday is 5 inches.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. Let's denote the number of cupcakes as C and the number of brownies as B.

We are given that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be expressed as:

B = 3C - 2

We also know that each person gets two treats, and there are five people in the class. So, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, which can be expressed as:

C + B = 10

Substituting the expression for B from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

C + (3C - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:

4C - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:

4C = 12

Divide both sides by 4:

C = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the manicure and pedicure with the discount, and then add the cost of the nail art.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the manicure and pedicure without the discount. The manicure costs $35 and the pedicure costs $40, so the total cost is $35 + $40 = $75.

Since Karen gets a 20% discount on the total cost, we need to calculate 20% of $75. To do this, we multiply $75 by 0.20, which is $15. So the discount is $15.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the discounted price: $75 - $15 = $60.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the nail art. Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers on each hand (5 fingers on each hand). So, the total number of fingers is 10. The cost of nail art per finger is $3, so the total cost of nail art is 10 x $3 = $30.

Finally, we add the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art to get the total amount Karen would pay: $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of issues Susan receives from each magazine and then add them up.

The first 3 magazines send 12 issues a year, so the total number of issues from these magazines is 3 * 12 = 36.

"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations. Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as 'x'. Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, the number of paintings Shelley has is x + 8. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, so the number of paintings Samantha has is (x + 8) - 12.

We are given that Samantha has 27 paintings. Therefore, we can set up the equation (x + 8) - 12 = 27. To solve for x, we need to isolate x.

First, we simplify the equation: x + 8 - 12 = 27
Combine like terms: x - 4 = 27

Next, we add 4 to both sides of the equation to isolate x: x = 27 + 4
x = 31

"To find the price of the toy after the discount in January, we need to follow the changes in price step by step.

Initially, the price of the toy in November is $40.

In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price:
80% of $40 = 0.8 * $40 = $32
New price in December = $40 + $32 = $72

In January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the price in December:
50% of $72 = 0.5 * $72 = $36
New price in January = $72 - $36 = $36

The price of the toy after the discount in January is $36.

"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the income from the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons separately and then add them together.

For the standard rate lessons, Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 per hour. So, the total income from standard rate lessons is 4 * $80 = $320.

For the reduced rate lessons, Charlie has 2 lessons at a 25% discount. This means he charges 75% of his standard rate, which is 0.75 * $80 = $60 per hour. So, the total income from reduced rate lessons is 2 * $60 = $120.

Now, we add the income from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day: $320 + $120 = $440.

Original amount of pomelos = 20
Amount of pomelos left = 1/4 * 20 = 5

This means Eve had 5 pomelos left after giving some away. To find out how many she gave away, we subtract the amount left from the original amount:

Number of pomelos given away = Original amount - Amount left

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. Walter bought 60 apples and ate 2/5 of them. To find out how many apples he ate, we multiply 60 by 2/5.

60 * (2/5) = 60 * 2 / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples.

2. Now, we need to find out how many apples are left. We subtract the number of apples eaten from the total number of apples.

60 - 24 = 36

3. Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples. To find out how many apples he gave her, we multiply the remaining number of apples by 25% (or 0.25).

36 * 0.25 = 9

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples.

4. Now, we need to find out how many apples are left. We subtract the number of apples given to his sister from the remaining number of apples.

36 - 9 = 27

5. Walter sold the remaining apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find out how much money he received, we multiply the number of remaining apples by the price per apple.

"To determine the distance Michael covers in 3 days, we need to calculate the total time he spends traveling and then multiply it by his average speed.

First, let's convert his average speed to hours per day. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can calculate the total hours he travels in 3 days as follows:

3 days * 24 hours/day = 72 hours

Now, we can multiply the total hours by his average speed to find the total distance covered:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hr
Distance = 3600 km

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered:

Percentage covered = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage covered = 0.6 * 100
Percentage covered = 60%

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.
2. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass, so he used 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.
3. The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.
4. Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the total number of grapes used by their mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.
5. To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we need to add the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother. However, since the grapes used by their mother are the remaining grapes, we need to subtract the grapes used by Madeline and her brother from the total number of grapes used by their mother to find the initial number of grapes. The total number of grapes used by their mother is 48, and the grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 36. So, the initial number of grapes is 48 + 36 = 84.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total number of teachers at school that day, we need to add the number of teachers who were sick to the number of substitute teachers called in. 

First, let's find the number of teachers who were not sick. There were 82 teachers in total, and 13 were sick. So, the number of teachers who were not sick is 82 - 13 = 69.

However, this includes the 9 substitute teachers. To find the total number of teachers at school, we need to add the 9 substitute teachers to the 69 teachers who were not sick. 

So, the total number of teachers at school that day is 69 + 9 = 78.

The final answer is: 78"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients for one week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

The cost of pasta is $1.00 per box. 
The cost of cheddar cheese is $3.00. 
The cost of gruyere cheese is twice the cost of cheddar cheese, which is 2 * $3.00 = $6.00.

The total cost of ingredients for one week is $1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar cheese) + $6.00 (gruyere cheese) = $10.00.

There are 52 weeks in a year. 
So, the total cost of making macaroni and cheese in one year is $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

520.00"
"To find the total number of classrooms the custodian needs to clean, we already know that number is 80. 

The custodian has 5 days to complete the task. We need to find out how many minutes they have to work in total. Since they work 8 hours a day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, they work 8 * 60 = 480 minutes per day.

In 5 days, they work a total of 5 * 480 = 2400 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes they spend cleaning classrooms. It takes them 15 minutes per classroom, and there are 80 classrooms. So, they spend 80 * 15 = 1200 minutes cleaning classrooms.

To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we need to divide the time spent cleaning classrooms by the total time worked and multiply by 100. 

(1200 / 2400) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of books the middle shelves can hold as 'x'. Since there are two middle shelves, the total number of books they can hold is 2x.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2x books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 2x - 5 books.

The total number of books the bookcase can hold is the sum of the books on all shelves: 2x + 2x + (2x - 5) = 6x - 5.

We know that Elly has 110 books, and we need to find out how many bookcases she needs to hold all of them. Let's assume she needs 'n' bookcases.

Since each bookcase can hold 6x - 5 books, the total number of books 'n' bookcases can hold is n(6x - 5).

We are given that Elly has 110 books, so we can set up the equation: n(6x - 5) = 110.

We also know that the middle shelves can hold 10 books each, so 2x = 10, which means x = 5.

Now we can substitute x = 5 into the equation: n(6(5) - 5) = 110.

Simplifying the equation, we get: n(25 - 5) = 110, n(20) = 110.

Dividing both sides by 20, we get: n = 110 / 20 = 5.5.

Since Elly can't have a fraction of a bookcase, she needs to round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can see that 5 bookcases can hold 5 * (6 * 5 - 5) = 5 * 25 = 125 books, which is more than 110 books. Therefore, Elly needs 5 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final answer is: 5"
"To determine Rose's profit, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

First, let's calculate the total cost. Since Rose bought five dozens of eggs, and a dozen is 12 eggs, she bought 5 * 12 = 60 eggs. The cost per dozen is $2.40, so the total cost is 5 * $2.40 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue. Rose will sell the eggs for $1 for 3 eggs. Since she has 60 eggs, she will sell 60 / 3 = 20 sets of 3 eggs. The total revenue is 20 * $1 = $20.

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $20 - $12 = $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To find the number of white hats, we first need to determine the number of hats that are not red. Since half of the hats are red, the number of red hats is 100 * 1/2 = 50.

The remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50. 

Now, 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, so the number of blue hats is 50 * 3/5 = 30.

The number of white hats is the remaining hats that are not red or blue, which is 50 - 30 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we first need to calculate the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and there's a $3.00 discount. 

So, the discounted price of the bag is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we need to divide the discounted price by the number of sticks to find the cost per stick.

Cost per stick = $15.00 / 30 sticks = $0.50 per stick.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100 (since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents).

Cost per stick in cents = $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass 6th grade and then subtract the number of questions she got right on the first test.

First, let's find the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass 6th grade. Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct, we need to find the total number of questions. However, the total number of questions is not given. We can assume that the total number of questions is the sum of the questions in both tests, which is 70 + 40 = 110 questions.

Now, let's calculate the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass 6th grade. 70% of 110 questions is 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions.

Next, let's find out how many questions Audrey got right on the first test. She got 60% of 70 questions correct, which is 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

Now, let's subtract the number of questions she got right on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly to pass 6th grade. 77 - 42 = 35 questions.

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B. We know that B = 5S - 4.

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, which is the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes. So, we can write the equation: S + B = 116.

Substituting the expression for B from the first equation into the second equation, we get: S + (5S - 4) = 116.

Combine like terms: 6S - 4 = 116.

Add 4 to both sides: 6S = 120.

Divide both sides by 6: S = 20.

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting S into the equation B = 5S - 4: B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

The final answer is: 96"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of points Ara has scored in four years. 

First, we need to find out the total number of games she has played in four years. Since she plays 40 games every year, we multiply the number of games she plays per year by the number of years:

40 games/year * 4 years = 160 games

Next, we need to find out the total number of points she has scored. Since she scores 21 points for every game, we multiply the total number of games by her score per game:

160 games * 21 points/game = 3360 points

Therefore, Ara has scored a total of 3360 points in four years.

The final answer is: 3360"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Brendan had 10 marbles.

1. He dropped half of them, so he had 10 / 2 = 5 marbles left.
2. He found 3 more marbles, so now he had 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.
3. However, one of the marbles he picked up was a bead, not a marble. So, we need to subtract 1 from the total number of marbles he had, which is 8 - 1 = 7.

Therefore, Brendan ended up with 7 marbles.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know that for every 2 customers who come into the dealership, 1 will buy a car. This means that for every 2 customers, Jason will sell 1 car. Since Jason needs to sell 15 cars, he will need 15 * 2 = 30 customers to come into the dealership.

Next, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer will come into the dealership. To find out how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to get 30 customers, we can set up a proportion: 25 calls / 1 customer = x calls / 30 customers. 

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 25 * 30 = 1 * x, which gives us 750 = x. Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to get 30 customers, and subsequently, to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

The final answer is: 750"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of flashlights and candles used by Brianna's family.

First, let's calculate the total number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the family, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Next, let's calculate the total number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house, and half of them have 4 small candles each, while the other half have 5 medium candles each. Half of 8 is 4, so there are 4 rooms with 4 small candles each and 4 rooms with 5 medium candles each.

The total number of small candles is 4 rooms * 4 candles per room = 16 small candles.

The total number of medium candles is 4 rooms * 5 candles per room = 20 medium candles.

The total number of candles is the sum of small and medium candles, which is 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

Now, we add the total number of flashlights and candles to get the final answer.

Total number of flashlights and candles = 4 (flashlights) + 36 (candles) = 40

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it takes to complete all 6 sides of the Rubik's cube. 

The first side takes 5 minutes. 
The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each. 
The last two sides take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all 6 sides: 
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

However, we need to consider that the last two sides are completed once the fifth side is done, so we should not add the time for the fifth side again. 

The correct total time is: 
5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 = 27.5 minutes

"To determine the number of calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spends at work and then convert that to minutes. 

First, let's calculate the total hours he spends at work in a week: 
6 hours/day * 5 days = 30 hours

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total hours to minutes: 
30 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 1800 minutes

Now, we can calculate the number of calls he deals with in a week by dividing the total minutes by the time it takes to deal with a call: 
1800 minutes / 15 minutes/call = 120 calls

"This question seems to be a straightforward application of mathematical reasoning, but it can also be approached from a philosophical perspective, particularly in the realm of epistemology and the nature of time. However, to provide a numerical answer, we will focus on the mathematical aspect.

Let's break down the problem:

1. The old varnish takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting.
2. The new varnish takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting.
3. Louise needs to apply the varnish to 6 paintings.

To find the total time it takes for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings, we multiply the time it takes for one painting by the number of paintings: 7 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 42 minutes.

To find the total time it takes for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings, we multiply the time it takes for one painting by the number of paintings: 12 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 72 minutes.

Now, to find the difference in time, we subtract the time it takes for the old varnish to dry from the time it takes for the new varnish to dry: 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes.

Therefore, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish.

"To determine the total amount of water Crista needs, we must first calculate the amount of water each group of plants requires and then sum these amounts.

The 4 plants that need half a cup of water require 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups of water.

The 8 plants that need 1 cup of water require 8 * 1 = 8 cups of water.

The remaining plants are 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 plants. These plants need a quarter of a cup of water, so they require 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups of water.

To find the total amount of water Crista needs, we add the water required for each group: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it takes for Phineas to hop back half the distance and the time it takes for him to swim back the other half.

First, let's calculate the total distance Phineas needs to cover. Since he was washed 200 yards away from his home, he needs to cover 200 yards to get back. Half of this distance is 200 / 2 = 100 yards.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for Phineas to hop back 100 yards on land. His speed on land is 20 yards per minute, so the time it takes is 100 / 20 = 5 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Phineas to swim back the other 100 yards in the water. His speed in water is 10 yards per minute, so the time it takes is 100 / 10 = 10 minutes.

Since these two parts are independent of each other, we can simply add the times together to get the total time it takes for Phineas to return home. 5 minutes (hopping) + 10 minutes (swimming) = 15 minutes.

"To determine the cost of the popsicle sticks, we need to calculate how many boxes Bob needs to buy. Since he needs 56 popsicle sticks and each box contains 8 sticks, we can divide the total number of sticks needed by the number of sticks per box.

56 popsicle sticks / 8 popsicle sticks per box = 7 boxes

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of boxes needed by the cost per box.

7 boxes * $2.00 per box = $14.00

The final answer is: $14.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of the additional phones and then add the cost of the main phone to it.

Let's assume the cost of each additional phone is x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We are given that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation 2x = 20 to find the cost of each additional phone.

Solving for x, we get x = 20 / 2 = 10.

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is 4x = 4 * 10 = 40.

The total cost of the phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones, which is 20 + 40 = 60.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many batches Jade needs to upload to upload all her photos. Since she uploads 6 batches each day, we can divide the total number of photos by the number of batches she uploads per day to find the total number of days.

Total photos = 210
Batches per day = 6

Total batches = Total photos / Batches per day
Total batches = 210 / 6
Total batches = 35

Since Jade can upload 7 photos in one batch, we need to find out how many batches she needs to upload to cover all her photos. However, we already know that she needs 35 batches to cover all her photos. 

Now, we need to find out how many days she needs to upload these batches. Since she uploads 6 batches each day, we can divide the total number of batches by the number of batches she uploads per day.

Total batches = 35
Batches per day = 6

Days needed = Total batches / Batches per day
Days needed = 35 / 6
Days needed = 5.83

Since Jade can't upload a fraction of a day, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, she will need 6 days to upload all her photos.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate John's new speaking speed after training. 

His original speed is 150 WPM (words per minute). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so his new speed is 150 * 2.5 = 375 WPM.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so 10 pages have 10 * 450 = 4500 words.

Now, we can calculate the time it would take John to speak 4500 words at his new speed. Time = Total words / Speed. 

Time = 4500 words / 375 WPM = 12 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

On the first day, there were 50 people at the beach. 

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the number of people on the second day is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day, so the number of people on the third day is 2 * 70 = 140.

Now, we know the number of people for the first three days: 50, 70, and 140. 

The rest of the week consists of 4 more days. We are given that Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the rest of the week. 

To find the total number of people for the rest of the week, we multiply the average by the number of days: 60 * 4 = 240.

Now, we add the number of people for the first three days to the number of people for the rest of the week: 50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 400.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 400."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and calculate the number of kernels that popped in each 30-second interval.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount popped, so 3 * 20 = 60 kernels popped.
3. In the next 30 seconds, four times the amount that popped in the second 30 seconds popped, so 4 * 60 = 240 kernels popped.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping slowed down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 0.5 * 240 = 120 kernels popped.

Now, let's calculate the total number of kernels that popped during cooking: 20 + 60 + 240 + 120 = 340 kernels.

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat. A quarter of 120 is 120 / 4 = 30 kernels.

To find the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat, we add the kernels that popped during cooking and the kernels that popped from residual heat: 340 + 30 = 370.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of lemonade Tim needs to make, including the extra gallon for Allen. Since Tim needs to make 4 gallons of regular lemonade and 1 gallon of extra tart lemonade, he will need to make a total of 5 gallons.

Since 1 cup of lemon juice is required for 1 gallon of lemonade, and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the total amount of lemons needed for 5 gallons of lemonade. 

For 5 gallons, we need 5 cups of lemon juice. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the total number of lemons needed as follows:

Total lemons = Total cups of juice * 6 lemons/cup
Total lemons = 5 cups * 6 lemons/cup
Total lemons = 30 lemons

However, the extra gallon of lemonade needs to be twice as tart as the other gallons. This means it will require twice the amount of lemon juice, which is 2 cups. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we need to add the lemons required for this extra cup of juice to the total.

Extra lemons for extra tart lemonade = 2 cups * 6 lemons/cup
Extra lemons for extra tart lemonade = 12 lemons

Now, we add the lemons required for the regular lemonade and the extra tart lemonade to get the total number of lemons needed:

Total lemons = 30 lemons + 12 lemons
Total lemons = 42 lemons

"To determine the total amount of dog food needed for a week, we need to calculate the daily consumption of both breeds and then multiply it by 7.

The German Shepherds consume 5 kilograms each per day, and there are 3 of them. So, their total daily consumption is 5 * 3 = 15 kilograms.

The Bulldogs consume 3 kilograms each per day, and there are 2 of them. So, their total daily consumption is 3 * 2 = 6 kilograms.

The total daily consumption of both breeds is 15 + 6 = 21 kilograms.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 21 * 7 = 147 kilograms.

Therefore, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs on the farm. 

First, let's calculate the total number of legs of the 2-legged animals: 10 animals * 2 legs per animal = 20 legs.

Next, let's calculate the total number of legs of the 4-legged animals: 15 animals * 4 legs per animal = 60 legs.

Now, we add the total number of legs of the 2-legged animals and the 4-legged animals to get the total number of legs on the farm: 20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs.

However, the question asks for the number of pairs of animal legs. Since each pair consists of 2 legs, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the number of pairs: 80 legs / 2 = 40 pairs.

"To solve this problem, we can start by identifying the known quantities. We know that the tower is made up of 4 blue blocks and twice as many yellow blocks, which means there are 2 * 4 = 8 yellow blocks. 

The total number of blue and yellow blocks is 4 + 8 = 12. Since the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, the number of red blocks can be found by subtracting the number of blue and yellow blocks from the total. 

Red blocks = Total blocks - (Blue blocks + Yellow blocks)
Red blocks = 32 - 12
Red blocks = 20

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Elvis traveled in both directions and then determine the remaining distance from his house.

First, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled west. Since he traveled for 5 hours at a speed of 18mph, the distance traveled west is:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 18mph * 5 hours
Distance = 90 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled east. Since he traveled for 8 hours at a speed of 18mph, the distance traveled east is:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 18mph * 8 hours
Distance = 144 miles

Now, let's calculate the total distance Elvis traveled in both directions. Since he traveled 90 miles west and 144 miles east, the net distance from his house is the difference between the two:

Net Distance = Distance Traveled East - Distance Traveled West
Net Distance = 144 miles - 90 miles
Net Distance = 54 miles

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the depreciation of the boat over the three years. 

First, let's calculate the depreciation for the first year. The boat depreciated by 30% of its original value, which is 0.3 * $9000 = $2700. So, the value of the boat after the first year is $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

In the second year, the boat depreciated by 30% of its value after the first year, which is 0.3 * $6300 = $1890. So, the value of the boat after the second year is $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

In the third year, the boat depreciated by 20% of its value after the second year, which is 0.2 * $4410 = $882. So, the value of the boat after the third year is $4410 - $882 = $3528.

The final value of the boat after the three years is $3528."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of orange and yellow candies. We are given that there are 54 red candies and that there are twice as many orange candies as red candies. 

Let's denote the number of orange candies as O. Since there are twice as many orange candies as red candies, we can write the equation: O = 2 * 54. 

O = 2 * 54
O = 108

Now, we are given that there are half as many yellow candies as red candies. Let's denote the number of yellow candies as Y. We can write the equation: Y = 54 / 2.

Y = 54 / 2
Y = 27

We know that the total number of candies is 232. We can add up the number of red, orange, and yellow candies to find the total number of non-pink candies. 

Total non-pink candies = 54 (red) + 108 (orange) + 27 (yellow)
Total non-pink candies = 189

To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of non-pink candies from the total number of candies.

Number of pink candies = Total number of candies - Total non-pink candies
Number of pink candies = 232 - 189
Number of pink candies = 43

The final answer is: 43"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the hotel and the bus trips separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the hotel. The cost of one night at the hotel is $80, and Helen stayed for 3 nights. So, the total cost of the hotel is:

$80 * 3 = $240

Next, let's calculate the cost of the bus trips. The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel, which is:

$80 * 0.10 = $8

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus trips is:

$8 * 7 = $56

Now, we add the total cost of the hotel and the bus trips to get the total cost of Helen's trip:

$240 + $56 = $296

The final answer is: $296"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many marbles Dallas received from Mazie. We know that Dallas has a total of 21 marbles after dropping 4 of them, so he must have had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles before dropping any. 

Since Mazie gave the twins a total of 52 marbles, and Dallas received 25, we can find out how many marbles Darla received by subtracting 25 from 52. 

52 - 25 = 27

So, Darla received 27 marbles from Mazie.

27"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and the total cost of the popcorns, then add them together.

"To determine the total weight of the car and its contents, we need to add the weight of the car, the luggage, and the two children. 

Total weight = weight of car + weight of luggage + weight of children
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + (2 * 75)
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we need to calculate 1% of 1600.

Force required = 1% * 1600
Force required = 0.01 * 1600
Force required = 16 pounds

"To determine the amount of crepe paper James needs, we must calculate the perimeter of the backyard fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2l + 2w, where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the length (l) is 20 feet and the width (w) is 15 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(20) + 2(15)
P = 40 + 30
P = 70

Therefore, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to go around the entire fence.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the average age of Mia and Emma, we first need to determine Emma's age. Since Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart in age, we can calculate Emma's age by adding 16 to Mia's age.

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now that we know both Mia's and Emma's ages, we can find the average of their ages by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

Therefore, the total number of good seashells they found together is 665."
"To determine the total cost of the place settings, we need to calculate the cost of each type of plate and then multiply it by the number of people, since Avery is having 12 people over and each person will need a set of plates.

The cost of dinner plates is $6.00 each, and she needs 12 dinner plates, so the total cost of dinner plates is 12 * $6.00 = $72.00.

The cost of bowls is $5.00 each, and she needs 12 bowls, so the total cost of bowls is 12 * $5.00 = $60.00.

The cost of salad plates is $4.00 each, and she needs 12 salad plates, so the total cost of salad plates is 12 * $4.00 = $48.00.

To find the total cost of the place settings, we need to add the cost of dinner plates, bowls, and salad plates: $72.00 + $60.00 + $48.00 = $180.00.

Therefore, Avery will spend $180.00 on place settings.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by the pigs in a week and then subtract that from the total amount of feed ordered.

First, let's calculate the amount of feed consumed by the pigs in a day. Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so the total amount of feed consumed by one pig in a day is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

Since Dexter has 5 pigs, the total amount of feed consumed by all the pigs in a day is 8 * 5 = 40 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of feed consumed by the pigs in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of feed consumed in a week is 40 * 7 = 280 pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so the amount of feed left after a week is 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of hot dogs John needs to buy. 

First, we calculate the total number of hot dogs needed for the party. Since each guest will eat 2 hot dogs and there are 20 guests, the total number of hot dogs needed is 20 * 2 = 40.

However, John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. So, the total number of hot dogs he needs to buy is 40 - 4 = 36.

Since each pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2, we need to find out how many packs John needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total number of hot dogs he needs to buy (36) by the number of hot dogs in each pack (6). 

36 / 6 = 6

Since John needs to buy 6 packs of hot dogs, and each pack costs $2, the total amount he needs to spend is 6 * 2 = 12.

20 cupcakes * $2 per cupcake = $40

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Frances earns from selling cookies:

40 cookies * $1 per cookie = $40

Now, let's add the earnings from cupcakes and cookies:

$40 (cupcakes) + $40 (cookies) = $80

Frances buys five trays at $4 for each tray, so the total cost of the trays is:

5 trays * $4 per tray = $20

Now, let's subtract the cost of the trays from the total earnings:

$80 (earnings) - $20 (cost of trays) = $60

Frances has $60 left.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 5 children following the truck.

On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child, so the total number of children becomes 5 + 5 = 10.

On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children, so the total number of children becomes 10 + (10 * 2) = 10 + 20 = 30.

The original 5 children then give up and leave the group, so we subtract 5 from the total number of children: 30 - 5 = 25.

Therefore, there are 25 children now following the truck.

"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to calculate the total number of meals she has already distributed and subtract that from the initial number of meals she had.

On Friday, she gave out 64 meals.
On Saturday, she gave out 30 meals.
On Sunday, she gave out 48 meals.

Total meals distributed = 64 + 30 + 48 = 142 meals

Now, we subtract the total meals distributed from the initial number of meals she had:
Initial meals = 1,360
Meals left = Initial meals - Total meals distributed
Meals left = 1,360 - 142
Meals left = 1,218

"To calculate the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we need to break it down into two parts: meditation and yoga.

Meditation: Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, 7 days a week. However, we are only considering 5 days a week for yoga practice, but since meditation is not dependent on yoga, we will consider 7 days a week for meditation. 

In a week, she meditates for 15 minutes * 2 = 30 minutes per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, she meditates for 30 minutes * 7 days = 210 minutes per week.

In 4 weeks, she meditates for 210 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 840 minutes.

Yoga: Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) 5 days a week. 

In a week, she practices yoga for 60 minutes * 5 days = 300 minutes per week.

In 4 weeks, she practices yoga for 300 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1200 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of seeds in a small sunflower and then calculate the number of seeds in a large sunflower. 

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since a dozen is equal to 12, we can calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower as follows:

3 dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 seeds

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find the number of seeds in a large sunflower, we need to calculate 50% of the seeds in a small sunflower and add it to the number of seeds in a small sunflower.

50% of 36 seeds = 0.5 * 36 = 18 seeds

Now, we add the 50% more seeds to the number of seeds in a small sunflower:

36 seeds + 18 seeds = 54 seeds

So, a large sunflower has 54 seeds.

To find the total number of seeds in both sunflowers, we add the number of seeds in a small sunflower and a large sunflower:

36 seeds + 54 seeds = 90 seeds

Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we can calculate Timothy's pens as follows:

Timothy's pens = 3 * George's pens
Timothy's pens = 3 * 18
Timothy's pens = 54

Now, we know that Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy. So, we can calculate Sarah's pens as follows:

Sarah's pens = 1/2 * Timothy's pens
Sarah's pens = 1/2 * 54
Sarah's pens = 27

Therefore, Sarah has 27 pens.

"To determine the total amount of money the company will receive for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks and then multiply it by the price per bar.

First, let's calculate the number of bars produced in one week. Since the company produces 5000 bars in a day, we multiply this number by 7 (the number of days in a week):

5000 bars/day * 7 days/week = 35,000 bars/week

Now, we multiply the number of bars produced in one week by 2 to find the total number of bars produced in two weeks:

35,000 bars/week * 2 weeks = 70,000 bars

Since each bar is sold for $2, we multiply the total number of bars by the price per bar:

70,000 bars * $2/bar = $140,000

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, the total cost of the T-shirts without the discount is 2 * $8 = $16. However, Jake gets a buy one get one 50% off deal, which means that one of the T-shirts is 50% off. So, the cost of the first T-shirt is $8, and the cost of the second T-shirt is $8 - ($8 * 0.5) = $4. The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and Jake gets a 40% discount. The discount amount is $40 * 0.4 = $16. So, the cost of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so T = 16 / 2 = 8.

We also know that Igor gathered two more Petri dishes than requested, so P = 14 + 2 = 16.

The total number of items Igor had is 29, and we know that T + B + P = 29.

Substituting the values we know, we get 8 + B + 16 = 29.

Simplifying the equation, we get B + 24 = 29.

Subtracting 24 from both sides, we get B = 5.

However, we know that Igor initially picked up the correct number of beakers, which is 7. Since he lost some beakers, the number of beakers he had left is 5.

To find the number of beakers he lost, we subtract the number of beakers he had left from the initial number of beakers: 7 - 5 = 2.

We also know that Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, so if Aaron runs a distance D, Vanessa runs 2D. Given that Vanessa ran 4 miles, we can say that D = 2 miles (since 2D = 4 miles).

Since Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. For Aaron, this becomes 16 = 2 / A. We can substitute A = 2V into this equation to get 16 = 2 / (2V), which simplifies to 16 = 1 / V.

To find V, we can take the reciprocal of both sides of the equation, which gives us V = 1 / 16. This is the speed at which Vanessa runs.

Now, we can use the formula time = distance / speed to find the time it took Vanessa to complete her part of the race. The distance is 4 miles, and the speed is 1 / 16 miles per minute. Plugging these values into the formula, we get time = 4 / (1 / 16) = 4 * 16 = 64 minutes.

The final answer is: 64"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of line required for the dock and subtract the amount the caretaker already has.

First, we calculate the total amount of line needed for the dock. Since the caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, we multiply 3 by 200 to get the total amount of line needed:

3 feet/foot * 200 feet = 600 feet

Since the caretaker already has 6 feet of line, we subtract this from the total amount needed:

600 feet - 6 feet = 594 feet

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total.

The final answer is: 594"
"To determine how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate their daily revenue and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

First, let's calculate the daily revenue. They get 6 reservations a night, and each reservation includes 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine. 

Daily revenue = (6 reservations * 2 meals * $5) + (6 reservations * $5)
Daily revenue = (6 * 2 * $5) + (6 * $5)
Daily revenue = $60 + $30
Daily revenue = $90

Since they are open 2 days a week, we multiply the daily revenue by 2.

Weekly revenue = $90 * 2
Weekly revenue = $180

The final answer is: $180"
"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we first need to determine the total revenue from selling all the watermelons. Since the vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80 and sold them at a 25% profit, we can calculate the total revenue as follows:

Let's denote the cost price of each watermelon as CP and the selling price as SP. The total cost price of 50 watermelons is $80, so we can write:

50 * CP = 80

To find the cost price of each watermelon, we divide both sides by 50:

CP = 80 / 50
CP = 1.6

Now, we know the cost price of each watermelon is $1.6. The vendor sold the watermelons at a 25% profit, so the selling price of each watermelon is 125% of the cost price (100% + 25% profit):

SP = CP * 1.25
SP = 1.6 * 1.25
SP = 2

The selling price of each watermelon is $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. James is now twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. This means that James is currently 2 * 12 = 24 years old.

2. Since James is 24 years old now, and John had James when he was 19, we can calculate John's current age by adding the age difference between John and James. John's current age = 19 + 24 = 43.

3. John's youngest son was born when John was 32. To find the current age of the youngest son, we subtract 32 from John's current age. Current age of the youngest son = 43 - 32 = 11.

4. To find the age of the youngest son in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age. Age in 3 years = 11 + 3 = 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges each person can peel in an hour and then find the difference between their rates.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane in an hour is 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount and then add the labor cost.

First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original price is $400, and Mark gets it for 80% off. This means he pays 20% of the original price. 

20% of $400 is 0.2 x $400 = $80.

So, Mark pays $80 for the radiator.

Next, let's calculate the labor cost. The mechanic works for 3 hours at $50 an hour. 

Labor cost = 3 hours x $50/hour = $150.

Now, let's add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost to find the total amount Mark paid.

Total cost = $80 (radiator) + $150 (labor) = $230.

The final answer is: $230"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Farmer Brown has a total of 20 animals, and they are either chickens or cows. We also know that the total number of legs is 70.

Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs. Let's use the variable 'c' to represent the number of chickens and 'w' to represent the number of cows.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:

1. The total number of animals: c + w = 20
2. The total number of legs: 2c + 4w = 70

We can solve the first equation for 'w': w = 20 - c

Now, substitute this expression for 'w' into the second equation: 2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

Expand the equation: 2c + 80 - 4c = 70

Combine like terms: -2c + 80 = 70

Subtract 80 from both sides: -2c = -10

Divide both sides by -2: c = 5

Therefore, the number of chickens is 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to divide the total number of pizza slices by the number of people sharing them. 

First, we need to find the total number of pizza slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is 7 * 8 = 56.

Next, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people, which is 4 (Henry and his 3 friends). 

So, the number of slices each person can have is 56 / 4 = 14.

The final answer is: 14"
