"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first determine how many eggs she has left after eating and baking. 

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and bakes 4 for muffins, so she uses a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. 

Now, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left.

Janet sells these 9 eggs at $2 each, so she makes 9 * 2 = $18 per day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts needed, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, we can calculate the white fiber as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we add the blue fiber and white fiber to get the total:

Total bolts = 2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit Josh made, we first need to determine the value of the house after the repairs. 

Let's denote the original value of the house as V. After the repairs, the value of the house increased by 150%, which means the new value is 2.5 times the original value (100% + 150% = 250%, or 2.5 times the original value).

The original value of the house is $80,000, and Josh added $50,000 in repairs. The total value after repairs is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000. However, we know that this is 2.5 times the original value, so we can set up the equation:

2.5V = 130,000

To find the original value V, we can divide both sides by 2.5:

V = 130,000 / 2.5
V = 52,000

Now that we know the original value of the house, we can find the profit Josh made. The profit is the difference between the final value and the original value, which is $130,000 - $80,000 = $50,000. However, Josh also added $50,000 in repairs, so we need to subtract that from the profit to find the actual profit:

Profit = $50,000 - $50,000 = $0

However, this is not the correct answer. Josh's profit is actually the difference between the final value and the original cost, which is $130,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $0. However, Josh's profit is actually the difference between the final value and the original cost, which is $130,000 - $80,000 = $50,000."
"To find the total number of meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total number of meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sprint sessions he has in a week.

Since James runs 3 sprints in one session, and each sprint is 60 meters, the total meters he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James has 3 sprint sessions in a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

The final answer is: 540"
"To find the total number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to determine the total number of cups of feed she gives her chickens in a day. 

In the morning, she gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives her chickens 25 cups of feed. So, the total number of cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi feeds each of her chickens 3 cups of feed per day, and she has a flock of 20 chickens, the total number of cups of feed she needs to give her chickens in a day is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

Now, we subtract the total number of cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total number of cups of feed needed for the day to find the number of cups of feed needed in the final meal. 

60 - 40 = 20 cups.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 

The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * 5 = $3. 

The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * 3 = $1.8. 

We can see that the cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of the previous glass. This forms a geometric sequence with the first term a = 5 and the common ratio r = 0.6.

The total number of glasses Kylar wants to buy is 16. Since the first glass is already given, we need to find the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The cost of the remaining 15 glasses can be calculated using the formula for the sum of a geometric series: S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

Plugging in the values, we get: S = 5 * (1 - 0.6^15) / (1 - 0.6)

S = 5 * (1 - 0.006046) / 0.4
S = 5 * 0.993954 / 0.4
S = 5 * 2.483885
S = 12.419425

The cost of the first glass is $5. 

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses: 
Total cost = 5 + 12.419425
Total cost = 17.419425

The final answer is: $17.42"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of sheep in Toulouse and Charleston first. 

Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, we can find the number of sheep in Charleston by multiplying 20 by 4. 

Charleston has 20 * 4 = 80 sheep.

Since Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, we can find the number of sheep in Toulouse by multiplying 80 by 2.

Toulouse has 80 * 2 = 160 sheep.

Now, we can find the total number of sheep by adding the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle.

Total sheep = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how long it would take Carla to download the file without any interruptions. 

The total size of the file is 200 GB. Carla can download 2 GB/minute. 

Time taken to download the file = Total size / Download speed
Time taken to download the file = 200 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time taken to download the file = 100 minutes

Now, let's consider the interruption. Carla downloads 40% of the file before the interruption. 

40% of 200 GB = 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB

Time taken to download 80 GB = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

After the interruption, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. The remaining 60% of the file is 120 GB. 

Time taken to download the remaining 120 GB = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

Total time taken = Time taken to download 80 GB + Time taken to download the remaining 120 GB + Time taken for the interruption
Total time taken = 40 minutes + 60 minutes + 20 minutes
Total time taken = 120 minutes

The final answer is: 120"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance John travels to the point where he turns around, and the distance he travels back home.

First, let's calculate the distance John travels to the point where he turns around. He drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 * 3
Distance = 180 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance John travels back home. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time. Then, he drives for half an hour at a speed of 30 mph.

Distance covered in the last half hour = Speed * Time
Distance covered in the last half hour = 30 * 0.5
Distance covered in the last half hour = 15 miles

The remaining time to cover the distance back home is 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours. He drives at a speed of 80 mph during this time.

Distance covered in the remaining 1.5 hours = Speed * Time
Distance covered in the remaining 1.5 hours = 80 * 1.5
Distance covered in the remaining 1.5 hours = 120 miles

Now, let's calculate the total distance John travels back home. We subtract the distance covered in the last half hour from the distance covered in the remaining 1.5 hours, and add the distance covered in the last half hour to the distance covered in the first 2 hours (which is 0).

Total distance back home = Distance covered in the remaining 1.5 hours - Distance covered in the last half hour
Total distance back home = 120 - 15
Total distance back home = 105 miles

However, we need to add the distance John traveled to the point where he turns around to the total distance back home to get the total distance from home at the end of those 4 hours.

Total distance from home = Distance to the point where he turns around + Total distance back home
Total distance from home = 180 + 105
Total distance from home = 285 miles

The final answer is: 285"
"To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately, then add them together.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so her overtime rate is $10 * 1.2 = $12/hour. Her overtime earnings are:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Her total earnings for the week are:
$400 + $60 = $460

"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. Then, we subtract 54 from 180 to get 126 downloads in the third month.

Now, we add the downloads from each month together: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 * $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 * $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, we add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The final answer is: $694"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the break-even point, which is the point at which the total cost of planting and maintaining the tree equals the total revenue from selling the lemons.

Let's denote the number of years as 'n'. The total cost of planting the tree is $90. The annual cost of watering and feeding the tree is $3. The total revenue from selling the lemons is 7n * $1.5.

The total cost is the sum of the initial cost and the annual costs, which is $90 + $3n. The total revenue is 7n * $1.5.

To find the break-even point, we set the total cost equal to the total revenue and solve for 'n':

$90 + $3n = 7n * $1.5

Subtract $3n from both sides:

$90 = 7n * $1.5 - $3n
$90 = 4.5n

Divide both sides by 4.5:

n = $90 / 4.5
n = 20

However, this is the point at which the tree breaks even, but we want to know when it starts earning money. Since the tree starts earning money after the break-even point, we need to add 1 to 'n':

n = 20 + 1
n = 21

The final answer is: 21"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

At the green house, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners, which is x/3.

At the red house, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners.

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which is (x - x/3 - 2)/2.

We know that after selling at all three houses, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 6 to get rid of the fractions:

6x - 2x - 12 - 3(x - x/3 - 2) = 30

Combine like terms:

4x - 12 - 3x + x + 6 = 30

Combine like terms:

2x - 6 = 30

Add 6 to both sides:

2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, and then subtract that from the total number of students.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20 * 0.2 = 4 students

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
16 * 0.25 = 4 students

The number of students enrolled in jazz dance is 4, and the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance is 4. So, the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students.

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To maximize profit, we need to consider the potential increase in value of both options. 

Let's calculate the potential increase in value for each option:

Jewelry: 2.5% of $5,000 = 0.025 * $5,000 = $125
Electronic gadgets: 1.2% of $8,000 = 0.012 * $8,000 = $96

Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, we should choose the option with the higher potential increase in value, which is the jewelry. 

However, we need to calculate the profit, not the increase in value. To do this, we need to know the initial cost of the jewelry and the electronic gadgets, which is $5,000 and $8,000 respectively. 

Since the merchant is looking to maximize profit, we should choose the option with the higher initial cost, which is the electronic gadgets. 

Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Since we don't know the selling price, we will assume the selling price is the initial cost plus the increase in value.

Selling price of jewelry = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125
Selling price of electronic gadgets = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

Profit from jewelry = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125
Profit from electronic gadgets = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

The profit from the electronic gadgets is less than the profit from the jewelry. However, the question asks for the profit, not the difference in profit. 

Since the profit from the electronic gadgets is less, we will consider the profit from the electronic gadgets as the answer.

The final answer is: $96"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered on the first day and the distance covered on the second day.

On the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance. 

On the second day, they travel 150 miles northward. Again, since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance.

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:

She works 35 hours a week as a teacher and gets paid $20 per hour. Since she works 50 weeks a year, her total hours worked as a teacher in a year is:
35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year

Her earnings from teaching in a year is:
1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:

She works 15 hours a week as a coach and gets paid $30 per hour. Since she works 50 weeks a year, her total hours worked as a coach in a year is:
15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year

Her earnings from coaching in a year is:
750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
$35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To find out how many eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week and then multiply it by 4.

Since Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. 

There are 7 days in a week, so she eats 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week.

In 4 weeks, she will eat 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she will eat in 4 weeks.

84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozen eggs.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total time Marissa has available to complete the remaining distance and then calculate the required speed.

Marissa has already walked 4 miles in 1 hour and 2 miles in another hour, so she has spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles. 

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles, and she has already walked 6 miles, so the remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles.

Since Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, and she has already spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles, she has 12 - 2 = 10 hours left to complete the remaining 6 miles.

To find the required speed, we divide the remaining distance (6 miles) by the remaining time (10 hours).

Required speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time
= 6 miles / 10 hours
= 0.6 miles per hour

The final answer is: 0.6"
"To find the amount of water in the orange drink, we first need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. 

Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters.

Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in the orange drink is 6.67 liters.

Now, to find the amount of water in the pineapple drink, we need to calculate three-fifths of 15 liters.

Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is 9 liters.

Now, we have 6.67 liters of water from the orange drink and 9 liters of water from the pineapple drink. However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract 1/3 of the water from the orange drink (since 1 liter is 1/10 of the original 10 liters of orange drink).

1/10 of 6.67 liters is (1/10) * 6.67 = 0.667 liters.

So, the amount of water from the orange drink after spilling is 6.67 - 0.667 = 6 liters.

Now, we add the water from the orange drink and the pineapple drink: 6 liters + 9 liters = 15 liters.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 15 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the age of Raymond when his son was born. 

First, we know that Samantha is 31 years old now. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we can find Raymond's current age by adding 6 to Samantha's age: 31 + 6 = 37.

We also know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find the age of Raymond when his son was born, we need to subtract 23 from his current age: 37 - 23 = 14.

Now, we need to find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born. Since Samantha is 31 years old now, and we know that Raymond was 14 years old when his son was born, we can find the number of years since his son was born by subtracting 14 from Samantha's age: 31 - 14 = 17.

However, this is the number of years since Raymond's son was born, not how many years ago. To find how many years ago, we need to subtract the age of the son at birth from the current number of years since his birth. Since we don't know the son's current age, we need to find it first. 

We know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23, and we know that the current year is 31 - 6 = 25 for Raymond. So, the son is 25 - 23 = 2 years old now.

Now, we can find how many years ago the son was born by subtracting his age from the number of years since his birth: 17 - 2 = 15.

"To find the total number of DVDs sold by Billy, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers.

The first 3 customers buy one DVD each, so the total number of DVDs sold to them is 3 * 1 = 3.

The next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each, so the total number of DVDs sold to them is 2 * 2 = 4.

The last 3 customers don't buy any DVDs, so the total number of DVDs sold to them is 0.

Now, we add the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers: 3 + 4 = 7.

Therefore, the total number of DVDs sold by Billy on Tuesday is 7.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to use the concept of percentage decrease. 

Let's denote the original price as 'x'. Since there's a 25% discount, the amount of the discount is 25% of the original price, which is 0.25x.

The discounted price is the original price minus the discount, so we can set up the equation:

x - 0.25x = 19.50

Combine like terms:

0.75x = 19.50

Now, divide both sides by 0.75 to solve for x:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To find the total cost of the items Marie ordered excluding the pizza, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken meal, the milk, and the apples.

Cost of chicken meal: $12
Cost of 5 packs of milk: 5 * $3 = $15
Cost of 4 apples: 4 * $1.50 = $6
Total cost of chicken meal, milk, and apples: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes can be found by subtracting the total cost of the other items from the total amount paid.

Cost of pizza boxes: $50 - $33 = $17

Now, we need to find the number of boxes of pizza. Each box costs $8.50, so we can divide the total cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of one box to find the number of boxes.

Number of boxes of pizza: $17 / $8.50 = 2

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she buys and multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will need 60 cartons of ice cream for 60 days (1 serving per night * 60 nights).

Each carton has 15 servings, so to find the total number of cartons, we divide the total number of servings needed (60) by the number of servings per carton (15):

60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Now, we multiply the total number of cartons by the cost per carton:

4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

"To find the distance traveled between Henry's first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip was 60 miles, we can find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip by subtracting 15 miles from 60 miles. 

60 - 15 = 45 miles

Now, we know that the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip.

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip = 60 miles
Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip = 45 miles

Distance between the first and second stops = 60 - 45
Distance between the first and second stops = 15 miles

However, this is the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip minus the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip. To find the distance between the first and second stops, we need to subtract the distance from the first stop to the second stop, which is 15 miles.

Distance between the first and second stops = 20 - 15
Distance between the first and second stops = 5 miles

The distance between Henry's first and second stops is 5 miles.

"Let's denote the cost of the boots as B, the cost of the first pair of heels as H1, and the cost of the second pair of heels as H2. We are given that H1 = $33 and H2 = 2 * H1 = 2 * 33 = $66.

We are also given that the total cost of the two pairs of heels is $5 less than the cost of the boots. This can be expressed as:

H1 + H2 = B - 5

Substituting the values of H1 and H2, we get:

33 + 66 = B - 5

Combine like terms:

99 = B - 5

Add 5 to both sides:

104 = B

The boots cost $104."
"Let's denote Darrell's age as 7x and Allen's age as 11x, where x is a constant. 

Since their total age is 162, we can set up the equation: 7x + 11x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age: 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is: 109"

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.
The second person guesses 20 more than half of the first one, which is (80 / 2) + 20 = 60.
The third person guesses 25% more than the first one, which is 80 + (0.25 * 80) = 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, let's add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

There are 3 people, so we divide the total by 3 to find the average: 240 / 3 = 80.

Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. Since John takes care of 10 dogs, the total hours he spends per day is:
10 dogs * 0.5 hours/dog = 5 hours/day

Now, we multiply the daily hours by 7 to get the total hours per week:
5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

The final answer is: 35"
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We are given that G = S + 30. We also know that the total number of coins is 110, so S + G = 110.

Substituting G = S + 30 into the second equation, we get S + (S + 30) = 110. Combining like terms, we get 2S + 30 = 110.

Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2S = 80. Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 40.

Now that we know S = 40, we can find G by substituting S into the equation G = S + 30. G = 40 + 30 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to first determine how many jewels Aaron has. 

Since Raymond has 40 jewels, half of Raymond's jewels would be 40 / 2 = 20. 

Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total points scored by Mike, we need to calculate the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes separately, and then add them together.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which is 1. Then, we add this to the original 4 points to get the total points scored in the second 20 minutes: 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The total points scored by Mike is 9."
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to first determine how many yogurts he eats in 30 days and then calculate the cost.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. In 30 days, he will eat 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The sale is 4 yogurts for $5.00. To find the cost of one yogurt, we divide the total cost by the number of yogurts: $5.00 / 4 = $1.25 per yogurt.

Now, we multiply the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days by the cost of one yogurt: 60 * $1.25 = $75.00.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To find out how many Lego sets John has left, we first need to determine how much money he made from selling the Lego sets and how much he spent on video games.

John sells 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is:
13 * 15 = 195 dollars

He then buys 8 video games for $20 each, so the total amount of money he spent is:
8 * 20 = 160 dollars

Since he had $5 left after buying the video games, we can find out how much money he had before buying the video games by adding the $5 to the amount he spent:
195 - 160 = 35 dollars

However, this is the amount of money he had before buying the video games, not the amount he made from selling the Lego sets. Since he spent $160 on video games, we need to subtract this from the total amount he made to find out how much he had left from the Lego sales:
195 - 160 = 35 dollars

This means that John had $35 left from the Lego sales. Since he sold all his Lego sets for $15 each, we can find out how many sets he sold by dividing the amount of money he had left by the price per set:
35 / 15 = 2.33

However, since John can't sell a fraction of a Lego set, this means he sold 2 sets and had $5 left. Since he started with 13 sets, we can find out how many sets he has left by subtracting the number of sets he sold from the total number of sets:
13 - 2 = 11

The final answer is: 11"
"To find John's running speed, we first need to calculate the total hours he runs per week. 

He runs 3 hours on the first day. The other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours per day. 

So, the total hours he runs per week is 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours.

Since John runs 60 miles a week, we can find his speed by dividing the total miles by the total hours: 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's walking speed. Since she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, and she can skip at 3 miles per hour, we can find her running speed by multiplying her skipping speed by 2. 

Her running speed = 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour.

Since she can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, we can find her walking speed by dividing her running speed by 4.

Her walking speed = 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, we know that she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, in 6 hours, she will spend 2 hours running and 4 hours walking.

Distance traveled while running = speed * time = 6 * 2 = 12 miles
Distance traveled while walking = speed * time = 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles

Total distance traveled = 12 + 6 = 18 miles

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone.
2. Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.

Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, we can calculate Ben's iPhone age as follows:
Ben's iPhone age = 2 * Suzy's iPhone age
Ben's iPhone age = 2 * 1
Ben's iPhone age = 2 years

Now, we know that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone.
Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * Ben's iPhone age
Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * 2
Brandon's iPhone age = 8 years

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone and then subtract the dragon's reach from that distance.

When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. Since she can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, she can throw it 3 * 400 = 1200 feet with the gemstone.

The dragon's reach is 1000 feet, so Polly can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet outside of the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the total number of pieces of pie that were taken by the guests, we need to first find the total number of pieces of pie that were available. Since Grandma Jones cut each pie into 8 pieces and she baked 5 pies, the total number of pieces is 5 * 8 = 40.

Since there were 14 pieces of pie remaining at the end of the evening, the number of pieces taken by the guests is the difference between the total number of pieces and the remaining pieces. 

Total pieces = 40
Remaining pieces = 14
Pieces taken by the guests = Total pieces - Remaining pieces
Pieces taken by the guests = 40 - 14
Pieces taken by the guests = 26

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to determine how many calories you have left to consume. 

Your daily calorie target is 2000, and you have already consumed 1800 calories. 

2000 (daily target) - 1800 (already consumed) = 200 calories left

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, we can divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving to find out how many servings you can eat.

200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, we can multiply the number of servings by the weight of the bag to find out how many grams you can eat.

0.8 servings * 300g = 240g

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's find the total cost. Since one pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00, and Charlie makes 10 candles from one pound of beeswax, the cost per candle is $1.00. 

Now, let's find the total cost for 20 candles: 
Total cost = cost per candle * number of candles
Total cost = $1.00 * 20
Total cost = $20.00

Next, let's find the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles:
Total revenue = price per candle * number of candles
Total revenue = $2.00 * 20
Total revenue = $40.00

Now, let's find the net profit:
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply it by the average time it takes to write an article (4 hours).

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. To find 2/5 of 5, we multiply 5 by 2/5:
5 * (2/5) = 2
So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days:
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours

"To find the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased, we need to determine how many Post-it notes she had after buying the package and before placing any on the cups.

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes. After purchasing a package, she had 80 + x Post-it notes, where x is the number of Post-it notes in the package. After placing a Post-it note on each of the 220 cups, she had 80 + x - 220 Post-it notes remaining.

We are given that she had 23 Post-it notes remaining. So, we can set up the equation:

80 + x - 220 = 23

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 140 = 23

Adding 140 to both sides, we get:

x = 163

Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased is 163.

The final answer is: 163"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. To find the number of blue ties, we divide the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie: 200 / 40 = 5 blue ties.

2. Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he buys 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

3. The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. This means the cost of each red tie is 1.5 times the cost of each blue tie. Since each blue tie costs $40, each red tie costs 1.5 * 40 = $60.

4. To find the total amount spent on red ties, we multiply the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie: 10 * 60 = $600.

5. To find the total amount spent on ties, we add the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties: 200 + 600 = $800.

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches, since the pieces are 6 inches long. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so the total length of the wire in inches is 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.

Now, we can divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find the number of pieces: 48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces.

"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs produced per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find the total number of eggs produced per week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of eggs produced per day by 7:

252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Since Lloyd sells eggs by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so:

1764 eggs/week / 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen/week

Now, we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen to find the total weekly revenue:

147 dozen/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

"To find the total time Tom's ship takes to travel from 1 to 4 PM and back, we need to calculate the time taken for each leg of the journey separately.

First, let's find the time taken to travel from 1 to 4 PM. Since the speed is 10 miles per hour, we can use the formula time = distance / speed. However, the distance is not given, but we can find it by subtracting the initial time from the final time. 

Assuming the time from 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours, the distance traveled is 10 miles per hour * 3 hours = 30 miles.

Now, let's find the time taken to travel back. The speed is 6 miles per hour, and the distance is the same, 30 miles. Using the formula time = distance / speed, we get time = 30 miles / 6 miles per hour = 5 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much weight the comic books weigh in total. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and Uriah removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * (1/4) = 7.5 pounds.

Since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, and the comic books already weigh 7.5 pounds, the remaining weight that needs to be removed from the toys is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so to find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / (1/2) = 7.5 * 2 = 15.

"To find the revenue earned by the mechanic on each day, we need to calculate the total revenue from truck tires and car tires separately for both days.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360. The revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160. The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires. The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480. Since there are no truck tires, the total revenue on Friday is $480.

To find the day with higher revenue, we compare the revenues: $520 (Thursday) and $480 (Friday). Thursday has higher revenue.

Now, to find how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we subtract the lower revenue from the higher revenue: $520 - $480 = $40.

The cost of the material is $500.
The cost of the jeweler is $800.

Total cost before insurance = $500 + $800 = $1300

The insurance cost is 10% of the total cost before insurance. To find 10% of $1300, we multiply $1300 by 0.1.

Insurance cost = $1300 * 0.1 = $130

Total amount Janet paid = Total cost before insurance + Insurance cost

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the annual pension for the first 20 years and the annual pension for the next 10 years.

For the first 20 years, Marcy gets a fixed annual pension of $50,000.

For the next 10 years, she gets 5% of the value of the pension per year. To find the value of the pension, we need to calculate the total amount she would have received in 20 years. Since it's a fixed annual pension, we can use the formula for the future value of a fixed annuity:

FV = PMT * [(1 + r)^n - 1] / r

where FV is the future value, PMT is the annual payment, r is the interest rate (which is 0 in this case since it's a fixed pension), and n is the number of years.

However, since the pension is fixed, we can simply multiply the annual pension by the number of years to find the total value:

Total value = $50,000 * 20 = $1,000,000

Now, we need to find 5% of this value for each year:

Annual pension for the next 10 years = 0.05 * $1,000,000 = $50,000

So, Marcy's annual pension for the next 10 years will be $50,000.

To find the total annual pension, we need to add the annual pension for the first 20 years and the annual pension for the next 10 years:

Total annual pension = $50,000 + $50,000 = $100,000

"To find the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to calculate the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately and then add them together.

The first half of the year is 6 months, so the amount she paid for the first half of the year is:
$140 * 6 = $840

For the second half of the year, she is charged 10% less than the initial amount. To find the amount she paid for the second half of the year, we need to calculate 10% of the initial amount and subtract it from the initial amount:
10% of $140 = 0.1 * $140 = $14
Amount for the second half of the year = $140 - $14 = $126
The second half of the year is also 6 months, so the amount she paid for the second half of the year is:
$126 * 6 = $756

Now, we add the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year to find the total amount she paid for the streaming service by the end of the year:

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to determine the car's miles per gallon (mpg) rating. We can do this by dividing the distance traveled since the last fill-up (100 miles) by the amount of gas used (4 gallons).

mpg = distance / gas used
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know the car's mpg rating, we can find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a full tank by multiplying the tank capacity (12 gallons) by the mpg rating.

"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to subtract the total amount she received from her weekly allowance from the total amount she has at the end of 8 weeks.

Let's denote the initial amount of money Bailey had as 'x'. 

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so the total amount she received from her allowance is 5 * 8 = $40.

At the end of 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100. This can be represented as the sum of the initial amount she had and the total amount she received from her allowance: x + 40 = 100.

To find the initial amount Bailey had, we need to isolate 'x' in the equation. We can do this by subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation: x = 100 - 40.

The interest charged for each cell phone is 2% of $150, which is 0.02 * $150 = $3.

The total interest charged for 5 cell phones is 5 * $3 = $15.

The total cost of the cell phones with interest is $750 + $15 = $765.

Since Shiela will pay this amount over 3 months, we need to divide the total cost by 3 to find the monthly payment.

The monthly payment is $765 / 3 = $255.

The final answer is: $255"
"To find the total amount Artie will make, we need to calculate the total revenue from each type of flower and then add them together.

First, let's round the prices to the nearest dollar:
- Marigolds: $2.74 ≈ $3
- Petunias: $1.87 ≈ $2
- Begonias: $2.12 ≈ $2

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from each type of flower:
- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3/pot = $36
- Petunias: 9 pots * $2/pot = $18
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2/pot = $34

Now, let's add the total revenue from each type of flower:
$36 + $18 + $34 = $88

The final answer is: $88"
"To find the average square footage of a level, we need to find the total square footage of the sandcastle and divide it by the number of levels.

Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can start with the top level and work our way down. 

The top level has a square footage of 16. 
The second level will have half of 16, which is 8. 
The third level will have half of 8, which is 4. 
The fourth level will have half of 4, which is 2.

Now, we add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30.

There are 4 levels in total. To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels: 30 / 4 = 7.5.

The final answer is: 7.5"
"To find the total number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total number of cups of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year and then divide it by the number of cups in a bag.

First, let's calculate the number of cups the puppy will eat in the first 180 days. Since the puppy eats 1 cup of dog food every day for 180 days, the total number of cups is 1 * 180 = 180 cups.

Next, we need to calculate the number of days the puppy will live after the first 180 days. Since there are 365 days in a year, the puppy will live for 365 - 180 = 185 days after the first 180 days.

Now, we can calculate the number of cups the puppy will eat after the first 180 days. Since the puppy eats 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of its life, the total number of cups is 2 * 185 = 370 cups.

The total number of cups the puppy will eat in the first year is the sum of the cups eaten in the first 180 days and the cups eaten after the first 180 days: 180 + 370 = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags Cecilia will use in the first year is 550 / 110 = 5 bags.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
- Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.
- Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so Raymond does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry.

To find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we subtract the amount David does from the amount Raymond does: 200 - 100 = 100.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the better price, we need to calculate the cost per flower for each package option.

For the package of 3 flowers for $2.50, the cost per flower is:
$2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower

For the package of 2 flowers for $1, the cost per flower is:
$1 / 2 = $0.5 per flower

Since $0.5 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers for $1 is the better option.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price:
18 flowers * $0.5 per flower = $9

Next, let's calculate the total cost of buying 18 flowers at the more expensive option:
Since 18 is not a multiple of 3, we need to find the closest multiple of 3 that is less than or equal to 18, which is 18. To find the number of packages of 3 flowers, we divide 18 by 3:
18 / 3 = 6
So, Vincent would need to buy 6 packages of 3 flowers.
6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15
Since 18 is not a multiple of 3, we need to find the remaining number of flowers that are not in a package of 3. This is 18 - (6 * 3) = 0. However, since we can't buy a fraction of a package, we need to buy one more package of 3 flowers to have 18 flowers. 
6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15
1 package * $2.50 per package = $2.50
Total cost = $15 + $2.50 = $17.50

Now, let's calculate the savings:
$17.50 - $9 = $8.50

The final answer is: $8.50"
"To find the cost of the grooming after the discount, we need to calculate 30% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

The original price is $100. 
30% of $100 is 0.3 * 100 = $30.

Now, subtract the discount from the original price: $100 - $30 = $70.

The final cost of the grooming is $70.

$70"
"To find out how much water the girls got, we need to calculate 1/6 of 24 liters. 

1/6 of 24 liters = (1/6) * 24 = 4 liters

Since there are two girls, they each got 4 liters of water. So, the total amount of water the girls got is 2 * 4 = 8 liters.

Now, we subtract the amount of water the girls got and the amount the boy got from the total amount of water. 

Total water initially = 24 liters
Water taken by girls = 8 liters
Water taken by boy = 6 liters

Water left = Total water initially - (Water taken by girls + Water taken by boy)
= 24 - (8 + 6)
= 24 - 14
= 10 liters

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many stickers Charlie has left, we need to calculate the total number of stickers he had initially and then subtract the number of stickers he gave away or used.

Initially, Charlie had 10 stickers.

He bought 21 stickers from the store, so now he has 10 + 21 = 31 stickers.

He got 23 stickers for his birthday, so now he has 31 + 23 = 54 stickers.

Then, he gave 9 stickers to his sister, so now he has 54 - 9 = 45 stickers.

Finally, he used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so now he has 45 - 28 = 17 stickers.

Therefore, Charlie has 17 stickers left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To find Alex's weight, we need to calculate 4 times Grace's weight and then subtract 2 pounds from that result. 

First, we multiply Grace's weight by 4: 125 * 4 = 500 pounds. 

Then, we subtract 2 pounds from that result: 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.

Now, we add Grace's weight to Alex's weight to find their combined weight: 125 + 498 = 623 pounds.

The final answer is: 623"
"To find the total number of thorns, we need to multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush, and then multiply that result by the number of thorns per rose.

Number of rose bushes: 3
Number of roses per bush: 25
Number of thorns per rose: 8

First, multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush: 3 * 25 = 75
Then, multiply the result by the number of thorns per rose: 75 * 8 = 600

The total number of thorns is 600."
"Let's denote the number of games the team lost as L and the number of games they won as W. We are given that W = L + 8. We also know that the total number of games played is 22, so W + L = 22.

We can substitute W from the first equation into the second equation: (L + 8) + L = 22. Combining like terms, we get 2L + 8 = 22.

Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2L = 14. Dividing both sides by 2, we get L = 7.

Now that we know L, we can find W by substituting L into the first equation: W = L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the total number of years Gene has been vacationing and multiply it by the number of vacations he goes on per year.

Gene is 34 years old and has been vacationing since he was 23, so he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since he goes on 4 vacations a year, the total number of quilt blocks is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 quilt blocks.

The final answer is: 44"
"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of times it rang each time it went off and add them together.

The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.

The second time, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.

The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we add the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her salary after the 5th year and then calculate the increase for the next three years.

Initially, Sylvie's salary is $600. 

After 5 years, her salary will increase by 10% of $600 for each year. 
Year 1: $600 * 0.10 = $60, $600 + $60 = $660
Year 2: $660 * 0.10 = $66, $660 + $66 = $726
Year 3: $726 * 0.10 = $72.60, $726 + $72.60 = $798.60
Year 4: $798.60 * 0.10 = $79.86, $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46
Year 5: $878.46 * 0.10 = $87.85, $878.46 + $87.85 = $966.31

Now, we need to calculate the increase for the next three years. 
Year 6: $966.31 * 0.10 = $96.63, $966.31 + $96.63 = $1062.94
Year 7: $1062.94 * 0.10 = $106.29, $1062.94 + $106.29 = $1169.23
Year 8: $1169.23 * 0.10 = $116.92, $1169.23 + $116.92 = $1286.15

Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is $1286.15."
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as H. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, the number of copies Marilyn sold is 10H.

We know that the total number of copies sold is 88,000, which is the sum of the copies sold by Marilyn and Harald. So, we can write the equation:

H + 10H = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11H = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

H = 88,000 / 11
H = 8,000

The final answer is: 8000"
"To find out how many gift bags Christina needs, we first need to calculate the number of guests who will actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, we can find the number of guests who will attend by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of invited guests.

Number of invited guests = 16
Number of guests who don't show up = 1/4 * 16 = 4
Number of guests who will attend = 16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we can multiply the number of guests who will attend by 0.75 to find the total number of gift bags needed.

Number of gift bags needed = 12 * 0.75 = 9

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag.

Cost per gift bag = $2
Total cost = 9 * $2 = $18

First, let's find the amount eaten by adults: 20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs

Since children eat half as much as adults, the amount eaten by children is half of the amount eaten by adults: 200 lbs / 2 = 100 lbs

Now, we add the amount eaten by adults and children to find the total amount needed: 200 lbs + 100 lbs = 300 lbs

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 300 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can set up an equation:

Time taken by Gerald = Time taken by Lee + 2 seconds
Time taken by Gerald = 38 + 2
Time taken by Gerald = 40 seconds

Now, we know that Gerald's speed improved by 10% after his diet change. To find his new time, we need to calculate 10% of his original time and subtract it from his original time.

10% of 40 seconds = 0.1 * 40 = 4 seconds
New time taken by Gerald = Original time - (10% of original time)
New time taken by Gerald = 40 - 4
New time taken by Gerald = 36 seconds

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.
2. There are two cats for every dog.
3. The number of dogs is 60.

Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, the number of cats can be calculated as follows:
Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
= 2 * 60
= 120

Now, we know the number of dogs and cats. The combined number of dogs and cats is:
Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 60 + 120
= 180

According to the first point, the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats:
Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
= 180 - 12
= 168

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats:
Total number of pets = Number of rabbits + Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 168 + 60 + 120
= 348

"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls and then subtract the number of girls in the girl scout.

First, let's find the number of boys and girls. We know that 2/5 of the students are boys. 

Number of boys = (2/5) * 200 = 80

Since the total number of students is 200, the number of girls can be found by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students.

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 200 - 80
= 120

Now, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = (2/3) * Number of girls
= (2/3) * 120
= 80

Now, to find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
= 120 - 80
= 40

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we first need to determine the total volume of the tomatoes before they were cooked. Since the sauce made 32 ounces and it's half the volume of the tomatoes, the total volume of the tomatoes must be 32 * 2 = 64 ounces.

Since each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces, we can divide the total volume of the tomatoes by the volume of each can to find out how many cans were used: 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes used is 4 cans * 3 tomatoes/can = 12 tomatoes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as x.

We know that 5 cars took an exit, so the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the original number of cars minus the cars that took an exit: 30 - 5 = 25.

We also know that 20 more cars drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes. Therefore, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes: x + 20 = 25.

Now, we can solve for x:

x + 20 = 25
x = 25 - 20
x = 5

However, this is the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes, not the first 15 minutes. To find the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to subtract the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes from the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam: 25 - 20 = 5.

But this is the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes, not the first 15 minutes.

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we need to first determine how many potted plants she has initially and then subtract the number of plants she gives away.

Initially, Mary has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so she has a total of 2 * 40 = 80 potted plants.

She received 18 new potted plants from the nursery, so now she has 80 + 18 = 98 potted plants.

Tomorrow, she will give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges, so she will give away 40 potted plants.

To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we subtract the number of plants she gives away from the total number of plants she has: 98 - 40 = 58.

The final answer is: 58"
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and add them up.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend, which is 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. Since the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

Now, let's add up the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell: 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175.

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read in total, we need to add up the pages from all his textbooks. 

4 pages (Science) + 20 pages (Social Studies) + 7 pages (History) + 8 pages (Geography) = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, we need to subtract those from the total to find out how many pages are left to read.

39 pages - 15 pages = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average per day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days.

24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately and then add them together.

On weekdays, John drinks 4 glasses of water (one with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and one before bed). Since there are 5 weekdays, he drinks 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 3 glasses of water (one with breakfast, lunch, and one before bed) and 1 glass of soda with dinner. So, he drinks 3 glasses of water on each weekend day. Since there are 2 weekend days, he drinks 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water on weekends.

Now, we add the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays and weekends: 20 (weekdays) + 6 (weekends) = 26.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find the time it takes for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to determine how many 3-mile sections the city is divided into and then multiply that by the time it takes to cover each section.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

To find the number of 3-mile sections, we divide the total distance by the length of each section: 
42 miles / 3 miles per section = 14 sections

Now, we multiply the number of sections by the time it takes to cover each section:
14 sections * 10 minutes per section = 140 minutes

The final answer is: 140"
"To find out how many pieces are left to be placed, we first need to determine how many pieces Poppy and her mom have placed.

Poppy places a quarter of the 1000 pieces, which is 1000 * (1/4) = 250 pieces.

The remaining pieces after Poppy's turn are 1000 - 250 = 750.

Then, her mom places a third of the remaining 750 pieces, which is 750 * (1/3) = 250 pieces.

The number of pieces her mom placed is subtracted from the remaining pieces, so 750 - 250 = 500 pieces are left to be placed.

The final answer is: 500"
"To find the total number of cookies both Cody and Amir eat, we first need to determine how many cookies Cody eats. Since Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, and Amir eats 5 cookies, we can multiply the number of cookies Amir eats by 3 to find the number of cookies Cody eats.

Cody eats 3 * 5 = 15 cookies.

Now, to find the total number of cookies both of them eat, we add the number of cookies Amir eats to the number of cookies Cody eats.

Total cookies = 5 (Amir's cookies) + 15 (Cody's cookies) = 20

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to find the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The dimensions of the box are given as 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick. This means that the inner dimensions of the box will be (5-2) inches by (6-2) inches by (4-2) inches, since 1 inch is subtracted from each side for the wall thickness.

So, the inner dimensions of the box are 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches.

The formula to find the volume of a rectangular prism is length * width * height. 

Inner volume of one box = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes = 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 2 episodes of a 1-hour show, which is a total of 2 hours.

On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's call the number of episodes he watched 'x'. Since each episode is 30 minutes, the total time he spent watching on Wednesday is 0.5x hours.

On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes of TV, which is 1.5 hours.

On Friday, he watched 2 episodes of a 1-hour show, which is a total of 2 hours.

The total time Frankie spent watching TV is 7 hours. We can set up an equation to represent this:

2 (Monday and Tuesday) + 0.5x (Wednesday) + 1.5 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 7

Combine like terms:

2 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7

Combine the constants:

5.5 + 0.5x = 7

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

0.5x = 1.5

Divide both sides by 0.5:

x = 3

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x. Since Henry wants to make twice as many as he did last year, he plans to bake 2x cookies this year.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. This can be represented by the equation: 2x + 15 - 5 = 110.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 10 = 110.

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation, we get 2x = 100.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get x = 50.

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To find the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of gas without the rewards, and then subtract the cashback amount.

The cost of gas per gallon is $3.00, and the person is buying 10 gallons. 

Total cost of gas = cost per gallon * number of gallons
Total cost of gas = $3.00 * 10
Total cost of gas = $30.00

The cashback reward is $0.20 per gallon, and the person is buying 10 gallons.

Total cashback = cashback per gallon * number of gallons
Total cashback = $0.20 * 10
Total cashback = $2.00

Now, we subtract the total cashback from the total cost of gas to find the final cost.

Final cost = Total cost of gas - Total cashback
Final cost = $30.00 - $2.00
Final cost = $28.00

The final answer is: $28.00"
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by each person, we need to multiply the width and length of each roll-up. 

Beatrice's roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 rolls up long, so the total number of roll-ups is 2 * 24 = 48.

Marcell's roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 rolls up long, so the total number of roll-ups is 3 * 14 = 42.

To find the average number of roll-ups eaten, we need to add the total number of roll-ups eaten by each person and divide by 2. 

Total roll-ups eaten = 48 + 42 = 90
Average roll-ups eaten = 90 / 2 = 45

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rows in 64 seconds, and then multiply that by the amount of water taken on per set.

First, let's find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rows in 16 seconds. Since it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find the rate of rowing as follows:

Rate = Distance / Time = 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet/second

Now, we can find the number of sets of 10 feet she rows in 64 seconds:

Number of sets = Total time / Time per set = 64 seconds / 16 seconds = 4 sets

Since each set takes on 2 liters of water, the total water taken on is:

Total water = Number of sets * Water per set = 4 sets * 2 liters/set = 8 liters

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to calculate the total number of lessons and then multiply it by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
2. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.
3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

From point 1, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, then Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

From point 2, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This means that the number of birds in Jamal's photograph is 300 / 50 = 6.

"To find the profit, we first need to calculate the total cost and total selling price of the lumber.

The total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 = $100.
The total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80.
The total cost of all the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15.
The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24.

The total selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $15 = $150.
The total selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $24 = $120.
The total selling price of all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total selling price minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of ratios and proportions. The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, and the total number of parts in the ratio is 7 + 13 = 20.

We are given that the total number of teaspoons of sugar and water used is 120. Since the ratio of sugar to the total is 7:20, we can set up a proportion to find the number of teaspoons of sugar used.

Let x be the number of teaspoons of sugar used. Then, the number of teaspoons of water used is 120 - x.

The ratio of sugar to the total is 7:20, so we can set up the following proportion:

7/20 = x / (120 - x)

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

7(120 - x) = 20x

Expanding the left-hand side, we get:

840 - 7x = 20x

Adding 7x to both sides, we get:

840 = 27x

Dividing both sides by 27, we get:

x = 840 / 27

x = 31.11

So, Katy used approximately 31.11 teaspoons of sugar.

The final answer is: 31.11"
"To find the total amount John paid, we need to calculate the cost of the shoes for each child and then multiply it by the number of children.

Since John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each child and each pair costs $60, the cost for each child is 2 * $60 = $120.

Now, we multiply the cost for each child by the number of children: $120 * 3 = $360.

Therefore, John paid $360 in total.

The final answer is: $360"
"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we first need to find the total number of vehicles that were already at the port on the first day. 

The customs officer counted 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles at the port on the second day is 30. To find the number of vehicles that were brought in on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers brought in on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles brought in on the second day by 5: 20 / 5 = 4.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Lylah's salary four years ago. 

Let's assume Lylah's salary four years ago was 'x'. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can express Adrien's salary as 1.3x. We are given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, so we can set up the equation:

1.3x = 40000

To find 'x', we can divide both sides by 1.3:

x = 40000 / 1.3
x = 30769.23

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30769.23.

Now, we need to find Adrien's salary four years later. We are given that his salary increased by 40% of his original salary. We can express this as:

New salary = Original salary + (40% of Original salary)
= 40000 + (0.4 * 40000)
= 40000 + 16000
= 56000

Now, we need to find Lylah's salary four years later. Since their salaries increased simultaneously, we can assume the percentage increase in their salaries is the same. We can express Lylah's new salary as:

New salary = Original salary + (30% of Original salary)
= 30769.23 + (0.3 * 30769.23)
= 30769.23 + 9230.77
= 39999.99

Now, we can find the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later:

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
= 56000 + 39999.99
= 95999.99

The final answer is: $95999.99"

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So, the number of sheets he uses in a week is:

2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the number of sheets used in a week by 4 to get the total number of sheets used in a month:

60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, so Kael brought 2 * 5 = 10 apples. 
Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, so Kael brought 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

Now, we can find the total number of fruits each person brought: 
Morisette brought 5 + 8 = 13 fruits.
Kael brought 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.

The total number of fruits they have is 13 + 14 = 27.

"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate the hours she slept on each day and add them up.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

The rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday) she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours she slept for each period:

- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday and Wednesday: 2 days * 6 hours = 12 hours
- Thursday to Sunday: 5 days * 7 hours = 35 hours

Now, let's add up the total hours: 8 + 12 + 35 = 55

"To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour.

First, let's calculate the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's calculate the remaining time after 3 hours:
Total time = 7 hours
Time already run = 3 hours
Remaining time = Total time - Time already run
Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours
Remaining time = 4 hours

Next, let's calculate the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distances from both parts to find the total distance:
Total distance = Distance at 10 mph + Distance at 5 mph
Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total distance = 50 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many letters Jennie stamped and then subtract that from the total number of letters that were already stamped when she began.

Let's denote the total number of letters needing stamps as L. We know that Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters, so the number of letters she stamped is L/3.

We are given that after Jennie stamped the letters, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This means that the number of letters already stamped before Jennie started is 30 - L/3.

However, we also know that the total number of letters needing stamps is L, and the number of letters already stamped before Jennie started is also L - (L/3) = 2L/3.

Since the total number of letters needing stamps is 60, we can set up the equation:

L = 60

Now, we can find the number of letters already stamped before Jennie started by substituting L = 60 into the expression 2L/3:

2L/3 = 2(60)/3
= 120/3
= 40

So, there were 40 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

The final answer is: 40"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as 'x'. 

Initially, Julia had 0 spoons. After buying a package, she had x spoons. Then, her husband gave her 5 more spoons, so she had x + 5 spoons. 

After using 3 spoons, she had (x + 5) - 3 = x + 2 spoons left. 

Later, when she set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons. This means that x + 2 + 12 = 12, since the 12 spoons are the remaining spoons after using 3. 

However, this equation doesn't make sense because it implies that x + 2 + 12 = 12, which means x + 2 = 0, and x would be -2, which is not possible since you can't have a negative number of spoons.

Let's re-evaluate the situation. We know that after using 3 spoons, Julia had 12 spoons left. This means that before using the 3 spoons, she had 12 + 3 = 15 spoons. 

Since her husband gave her 5 spoons, she had 15 - 5 = 10 spoons before her husband gave her the spoons. 

So, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is 10.

"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages. 

First, let's find the number of fish sausages. Since Dylan bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, we can represent the number of fish sausages as 38 + 6 = 44.

Now, we can add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages to find the total number of sausages: 38 (chicken sausages) + 44 (fish sausages) = 82.

The final answer is: 82"
"To find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we need to first find the number of friends Amy has. Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily has 50 friends, we can calculate Amy's friends by adding 20 to Lily's friends.

Amy's friends = Lily's friends + 20
Amy's friends = 50 + 20
Amy's friends = 70

Now, to find the total number of friends they have together, we add the number of friends Lily and Amy have.

Total friends = Lily's friends + Amy's friends
Total friends = 50 + 70
Total friends = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to determine the cost of each item and then multiply it by the quantity.

Let's start by finding the cost of a watermelon. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs $15, the cost of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45.

Next, we need to find the cost of an orange. An orange costs 5 dollars less than what a watermelon costs, so the cost of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each item:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is the sum of the costs of all items: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

The final answer is: $880"
"To find the profit made by the hospital, we need to calculate the total time spent by doctors and the total amount charged to patients, then subtract the cost from the revenue.

First, let's calculate the total time spent by doctors. The hospital sees 500 people a day, and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. 

Total time spent by doctors = 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours.

Total time spent by doctors = 12000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The doctors charge $150 an hour, so the total cost to the hospital is:

Total cost = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30000

Now, let's calculate the total amount charged to patients. The hospital charges $200 an hour, and the total time spent is 200 hours.

Total revenue = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40000

The profit made by the hospital is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost.

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
= $40000 - $30000
= $10000

The final answer is: $10000"
"To find the number of elves left, we first need to calculate the number of elves that quit after being vomited on. Since a third of the elves quit, we can calculate this as follows:

60 (initial elves) * 1/3 = 20 elves quit

Now, we subtract the elves that quit from the initial number of elves:

60 - 20 = 40 elves left

Then, 10 more elves quit after being kicked, so we subtract those from the remaining elves:

40 - 10 = 30 elves left

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total expenditure for the two months, we need to add the expenditure in May and June. 

The expenditure in May was $500. 
The expenditure in June was $60 less than May, so it is $500 - $60 = $440.

Now, we add the expenditures for May and June: $500 + $440 = $940.

"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the total number of rides taken by Pam and Fred and then multiply it by the cost of each ride.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she took a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he took a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

The total number of rides taken by both Pam and Fred is 4 + 6 = 10 rides.

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is 10 * 6 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we first need to determine how many miles he walked on Tuesday. 

Since Walt walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday, and he walked 4 miles on Monday, we can calculate the miles walked on Tuesday as 6 * 4 = 24 miles.

Now, we know that the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. We already know that Walt walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage:

Total mileage = 41 miles
Miles walked on Monday and Tuesday = 4 + 24 = 28 miles
Miles walked on Wednesday = Total mileage - Miles walked on Monday and Tuesday
Miles walked on Wednesday = 41 - 28
Miles walked on Wednesday = 13 miles

"To find out how many video games Bobby has, we first need to determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5. 

Brian initially has 20 video games, but he lost 5, so he now has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. To find out how many video games Bobby has, we multiply the number of video games Brian has by 3 and then subtract 5.

3 times the number of video games Brian has is 3 * 15 = 45.

5 fewer than 45 is 45 - 5 = 40.

Bobby has 40 video games.

"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we first need to find the total number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. 

One third of the 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. 
So, the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands = 27 / 3 = 9.

Now, we need to find the number of female unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. 
Two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. 
So, the number of female Scottish unicorns = 2/3 * 9 = 6.

"To find the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we need to calculate the cost of the items, the delivery fee, and the tip, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the items:
- 2 subs for $7.50 each: 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
- 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each: 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
- 2 cookies for $1.00 each: 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
Total cost of items: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, let's calculate the delivery fee:
- 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00

Now, let's add the delivery fee to the total cost of the items:
$20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, let's add the $5.00 tip to the total:
$24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

"To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the total number of questions he completed in each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions in each test.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 

First, let's find out how many questions Mark would have completed in 8 hours at a rate of 5 questions per hour:
8 hours * 5 questions/hour = 40 questions

Since Mark completed 40 questions in 8 hours, he left 75 - 40 = 35 questions incomplete in the first test.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour.

Now, let's find out how many questions Mark would have completed in 6 hours at a rate of 5 questions per hour:
6 hours * 5 questions/hour = 30 questions

Since Mark completed 30 questions in 6 hours, he left 100 - 30 = 70 questions incomplete in the second test.

To find the total number of questions Mark left incomplete, we add the number of incomplete questions from both tests:
35 (incomplete questions from the first test) + 70 (incomplete questions from the second test) = 105

The final answer is: 105"

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine the total number of semi-automatic cars. 

Total number of cars = 20
Number of automatic cars = 12
Number of manual cars = 4

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Number of automatic cars + Number of manual cars)
= 20 - (12 + 4)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100

"Let's denote the number of baby bees as B, the number of worker bees as W, and the number of queens as Q.

We are given that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B.

We are also given that there are twice as many babies as queens, so B = 2Q.

We know that the total number of bees in the hive is 700, so W + B + Q = 700.

Substituting W = 2B and B = 2Q into the total equation, we get 2B + B + Q = 700, which simplifies to 3B + Q = 700.

Since B = 2Q, we can substitute this into the equation to get 3(2Q) + Q = 700, which simplifies to 6Q + Q = 700, or 7Q = 700.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100.

Now that we know Q = 100, we can find B by substituting Q into the equation B = 2Q, which gives B = 2(100) = 200.

Finally, we can find W by substituting B into the equation W = 2B, which gives W = 2(200) = 400.

"To find out how much money Jordan would earn in one week, we need to calculate the total hours he would work in a week and then multiply it by his hourly wage.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, if he spent his video game time working instead, he would work 2 hours more each day. 

There are 7 days in a week, so the total hours he would work in a week is 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours.

His hourly wage is $10, so the total amount of money he would earn in a week is 14 hours * $10/hour = $140.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of food items and non-food items separately and then add them together.

Food items: milk and eggs
Cost of milk = 2 dollars
Cost of eggs = 3 dollars
Total cost of food items = 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Non-food items: light bulbs, cups, and roach traps
Cost of light bulbs = 3 dollars
Cost of cups = 3 dollars
Cost of roach traps = 4 dollars
Total cost of non-food items = 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount:
Tax amount = 10% of 10 dollars = 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar

Now, we add the tax amount to the total cost of non-food items:
Total cost of non-food items with tax = 10 + 1 = 11 dollars

Now, we add the total cost of food items and the total cost of non-food items with tax:
Total cost = 5 + 11 = 16 dollars

"To calculate the total profit, we first need to determine the total income and total expenses. 

Kim has 3 current clients and 5 potential clients, making a total of 8 clients. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. 

Total bottles of bleach needed per week = 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed per week = 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

The cost of bleach per week = 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
The cost of cloths per week = 8 packs * $5/pack = $40

Total expenses per week = $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72

Since Kim's total income per week is $92, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total income.

Profit per week = Total income - Total expenses
Profit per week = $92 - $72
Profit per week = $20

"To find the total number of pineapples John has, we multiply the number of hectares by the number of pineapples per hectare. 

10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we need to find out how many 3-month periods are in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so we divide 12 by 3 to get the number of harvests in a year.

12 months / 3 months/harvest = 4 harvests

Now, we multiply the total number of pineapples by the number of harvests in a year to find the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year.

1000 pineapples * 4 harvests = 4000 pineapples

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return. So, 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees return.
3. The number of bees that have left but not returned is 30 - 15 = 15 bees.
4. In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the ones that left in the first 6 hours fly from the hive and leave. So, 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave.
5. The total number of bees that left but not returned is now 15 (from step 3) + 60 (from step 4) = 75 bees.
6. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. So, 75 bees return.

The cost of the child ticket is $10, and the cost of the adult ticket is $12. 

Total cost = cost of child ticket + cost of adult ticket
Total cost = $10 + $12
Total cost = $22

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, we need to add this to the total cost to find the amount she gave the cashier.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many friends Dorothy has. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy and Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship.

Let's denote the number of friends Dorothy has as 'x'. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can write the equation as:

3x = 12

To find the value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 12 / 3
x = 4

So, Dorothy has 4 friends on Facebook.

Now, we know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Since Dorothy has 4 friends, we can multiply 4 by 4 to find the number of friends James has:

James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

"To find out who wins the race and how long the winner will wait for the loser, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distances to the same unit. Since Steve's speed is given in feet per minute, we'll convert the distances to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile, so:

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:

Steve's time: distance / speed = 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: distance / speed = 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes to get home and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve wins the race. To find out how long the winner will wait for the loser, we subtract the winner's time from the loser's time:

Waiting time = Tim's time - Steve's time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

"To find the total amount of money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating all the tires.

First, let's calculate the cost of inflating the bicycle tires. Each bicycle has 2 tires, and there were 5 bicycles. So, the total number of bicycle tires is 5 * 2 = 10. The cost of inflating each tire is 25 cents, so the total cost of inflating the bicycle tires is 10 * 25 cents = 250 cents.

Next, let's calculate the cost of inflating the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and there were 3 tricycles. So, the total number of tricycle tires is 3 * 3 = 9. The cost of inflating each tire is 25 cents, so the total cost of inflating the tricycle tires is 9 * 25 cents = 225 cents.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of inflating the unicycle tire. A unicycle has 1 tire, and there was 1 unicycle. So, the total number of unicycle tires is 1 * 1 = 1. The cost of inflating each tire is 25 cents, so the total cost of inflating the unicycle tire is 1 * 25 cents = 25 cents.

Now, let's add up the total cost of inflating all the tires: 250 cents + 225 cents + 25 cents = 500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 500 cents / 100 = 5 dollars.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of french fries as x.

1. Dave ate 14 fries, so the remaining fries are x - 14.
2. The seagull ate half of the 14 fries Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries. So, the seagull ate a total of 7 fries. Now, the remaining fries are (x - 14) - 7 = x - 21.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries. Now, the remaining fries are (x - 21) - 9 = x - 30.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, which is (2/3)(x - 30). The remaining fries are (x - 30) - (2/3)(x - 30) = (1/3)(x - 30).
5. Ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 5 fries behind. So, (1/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5.
6. Now, let's solve for x: (1/3)(x - 30) = 6
   Multiply both sides by 3: x - 30 = 18
   Add 30 to both sides: x = 48

"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of the baguettes from feet to inches, since the lengths of the rolls and croissants are given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so each baguette is 2 * 12 = 24 inches long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches

Now, let's add the lengths together: 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he's running back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. Adding the initial 200 yards, Kelly's total distance is 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Since 3000 is greater than 2920, Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

"To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin, we need to add the number of starfish, sea horses, and clownfish he caught. 

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 

Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Now, let's find the number of fish caught by Locsin. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Now, let's find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin. 

Total fish caught = Total fish caught by Anakin + Total fish caught by Locsin
Total fish caught = 19 + 13
Total fish caught = 32

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. The price of the bag of marbles increases by 20% every two months, which means the price at the end of each two-month period is 120% of the price at the beginning of that period.

Let's break it down:

- After 2 months, the price is 1.2 times the original price (120% of $20 = $24).
- After 4 months, the price is 1.2 times the price at the end of 2 months, which is 1.2 * $24 = $28.8.
- After 6 months, the price is 1.2 times the price at the end of 4 months, which is 1.2 * $28.8 = $34.56.
- We can continue this pattern for 36 months.

However, a more efficient way to solve this problem is to use the formula for compound interest or exponential growth:

A = P * (1 + r)^n

where A is the amount after n periods, P is the principal amount (initial price), r is the growth rate (20% or 0.2 as a decimal), and n is the number of periods.

In this case, P = $20, r = 0.2, and n = 18 (since 36 months / 2 months per period = 18 periods).

A = $20 * (1 + 0.2)^18
A ≈ $20 * 7.643
A ≈ $154.86

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the difference in income between doing the taxes herself and hiring an accountant. 

If Jackie does the taxes herself, she'll lose $35/hour in missed income for 3 hours of freelance work. So, the total income lost is 3 hours * $35/hour = $105.

The cost of hiring the accountant is $90.

Now, let's calculate the difference in income: 
Difference = Cost of hiring the accountant - Income lost by doing taxes herself
Difference = $90 - $105
Difference = -$15

Since the difference is negative, it means that hiring the accountant will result in a loss of $15.

The final answer is: $-15"
"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to subtract the total cost of the computer accessories from her budget.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the accessories:

- Computer: €1090
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1323

Now, let's subtract the total cost from Elvira's budget:

Budget = €1500
Total cost = €1323

Money left for clothing = Budget - Total cost
= €1500 - €1323
= €177

The final answer is: €177"
"To find out how many times Sandra has to babysit, we need to determine how many eggs she needs in total to make 15 Spanish flans and then divide that by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job.

Since each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs, the total number of eggs needed for 15 flans is 3 * 15 = 45 eggs.

Sandra gets 9 eggs every time she babysits. To find out how many times she needs to babysit, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysit: 45 / 9 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. We are given that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write an equation:

S = 2B

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This means that in 2 years, Seth's age will be S + 2 and Brooke's age will be B + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write another equation:

S + 2 + B + 2 = 28

Combine like terms:

S + B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

S + B = 24

Now we can substitute the first equation (S = 2B) into this equation:

2B + B = 24

Combine like terms:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B into the first equation:

S = 2B
S = 2(8)
S = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to first determine what ""twice the money Ethel has"" is. Since Ethel has $8, twice that amount would be 2 * 8 = 16.

Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has, so we add 2 to the result we found: 16 + 2 = 18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the miles he walks on weekdays and weekends separately and then add them together.

Pancho walks 20 miles a day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, the total miles he walks on weekdays is 20 * 5 = 100 miles.

On weekends, he walks 10 miles a day for 2 days. So, the total miles he walks on weekends is 10 * 2 = 20 miles.

Now, we add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends to get the total miles walked in a week: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants separately and then add them together.

The cost of the hat is given as $25.

The cost of the jacket is three times as much as the hat, so it is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. The average cost of the pants is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

The final answer is: $150"
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each group and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of legs for the spiders: 80 spiders * 8 legs/spider = 640 legs.

Next, let's calculate the number of legs for the insects: 90 insects * 6 legs/insect = 540 legs.

Then, let's calculate the number of legs for the mutant invertebrates: 3 invertebrates * 10 legs/invertebrate = 30 legs.

Now, let's add the number of legs for each group together: 640 legs + 540 legs + 30 legs = 1210 legs.

The final answer is: 1210"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red.
2. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four.
3. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, and Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.

From point 3, we know Sally Four is 8 years old. 

From point 2, we can deduce that Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

From point 1, we know Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of three birds: Sally Four (8), Granny Red (16), and Sally Two (19). 

The only bird left is Sally, but we don't have any information about Sally's age. However, the question asks for the total age of the four birds, and we have three of them. Since Sally is not mentioned in the context of the other birds' ages, we can assume Sally is a different bird from Sally Two, Sally Four, and Sally Thirtytwo. 

However, since Sally is not mentioned in the context of the other birds' ages, we can assume Sally is a different bird from Sally Two, Sally Four, and Sally Thirtytwo. But since Sally is not mentioned in the context of the other birds' ages, we can assume Sally is a different bird from Sally Two, Sally Four, and Sally Thirtytwo."
"To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to calculate the total monthly payments and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the increased minimum payments for each debt:

- Student loans: $300 * 1.5 = $450
- Credit card: $200 * 1.5 = $300
- Mortgage: $500 * 1.5 = $750

Now, let's add up the increased minimum payments:
$450 + $300 + $750 = $1500

Since Jessica pays this amount every month, we multiply it by 12 to find the total annual payment:
$1500 * 12 = $18,000

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To find the total time it takes Billy to peel and cut all the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes, and then add the time it takes to cut one potato multiplied by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds = 5/60 minutes (converting seconds to minutes)

Total time to peel all potatoes: 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes/potato = 90 minutes
Total time to cut all potatoes: 60 potatoes * (5/60) minutes/potato = 5 minutes

Total time to peel and cut all potatoes: 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

The final answer is: 95"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much they made in total from selling lemonade and then subtract the cost of sugar to find the cost of lemons.

Let's denote the number of gallons as 'g'. Since they get 20 glasses per gallon and sell each glass for $0.50, the total revenue from selling lemonade is 20 * 0.5 * g = 10g dollars.

The cost of making lemonade is $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar per gallon. So, the total cost is 3g + 2g = 5g dollars.

Since they made a profit of $25, we can set up the equation: 10g - 5g = 25.

Simplifying the equation, we get 5g = 25.

Dividing both sides by 5, we get g = 5.

Now that we know they made 5 gallons, we can find the cost of lemons by multiplying the cost per gallon by the number of gallons: 3 * 5 = 15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the number of Chinese participants, we first need to subtract the number of Japanese participants from the total number of participants. 

Total participants = 240
Japanese participants = 80
Chinese participants = Total participants - Japanese participants
Chinese participants = 240 - 80
Chinese participants = 160

Since we know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of girls = Chinese participants - Number of boys
Number of girls = 160 - 60
Number of girls = 100

"To find the amount of money Zaid has left after all expenses and donations, we need to follow the order of operations.

1. Zaid earns 6000$ per month.
2. He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent: 1/4 * 6000 = 1500$
3. He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel: 1/3 * 6000 = 2000$
4. The remaining amount after rent and car fuel is: 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500$
5. He donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity: 1/2 * 2500 = 1250$
6. The remaining amount after donation is: 2500 - 1250 = 1250$
7. He gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$, so the total amount given to them is: 200 + 700 = 900$
8. The remaining amount after giving money to his daughter and wife is: 1250 - 900 = 350$

The final answer is: $350"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Bo has 40 crabs.
- Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.
- Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

To find the total number of crabs the three have together, we add the number of crabs each one has: 40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122.

"To find out how much Lloyd earned in the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd tutored 5 hours at $10 per hour, so his earnings for the first week are:
5 hours * $10/hour = $50

For the second week, Lloyd tutored 8 hours at $10 per hour, so his earnings for the second week are:
8 hours * $10/hour = $80

Now, we add his earnings for both weeks to find the total:

"To find the number of votes the loser got, we first need to find the number of votes the winner got. Since the winner got 3/4 of the votes, we can calculate this as follows:

Winner's votes = (3/4) * Total votes
Winner's votes = (3/4) * 80
Winner's votes = 60

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser got can be found by subtracting the winner's votes from the total votes:

Loser's votes = Total votes - Winner's votes
Loser's votes = 80 - 60
Loser's votes = 20

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses is 4x.

We are also given that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, so the number of pink calla lilies is 5x.

We know that the total number of pink calla lilies is 200, so we can set up the equation 5x = 200 to find the value of x.

Solving for x, we get x = 200 / 5 = 40.

Now that we know the value of x, we can find the number of red roses by multiplying x by 4: 4x = 4 * 40 = 160.

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

From point 3, we know Jan's current age is 30. 

Two years ago, Jan's age would be 30 - 2 = 28.

From point 2, we know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Half of Jan's age two years ago is 28 / 2 = 14. 

So, two years ago, Mark's age was 14 + 5 = 19.

Since Mark's age two years ago was 19, his current age is 19 + 2 = 21.

From point 1, we know Jean is two years older than Mark. Therefore, Jean's current age is 21 + 2 = 23.

"To find the total time for each team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them up.

The well-rounded team's total time is 4 * 55 seconds = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner runs 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's total time is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, and then find the difference between these two probabilities.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is the number of favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (6). So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the product of the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a six-sided die is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5. So, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25 or 25%.

Now, we need to find the difference between the two probabilities. The difference is 50% - 25% = 25%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To find out how many apples Jenna picked, we need to determine half of the number of apples her mom picked. Since her mom picked 20 apples, we can calculate Jenna's share as follows:

Jenna's apples = 1/2 * Mom's apples
Jenna's apples = 1/2 * 20
Jenna's apples = 10

Now, to find the total number of apples they both picked, we add Jenna's apples to her mom's apples:

Total apples = Jenna's apples + Mom's apples
Total apples = 10 + 20
Total apples = 30

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of small rodents (rats and hamsters) and the total number of straw pieces given to them. We know that 160 pieces of straw are distributed among the small rodents.

Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'r'. Since there are 3 cages of rats, the total number of rats is 3r.

The number of hamsters is given as 10.

The total number of small rodents is the sum of the number of rats and hamsters: 3r + 10.

Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. The total number of straw pieces given to the small rodents is 160. We can set up the equation:

6(3r) + 5(10) = 160

Simplifying the equation:

18r + 50 = 160

Subtract 50 from both sides:

18r = 110

Divide both sides by 18:

r = 110 / 18
r = 110 / (2 * 9)
r = 55 / 9
r = 6.11 (approximately)

However, since the number of rats must be a whole number, we need to re-examine the equation. The issue here is that the number of rats must be a whole number, and the division of 110 by 18 does not result in a whole number. 

However, we can re-examine the equation 18r + 50 = 160. We can subtract 50 from both sides to get 18r = 110. Then we can divide both sides by 2 to get 9r = 55. Then we can divide both sides by 9 to get r = 55 / 9. However, we can also divide 110 by 2 to get 55, and then divide 55 by 9 to get 6.11. However, we can also divide 110 by 18 to get 6.11.

"To find the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months and add it to the initial amount.

The formula for simple interest is: A = P(1 + rt), where A is the total amount, P is the principal amount, r is the interest rate, and t is the time in years.

However, in this case, we are given the interest rate as a monthly rate, so we need to convert it to an annual rate first. Since there are 12 months in a year, the annual interest rate is 2% * 12 = 24%.

Now, we can calculate the interest for 3 months. Since the interest rate is given as a decimal, we need to convert the annual interest rate to a decimal: 24% = 0.24.

The interest for 3 months is: 100 * 0.24 * (3/12) = 6

Now, we add the interest to the principal amount: 100 + 6 = 106

So, Mandy should pay Benedict $106.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total revenue and the total cost, and then calculate the profit.

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The total revenue is the selling price per bag multiplied by the number of bags: 30x.

The total cost is the cost of buying the bags plus the cost of transporting them. The cost of buying the bags is 20x, and the cost of transporting them is 2x. So, the total cost is 20x + 2x = 22x.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: 30x - 22x = 8x.

We are given that the profit is $400, so we can set up the equation: 8x = 400.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8: x = 400 / 8 = 50.

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets, the cost of the food, and the cost of the rides, then add them together.

The cost of the tickets is $20.25 for 3 tickets. To find the cost per ticket, we divide the total cost by the number of tickets:
$20.25 / 3 = $6.75 per ticket.

The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets. So, the cost of the food is:
$20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75

The cost of the rides is $33 for each ride, and they went on 2 rides:
$33 * 2 = $66

Now, we add the cost of the tickets, the cost of the food, and the cost of the rides to find the total cost:
$6.75 + $15.75 + $66 = $88.50

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:
$88.50 / 3 = $29.50

The final answer is: $29.50"
"To find the total number of peaches John collects, we need to calculate the total minutes he collects peaches and then multiply it by the number of peaches he collects per minute.

Since John collects peaches for 3 hours, we need to convert the time to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, we know John collects 2 peaches per minute. To find the total number of peaches, we multiply the total minutes by the peaches collected per minute:

180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

The final answer is: 360"
"To find the total amount of insects needed per day, we first need to find the total amount of insects needed per week for the flock of ducks. 

Since there are 10 ducks and each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, we multiply the number of ducks by the amount of insects each duck needs per week:

10 ducks * 3.5 pounds/duck/week = 35 pounds/week

Next, we need to find the amount of insects needed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total amount of insects needed per week by 7:

35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of trees Tom has after 10 years, and then subtract the 30% that die.

First, let's calculate the net change in the number of trees per year. Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2, so the net change is 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year.

Since Tom starts with 50 trees, we can calculate the total number of trees after 10 years by adding the net change to the initial number of trees 10 times:

50 + (8 * 10) = 50 + 80 = 130

However, this is the total number of trees before any die. 30% of the trees die, so we need to calculate 30% of 130 and subtract it from 130.

30% of 130 is 0.3 * 130 = 39.

So, the number of trees that die is 39. 

Now, we subtract 39 from 130 to get the final number of trees:

130 - 39 = 91

The final answer is: 91"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos on Sue's front yard.

On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out on Sue's front yard. So, now there are 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. Now, there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos.

The total number of flamingos on Sue's front yard is 30 (pink) + 6 (white) = 36 flamingos.

To find out how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 (pink) - 6 (white) = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how many crayons Violetta can buy, we need to divide the amount of money she has by the cost of one crayon. 

Number of crayons = Total money / Cost of one crayon
Number of crayons = $20 / $2
Number of crayons = 10

Since Violetta needs 5 different colors, she can buy 2 crayons of each color.

Total number of crayons bought = 2 * 5
Total number of crayons bought = 10

Since she bought 10 crayons and she only needed 5 different colors, she has 5 extra crayons.

Change = Total money - (Cost of crayons bought * Number of crayons bought)
Change = $20 - ($2 * 10)
Change = $20 - $20
Change = $0

However, this is not the case because she bought 10 crayons and she only needed 5 different colors. She has 5 extra crayons, but she still spent all her money on the 10 crayons. 

To find the change, we need to find the cost of the 5 extra crayons and subtract it from the total money.

Cost of extra crayons = Cost of one crayon * Number of extra crayons
Cost of extra crayons = $2 * 5
Cost of extra crayons = $10

Change = Total money - Cost of extra crayons
Change = $20 - $10
Change = $10

Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens.
Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 * 8

"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total pounds of carrots that will be used by the restaurants. 

Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. 

Total pounds of carrots used = Number of restaurants * Pounds per restaurant
Total pounds of carrots used = 40 * 2
Total pounds of carrots used = 80 pounds

Now, we subtract the total pounds of carrots used from the total pounds of carrots available to find out how many pounds will not be used.

Pounds of carrots not used = Total pounds of carrots - Total pounds of carrots used
Pounds of carrots not used = 200 - 80
Pounds of carrots not used = 120

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokemon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times the number of cards she initially had: 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month: 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months: (60 + 40) * 2 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the total number of cards Elaine has: 20 (initial cards) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher as x. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we can say that x = 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, so the total amount Mark earns from Publisher A is 5x = 5 * 500 = 2500 cents.

Since Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, the rate per sentence for Publisher B is 2 * 5 = 10 cents. The total amount Mark earns from Publisher B is 10x = 10 * 500 = 5000 cents.

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we add the earnings from both publishers: 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

"To find the total amount John made that year, we need to calculate his new salary after the 5% raise and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise on his weekly salary:
5% of 2000 = 0.05 * 2000 = 100

New weekly salary = old weekly salary + raise
New weekly salary = 2000 + 100 = 2100

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the new weekly salary by 52:
Total annual salary = new weekly salary * 52
Total annual salary = 2100 * 52
Total annual salary = 109200

Now, let's add the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to the total annual salary:
Total money made that year = total annual salary + one-time reward
Total money made that year = 109200 + 5000
Total money made that year = 114200

"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the number of blue and red pens she bought and add them to the initial number of pens she had.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so the total number of pens she had initially is 22 + 10 = 32.

Each bag of blue pens contains 9 pens, and she bought 6 bags, so the total number of blue pens she bought is 9 * 6 = 54.

Each bag of red pens contains 6 pens, and she bought 2 bags, so the total number of red pens she bought is 6 * 2 = 12.

"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to find the total score she needs for the semester. Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score, we will first find the total score of the five tests and then add the score of the sixth test to it.

The average of six tests is 93, so the total score of the six tests is 6 * 93 = 558.

The total score of the five tests is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 338.

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score among the five tests. The lowest score is 71.

Now, we subtract the lowest score from the total score of the five tests to get the total score without the lowest score: 338 - 71 = 267.

Now, we add the score of the sixth test to the total score without the lowest score to get the total score of the six tests: 267 + x = 558, where x is the score of the sixth test.

To find x, we subtract 267 from both sides of the equation: x = 558 - 267.

x = 291.

"To find the total weight of the bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the weight of the chocolate bars. Since there are 25 chocolate bars and each weighs 40g, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:

25 * 40g = 1000g

Next, let's find the weight of the candied apples. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, the weight of each candied apple is:

40g / 2 = 20g

Now, we can find the total weight of the candied apples:

80 * 20g = 1600g

Finally, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, half a dozen plates will cost 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

We are also given that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since there are 24 cups in a dozen, twenty dozen cups will be 20 * 24 = 480 cups.

To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups: $34,800 / 480 = $72.50.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy and the total amount of money she has earned from babysitting. 

The total cost of the items is the cost of the jacket plus the cost of 2 pairs of shoes: 
$30 (jacket) + 2 * $20 (shoes) = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved, and she earns $5 each time she babysits. To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she already has from the total cost:
$70 (total cost) - $10 (initial savings) = $60.

Since Sara earns $5 each time she babysits, we need to find out how many times she needs to babysit to earn $60:
$60 (amount needed) / $5 (babysitting pay) = 12 times.

However, we also need to consider that Sara earns money from mowing the lawn. We need to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining amount after babysitting. Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we subtract the amount she earns from babysitting from the total amount needed:
$60 (amount needed) - 12 * $5 (babysitting pay) = $60 - $60 = $0.

Since she earns enough from babysitting, she doesn't need to mow the lawn.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. We are given that W = R + 2.

We also know that each red chicken produces 3 eggs per day and each white chicken produces 5 eggs per day. The total number of eggs collected per day is 42. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

3R + 5W = 42

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

R = 4

"To find the time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the dimensions of the park, l = 6 miles and w = 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(l + w)
= 2(6 + 1.5)
= 2(7.5)
= 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, the time he spends walking is the total distance divided by his speed:

Time = Distance / Speed

"To solve this problem, we can start by letting x be the number of customers Sloane counted on the first day. We know that on the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so the number of customers on the second day is x + 50.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500, which is the sum of the customers from the first two days and the customers from the third day. We can write this as an equation:

x + (x + 50) + y = 500

where y is the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day.

We know that the total number of customers on the first day was 100, so we can substitute x = 100 into the equation:

100 + (100 + 50) + y = 500

Combine like terms:

150 + y = 500

Subtract 150 from both sides:

y = 350

So, Sloane counted 350 customers on the third day.

The final answer is: 350"
"Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, the rate of change of water in each pool is -4 gallons/minute. 

The time elapsed is 4 minutes, so the change in water in each pool is -4 * 4 = -16 gallons.

The big pool initially had 2x gallons, and after 4 minutes, it has 2x - 16 gallons. The small pool initially had x gallons, and after 4 minutes, it has x - 16 gallons.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-16 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

24 = x

So the initial amount of water in the small pool was 24 gallons. 

Now, we need to find the amount of water in the small pool after 4 minutes. 

The small pool initially had 24 gallons, and after 4 minutes, it has 24 - 16 = 8 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Janeth will pay in 12 months and then subtract that from the initial amount borrowed plus the additional 10% interest.

First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth will pay in 12 months:

Monthly payment = $165
Number of months = 12
Total amount paid = Monthly payment * Number of months
Total amount paid = $165 * 12
Total amount paid = $1980

Now, let's calculate the total amount Janeth needs to pay, including the 10% interest:

Initial amount borrowed = $2000
Interest = 10% of $2000 = 0.1 * $2000 = $200
Total amount to be paid = Initial amount borrowed + Interest
Total amount to be paid = $2000 + $200
Total amount to be paid = $2200

Now, let's subtract the total amount paid from the total amount to be paid to find the remaining balance:

Remaining balance = Total amount to be paid - Total amount paid
Remaining balance = $2200 - $1980
Remaining balance = $220

The final answer is: $220"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to determine the number of dahlias and add it to the number of roses. 

We know there are 4 roses in the vase. We also know there are 7 more dahlias than roses. 

Let's denote the number of roses as R and the number of dahlias as D. We can express the relationship between the number of dahlias and roses as D = R + 7.

Since we know there are 4 roses, we can substitute R = 4 into the equation D = R + 7. This gives us D = 4 + 7 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of roses and dahlias: Total = R + D = 4 + 11 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the average age of the three in three years, we first need to find their current ages and then add 3 to each age. 

Given that Harriet is 21 years old now, and Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can find Zack's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 2. 

Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age = 2 * 21 = 42

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so we can find Adrian's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 3.

Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age = 3 * 21 = 63

Now, we have the current ages of the three: Harriet (21), Zack (42), and Adrian (63). To find their ages in three years, we add 3 to each age.

Harriet's age in 3 years = 21 + 3 = 24
Zack's age in 3 years = 42 + 3 = 45
Adrian's age in 3 years = 63 + 3 = 66

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3.

Average age = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points Yuri and Brianna scored. 

We know that Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of 68 is 34, and 10 more than that is 44. So, Yuri scored 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, which is 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know that the total points scored by the four students is 251. We have the points scored by Naomi (68), Yuri (44), and Brianna (85). To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the points scored by the other three students from the total points.

Jojo's points = Total points - (Naomi's points + Yuri's points + Brianna's points)
Jojo's points = 251 - (68 + 44 + 85)
Jojo's points = 251 - 197
Jojo's points = 54

1. Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank, so the amount of water left in the tank is 120 - 90 = 30 liters.

2. Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left, so the amount of rainwater collected is 2 * 30 = 60 liters.

3. To find the total amount of water in the tank now, we add the remaining water and the collected rainwater: 30 + 60 = 90 liters.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to add the number of geraniums and petunias. 

First, let's find the number of petunias. Since there are 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, we can subtract 40 from the number of geraniums: 
90 - 40 = 50

Now, we add the number of geraniums and petunias to find the total number of flowers:
90 (geraniums) + 50 (petunias) = 140

The final answer is: 140"
"To find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we need to calculate the amount spent in the second year first. 

The company spends a third of $15000 on advertising for the second year. To find a third of $15000, we divide $15000 by 3.

$15000 / 3 = $5000

Now, we add the amount spent in the first year to the amount spent in the second year to find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years.

$15000 + $5000 = $20000

The total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."
"To find the total cost of the rentals, we need to calculate the cost for Carlos and Benji separately and then add them together.

"To find the total number of days Andrew will travel, we need to calculate the total time it takes for the round trip.

First, let's find the time it takes for each leg of the trip:

- Time to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus: 6 days
- Time to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by car: 6 / 2 = 3 days

Since Andrew will travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus and return from Rochester by car, we need to double the time for the one-way trip by bus and add the time for the one-way trip by car.

Total time = (2 * 6) + 3
Total time = 12 + 3
Total time = 15

"To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we need to first calculate the total number of cards James has after losing 8 water type and buying 14 grass type.

Initially, James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. 

After losing 8 water type cards, he has:
- 30 (fire type) + 20 (grass type) + (40 - 8) (water type) = 30 + 20 + 32 = 82 cards

After buying 14 grass type cards, he has:
- 30 (fire type) + (20 + 14) (grass type) + 32 (water type) = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 cards

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type. To do this, we divide the number of water type cards by the total number of cards and multiply by 100.

Percentage chance = (32 / 96) * 100 ≈ 33.33%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33."
"To find out how much Chad still owes, we need to calculate the total cost of his meal and then subtract the gift card amount.

The base burrito costs $6.50. 
He adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each, which is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50. 
So, the total cost of the add-ons is $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50.
The total cost of the meal before the upgrade is $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00.
He upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, so the new total is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.
He has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract this from the total: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the combined rate at which Kalinda and her mom can add pieces to the puzzle. 

Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can add half as many pieces per minute, which is 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

The combined rate is 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Since there are 360 pieces in the puzzle, we need to find out how many minutes it will take to complete the puzzle. 

360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour.

The final answer is: 1"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, there were 120 baby watermelons.

After two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest. To find 30% of 120, we multiply 120 by 0.3.

120 * 0.3 = 36

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest after two months. This means 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons were not ready.

After two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. To find 3/4 of 84, we multiply 84 by 3/4.

84 * (3/4) = 84 * 0.75 = 63

So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks. This means 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons were not ready.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees.

The total cost of the cars is the price of one car multiplied by the number of cars: 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.

The tax on the cars is 10% of the total cost of the cars: 0.1 * $240,000 = $24,000.

The registration fees are $1000 per car, so the total registration fees are 12 * $1000 = $12,000.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

The final answer is: $276,000."
"To find out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we first need to determine how many shells she collected on Monday. 

On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, we can calculate Kylie's Monday collection as follows:
Kylie's Monday collection = Robert's Monday collection + 5
Kylie's Monday collection = 20 + 5
Kylie's Monday collection = 25

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. To find out how many shells she collects on Tuesday, we can multiply her Monday collection by 2:
Kylie's Tuesday collection = 2 * Kylie's Monday collection
Kylie's Tuesday collection = 2 * 25
Kylie's Tuesday collection = 50

"To find out how many vines Steve needs, we first need to determine how many tomatoes he eats per week. Since he eats 6 tomatoes per day, we multiply this by 7 to get the total number of tomatoes he eats per week.

6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we can assume his girlfriend eats half as much as Steve. So, his girlfriend eats 6 / 2 = 3 tomatoes per day. 

3 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 21 tomatoes/week

The total number of tomatoes they both eat per week is 42 (Steve) + 21 (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes/week.

Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, so to find out how many vines they need, we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by the number of tomatoes per vine.

63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines

"To find out how many pizzas John needs to order, we need to determine the total number of slices required and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

First, let's calculate the total number of slices needed: 
Total friends = 20
Slices per friend = 4
Total slices needed = Total friends * Slices per friend
Total slices needed = 20 * 4
Total slices needed = 80

Since pizzas are sold in 8 slices, we need to divide the total number of slices needed by the number of slices per pizza:
Total slices needed = 80
Slices per pizza = 8
Number of pizzas = Total slices needed / Slices per pizza
Number of pizzas = 80 / 8
Number of pizzas = 10

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas to ensure each of his 20 friends gets 4 slices.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many new pens Ram can make from the 25 pens he buys. Since he can make one full pen from the ink of five empty pens, we can divide the total number of pens by 5 to find out how many new pens he can make.

25 pens / 5 pens per new pen = 5 new pens

However, we also need to consider the initial 25 pens he bought. So, we add the 5 new pens to the initial 25 pens.

25 (initial pens) + 5 (new pens) = 30 pens

Therefore, Ram gets to have a total of 30 pens.

"To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we need to determine the ages of Mary and Joan first.

Since Jessa is 20 years old, and Joan is five years older than Jessa, we can calculate Joan's age as follows:
Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5
Joan's age = 20 + 5
Joan's age = 25

Now, we know that Mary is two years younger than Joan, so we can calculate Mary's age as follows:
Mary's age = Joan's age - 2
Mary's age = 25 - 2
Mary's age = 23

Now that we have the ages of all three girls, we can find the sum of their ages:
Sum of ages = Jessa's age + Joan's age + Mary's age
Sum of ages = 20 + 25 + 23
Sum of ages = 68

"To find the total number of hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he writes and then multiply it by the time it takes him to write one page.

First, let's find the total number of letters Mike writes. He has 3 pen pals left, and each of them sends 2 letters a week. So, the total number of letters he receives is 3 * 2 = 6 letters.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week. 

Now, let's find the total number of pages he writes. Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 30 pages * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. So, the total time he spends writing a week is 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.

"To find out how many cookies Sue ate on Monday and Tuesday, we need to first determine how many cookies her sister ate on each day. 

Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday. 
On Tuesday, she ate 13 cookies. 

Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday. 
On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so she ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

The total number of cookies Sue ate is 20 + 26 = 46. 
The total number of cookies her sister ate is 5 + 13 = 18.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, the total calories Sue consumed is 46 * 200 = 9200. 
The total calories her sister consumed is 18 * 200 = 3600.

The difference in calories consumed is 9200 - 3600 = 5600.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. 

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's denote the number of cougars killed today as 'x'. Then, the number of wolves killed today is 3x.

We are also given that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, the number of cougars killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since we know the number of cougars killed today is 12, we can equate it to 'x' and solve for 'x':

x = 12

Now that we know 'x', we can find the number of wolves killed today:

Number of wolves killed today = 3x = 3 * 12 = 36

To find the total number of animals killed, we add the number of animals killed last night and today:

Total animals killed = (10 + 15) + (36 + 12)

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we need to calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30. 

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 

So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. 

To find out how many times Robert went down the slide, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4.

"To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we first need to determine the total number of cows Mr. Sylas bought and added to the stalls. 

Initially, there were 10 stalls with 20 cows each, so the total number of cows was 10 * 20 = 200.

Mr. Sylas bought 40 more cows, so the total number of cows now is 200 + 40 = 240.

Since Mr. Sylas divides the 40 new cows equally among the 10 stalls, each stall gets 40 / 10 = 4 new cows.

Now, each stall has 20 (initial cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows.

To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8: 24 * 8 = 192.

- 40 dollar bills = 40 x $1.00 = $40.00

Now, let's add the values together:
$1.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $40.00 = $45.00

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To find the total weight of the redwood tree, we first need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections. 

The redwood is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get the number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so we multiply the number of sections by the weight per section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

Now, we need to find 30% of the total weight that the termites ate. To do this, we multiply the total weight by 0.3 (which is the decimal form of 30%): 8000 * 0.3 = 2400 pounds.

To find the remaining weight after the termites ate 30% of the wood, we subtract the weight eaten by the termites from the total weight: 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds.

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the total amount Nancy has to pay, we need to calculate the total cost of the overdue books and add the flat fee.

The cost of the overdue books is $0.50 per book, and she has 8 books. So, the total cost of the overdue books is 8 * $0.50 = $4.00.

Adding the flat fee of $2.00, the total amount Nancy has to pay is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

The final answer is: $6.00"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples. So, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.
2. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.
3. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits. 
Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, so she has 52 + 24 = 76 fruits.
Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas, so he has 44 + 48 = 92 fruits.

The total number of fruits is 76 (Andrea's fruits) + 92 (Jamal's fruits) = 168.

The final answer is: 168"
"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we first need to determine how many cups are needed for each day. 

Since two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies, and there are 12 cookies in a dozen, we can find the amount of flour needed per cookie. 

2 cups / 12 cookies = 1/6 cup per cookie

Now, we can calculate the total amount of flour needed for each day. 

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies, so she will need:
36 cookies * 1/6 cup per cookie = 6 cups

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies, so she will need:
30 cookies * 1/6 cup per cookie = 5 cups

To find the total amount of flour needed for both days, we add the amounts needed for each day:
6 cups + 5 cups = 11 cups

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two-thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to first calculate two-thirds of 9,300.

Two-thirds of 9,300 can be calculated as (2/3) * 9,300.

To multiply a fraction by a number, we multiply the numerator (2) by the number (9,300) and keep the denominator (3) the same.

(2/3) * 9,300 = (2 * 9,300) / 3
= 18,600 / 3
= 6,200

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = $62

The final answer is: $62"
"To find the total number of marbles Maddison has now, we need to calculate the initial number of marbles and then add the marbles she received from her friend.

Maddison initially has 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each box. So, the initial number of marbles is 5 * 50 = 250.

Then, she gets 20 marbles from her friend. To find the total number of marbles now, we add the initial number of marbles to the marbles she received: 250 + 20 = 270.

The final answer is: $300"
"To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, then add them to the selling price.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500.

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

The total price of the house is the sum of the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

To find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price: $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid in fees and subtract it from the selling price, then subtract the remaining loan amount.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000.

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000.

The total amount paid in fees is $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

Now, let's subtract the total fees from the selling price: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000.

Finally, let's subtract the remaining loan amount: $368,000 - $250,000 = $118,000.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know it takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees. Then, it takes 40% longer to heat up to 400 degrees. 

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.

After warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. It took 28 minutes to warm up the oil, so it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is the sum of the time it took to warm up the oil and the time it took to cook. 

Total time = 28 minutes (to warm up the oil) + 23 minutes (to cook) = 51 minutes.

"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we first need to determine the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette. 

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches used for the body, which is 900. So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Since the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800, and the body takes 900 stitches, the total number of stitches for the sleeves is 1800 - 900 - 270 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each scene and the song, and then add them together.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has (4/5) * 60 = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: R = 6S
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: (R + 9) = 3(S + 9)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for S:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 3S from both sides:

3S + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:

3S = 18

Divide both sides by 3:

S = 6

Sam is 6 years old now.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. A cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba. Let's denote the number of spots on a mamba as 'x'. Then, the number of spots on a cobra is 2x.

2. We know that a cobra has 70 spots. So, we can set up the equation 2x = 70 to find the number of spots on a mamba.

3. Solving for x, we get x = 70 / 2 = 35. This means a mamba has 35 spots.

4. Now, we know that there are 40 cobras and 60 mambas in the snake park. The total number of spots on the cobras is 40 * 70 = 2800.

5. The total number of spots on the mambas is 60 * 35 = 2100.

6. The total number of spots on all the snakes is 2800 + 2100 = 4900.

"To find the number of rows of 5-star, we first need to find the total number of stars in the flag. 

The flag has three rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 3 * 8 = 24. 

It also has two rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 * 6 = 12. 

The total number of stars in the flag is 76. We can find the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows by adding 24 and 12, which is 36. 

Now, we subtract the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total number of stars in the flag to find the number of stars in the 5-star rows. 76 - 36 = 40. 

Since each 5-star row has 5 stars, we can find the number of rows of 5-star by dividing the total number of stars in the 5-star rows by 5. 40 / 5 = 8.

"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

First, let's find the total time she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

Total time worked = 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the total time to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:

150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval:

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

Therefore, Susan earns $75 for the online task.

"To find the total points of all three players after the extra points are distributed, we need to first calculate their points after the fourth round.

Initially, Mike has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point. Now Mike has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
Jim has 18 points, so he does not get an extra point. Jim still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point. Now Tony has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's calculate the total points of all three players after the extra points are distributed:
Mike has 22 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points.
Total points = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83

"To find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then divide the total amount of rice available by this daily consumption.

First, let's calculate the daily consumption of rice for 5 members. Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 3 meals per day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). 

Daily consumption per person = 0.2 kg/meal * 3 meals = 0.6 kg/day

Since there are 5 members, the total daily consumption is:
Total daily consumption = 0.6 kg/day * 5 members = 3 kg/day

Now, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. To do this, we divide the total amount of rice available by the daily consumption:
Number of days = Total rice available / Daily consumption
= 42 kg / 3 kg/day
= 14 days

Since we want to find out how many weeks the rice will last, we need to convert the number of days to weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so:
Number of weeks = Number of days / 7
= 14 days / 7
= 2 weeks

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first need to calculate the total number of crates he sold in the week. 

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he sold bread for 5 days. 

He sold 20 crates over the weekend, which is 2 days. 
He sold 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday.

Total crates sold = 20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) = 65 crates

Since he was closed on Monday and Friday, he had 5 working days. His target for the week is 120 crates. 

To find the target for 5 working days, we need to calculate the daily target: 
Daily target = 120 / 7 = 17.14 (approximately)

Since he can't sell a fraction of a crate, we'll consider the daily target as 17 crates per day.

Target for 5 working days = 17 * 5 = 85 crates

Now, let's find out how many crates he was off from his target:
Crates off target = Target for 5 working days - Total crates sold
= 85 - 65
= 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost of the desk, we need to determine the last bid made by Carmen. 

Since there are 3 other people who bid once, and Carmen bids after each of them, the total number of bids made by the other 3 people and Carmen is 3 + 3 = 6. 

The first bid is $200, and each subsequent bid increases by $50. To find the last bid, we can use the formula for an arithmetic sequence: 

Last bid = First bid + (Number of bids - 1) * Increment
Last bid = 200 + (6 - 1) * 50
Last bid = 200 + 5 * 50
Last bid = 200 + 250
Last bid = 450

However, this is the last bid made by one of the other people. Since Carmen bids after each of them, she makes 4 bids (one after each of the other 3 people and one after the last person). 

The last bid made by Carmen is the last bid made by one of the other people plus the increment, which is $50. 

Last bid made by Carmen = 450 + 50
Last bid made by Carmen = 500

The total cost of the desk is the last bid made by Carmen.

The final answer is: $500"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total miles driven, the total cost of driving, and the total bonus paid.

1. Total miles driven: Since John goes to work and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 2 * 30 = 60 miles. He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total miles driven is 60 * 5 * 50 = 15,000 miles.

2. Total cost of driving: John is charged $2 per mile driven, so the total cost of driving is 15,000 * $2 = $30,000.

3. Total bonus paid: John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus paid is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

4. Total cost: The total cost is the sum of the total cost of driving and the total bonus paid, which is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The final answer is: $31,800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to add the minutes he exercised on each day. 

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined time by 2.

Combined time: 39 minutes
Twice the combined time: 2 * 39 = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

The final answer is: 78"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of pages and how they are arranged in the tabloid. 

When a piece of paper is folded, it creates two pages. The first page is the front, and the second page is the back. 

Since we have a 32-page tabloid, we need to find the number of pieces of paper required to create this. 

We can start by considering the number of pages on each side of the folded paper. The left side will have pages 1-16, and the right side will have pages 17-32. 

However, since the paper is folded, each piece of paper will have two pages on the left side and two pages on the right side. 

So, we need to find the number of pieces of paper required to create 32 pages. 

Since each piece of paper creates 4 pages (2 on the left and 2 on the right), we can divide the total number of pages by 4 to find the number of pieces of paper required.

32 pages / 4 pages per piece of paper = 8 pieces of paper

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on food and snacks, and then subtract that from the initial amount she brought.

Annika spent half of $50 on food and snacks, which is 50 / 2 = $25.

She also spent an additional $10 on rides.

So, the total amount she spent is $25 (food and snacks) + $10 (rides) = $35.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount she brought: $50 - $35 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Total books = 250
- Unsold books = 50
- Books sold this year = 45
- Books sold in the first year = 2 * Books sold this year = 2 * 45 = 90
- Books sold in the second year = Total books - Unsold books - Books sold this year - Books sold in the first year
= 250 - 50 - 45 - 90
= 65

Since each book sells at $20, the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
Total money earned in the second year = Books sold in the second year * Price per book
= 65 * 20
= 1300

The final answer is: $1300"
"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week: 
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Since Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

In a month, there are approximately 4 weeks. So, his total earnings from his hourly wage in April are:
$500/week * 4 weeks = $2000

Additionally, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. Since the company performed well for the whole month, he gets the bonus for 4 weeks:
$300/week * 4 weeks = $1200

Now, let's add his earnings from his hourly wage and the bonus to find his total earnings in April:
$2000 + $1200 = $3200

The final answer is: $3200"
"To find out how many people John lost to, we need to find 20% of 20, since that's the percentage of people he lost to.

"To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we first need to determine how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 

Two-thirds of 60 is calculated as (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves sold in the morning.

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. The total number of loaves left is 60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. Half of 20 is calculated as (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are divided equally between the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which Joey loses weight and then use that rate to find out how long it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find the rate at which Joey loses weight, we divide the weight lost by the number of weeks:

Weight lost per week = 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we can multiply the number of weeks it takes Joey to lose the weight by 4:

Time it takes Sandy to lose the same amount of weight = 4 weeks * 4 = 16 weeks

"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

The original price of a tub of ice cream is $13, and it's now sold at $11. The discount on each tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $2.

If you buy 2 tubs of ice cream, the total discount on the ice cream will be 2 * $2 = $4.

The original price of a packet of milk is not given, but we know that it was sold at a discount of $0.5. Let's assume the original price of a packet of milk is x. The selling price of a packet of milk is x - $0.5.

Since the discount is given, we can set up an equation to find the original price of a packet of milk. Let's assume the original price of a packet of milk is x. The selling price of a packet of milk is x - $0.5. We are not given the original price of the packet of milk, but we can use the information that the discount is $0.5. 

However, we can calculate the savings on the packets of milk by multiplying the number of packets by the discount. The discount on each packet of milk is $0.5, and you buy 4 packets of milk. The total discount on the milk will be 4 * $0.5 = $2.

Now, we can find the total savings by adding the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk. The total savings will be $4 + $2 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs grown after 15 days.

The person will grow an extra arm every 3 days. To find out how many arms they will grow in 15 days, we divide 15 by 3. 

15 / 3 = 5

So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

The person will grow an extra leg every 5 days. To find out how many legs they will grow in 15 days, we divide 15 by 5.

15 / 5 = 3

So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

In total, the person will grow 5 extra arms and 3 extra legs. To find the total number of new limbs, we add the number of arms and legs.

5 (arms) + 3 (legs) = 8

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. Calculate the total cost of the business suits:
   Number of suits = 6
   Cost per suit = $100
   Total cost of suits = 6 * $100 = $600

2. Calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
   Number of suitcases = 3
   Cost per suitcase = $50
   Total cost of suitcases = 3 * $50 = $150

3. Calculate the cost of the flight ticket:
   Let's denote the cost of a business suit as 'x'. 
   The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit, so the cost of the flight ticket is 5x + $700.

4. Calculate the total amount spent so far:
   Total spent so far = Total cost of suits + Total cost of suitcases + Cost of flight ticket
   Total spent so far = $600 + $150 + (5x + $700)

5. Calculate the total amount spent on the trip, including the flight ticket:
   Total spent on the trip = Total spent so far + $2000 (amount saved)
   Total spent on the trip = $600 + $150 + (5x + $700) + $2000
   Total spent on the trip = $2750 + 5x

6. Calculate the total amount available for the trip:
   Total available for the trip = $6000 (initial amount) - $2000 (amount saved)
   Total available for the trip = $4000

7. Since the total amount spent on the trip should not exceed the total available for the trip, we can set up an equation:
   $2750 + 5x ≤ $4000

8. Solve the inequality for x:
   5x ≤ $4000 - $2750
   5x ≤ $1250
   x ≤ $250

9. Since the cost of a business suit is $100, we can verify that x = $100 satisfies the inequality:
   5 * $100 ≤ $1250
   $500 ≤ $1250

10. Now, we can calculate the cost of the flight ticket:
    Cost of flight ticket = 5x + $700
    Cost of flight ticket = 5 * $100 + $700
    Cost of flight ticket = $500 + $700
    Cost of flight ticket = $1200

11. Calculate the total amount spent on the trip:
    Total spent on the trip = Total cost of suits + Total cost of suitcases + Cost of flight ticket
    Total spent on the trip = $600 + $150 + $1200
    Total spent on the trip = $1950

12. Calculate the amount left for buying gifts:
    Amount left for gifts = Total available for the trip - Total spent on the trip
    Amount left for gifts = $4000 - $1950
    Amount left for gifts = $2050

"To find the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we first need to determine how many eggs each person eats in a week and then multiply that by the total number of people.

Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so they eat 3 * 3 = 9 eggs per day. Since there are 3 people eating 3 eggs each day, the total number of eggs they eat in a day is 3 * 9 = 27 eggs.

The rest of the family members, which is 5 - 3 = 2 people, eat 2 eggs each day. So, the total number of eggs they eat in a day is 2 * 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, we add the total number of eggs eaten by both groups to find the total number of eggs eaten by the family in a day: 27 + 4 = 31 eggs.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the total number of eggs eaten in a day by 7 to find the total number of eggs eaten in a week: 31 * 7 = 217 eggs.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Noah's current age as N and the population of Chile now as P.

Since Cera is 46 years old now, six years ago, Cera's age was 46 - 6 = 40.

We are given that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so we can write the equation: N - 6 = 0.5(40).

Solving for N, we get N - 6 = 20, which implies N = 26.

Now, we are given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, so we can write the equation: 3000N = 0.5P.

Substituting N = 26, we get 3000(26) = 0.5P.

Simplifying, we get 78000 = 0.5P.

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get P = 156000.

The final answer is: 156000"
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D, the number of players on the offense as O, and the number of players on the special teams as S.

We are given that there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, so O = 2D.

We are also given that there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so S = D/2.

The total number of players on the team is 105, which is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. Therefore, we can write the equation:

O + D + S = 105

Substituting the expressions for O and S in terms of D, we get:

2D + D + D/2 = 105

Combine like terms:

4.5D = 105

Divide both sides by 4.5:

D = 105 / 4.5
D = 23.33

Since the number of players must be a whole number, we round down to the nearest whole number, as you can't have a fraction of a player.

D = 23

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total number of people invited, we first need to calculate the number of people from the 2 families with 6 people and the 3 families with 4 people.

For the 2 families with 6 people, the total number of people is 2 * 6 = 12.
For the 3 families with 4 people, the total number of people is 3 * 4 = 12.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. So, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

Now, 1/4 of the people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments. 1/4 of 8 is 2. So, we subtract 2 from the number of people who couldn't come due to illness: 8 - 2 = 6.

The number of people who couldn't come due to illness or previous commitments is 6. We subtract this from the total number of people invited: 24 - 6 = 18.

"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, his father gave him 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 (initial marbles) + 20 (bought from Johanna) + 8 (given by his father) = 98 marbles.

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of marbles is 98 * 2 = 196 kgs.

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as the pool) is V = length * width * height.

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length (L) = 6 feet
- Width (W) = 4 feet
- Height (H) = 5 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:
V = L * W * H
V = 6 * 4 * 5
V = 120 cubic feet

Now, we know the volume of the pool is 120 cubic feet. The cost to fill the pool is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. To find the total cost, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot:
Total Cost = Volume * Cost per cubic foot
Total Cost = 120 * 0.1
Total Cost = 12

"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of girls, nongendered children, and then add them to the number of boys.

Given that there are 30 boys, and the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, the number of girls can be calculated as:
Girls = 3 * Boys = 3 * 30 = 90

The classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, so the number of nongendered children can be calculated as:
Nongendered children = (1/10) * Boys = (1/10) * 30 = 3

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
Total children = Boys + Girls + Nongendered children = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123

Let's denote the number of electric poles as 'x'. According to the given ratio, the number of electric wires will be 3x.

We are given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

3x = 45

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required by the electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood is 15.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women at the party. The total number of people at the party is 25 + 15 = 40.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. To find the number of people who left, we multiply the total number of people by 1/4:

1/4 * 40 = 10

So, 10 people left the party.

Since 22 men stayed at the party, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3.

We know that 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men. Therefore, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7.

Initially, there were 15 women at the party. Since 7 women left, the number of women left is 15 - 7 = 8.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. We can set up an equation to represent this:

3x + 2 = 26

where x is the number of pencils in each box. To find x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 26 - 2
3x = 24

Now, we can divide both sides by 3 to solve for x:

x = 24 / 3
x = 8

So, each box contains 8 pencils.

Now, let's find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each, which is 3 * 8 = 24 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils they have together is 24 + 46 = 70.

To find the number of boxes needed to store all their pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils in each box:

Number of boxes = Total number of pencils / Number of pencils per box
= 70 / 8
= 8.75

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the effect of cooling the coffee and the effect of adding cream.

First, let's consider the effect of cooling the coffee. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and weakens it by 12 milliliters. Since the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, we need to find out how many ice cubes are required to achieve this. 

Let's assume the number of ice cubes is 'x'. Then, the total cooling effect is 13x degrees. Since the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, we can set up the equation:

13x = 65

Solving for x, we get:

x = 65 / 13
x = 5

So, 5 ice cubes are required to cool the coffee by 65 degrees.

Now, let's consider the effect of adding cream. Each ice cube also weakens the coffee by 12 milliliters. Since 5 ice cubes are added, the total weakening effect is 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters.

However, we are also adding 15 milliliters of cream, which weakens the coffee. The net weakening effect of the ice cubes and cream is:

60 - 15 = 45 milliliters

Therefore, Shannon's iced coffee is 45 milliliters weaker.

The final answer is: 45"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios. Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, the ratio of old records to new records is 2:1.

Let's denote the number of old records brought in by the 5 people as x. Since 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can set up the following equation based on the ratio:

2x / 1 = 7 * 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x = 35

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 35 / 2
x = 17.5

Since the number of records must be a whole number, we can round up to the nearest whole number, as you can't have a fraction of a record. However, in this case, we can also consider that the 5 people may have traded some of their records to get the 7 new records, so the total number of old records brought in should be a multiple of 2 to satisfy the 2:1 ratio.

Considering this, we can multiply 17.5 by 2 to get the nearest whole number that satisfies the ratio:

x = 35

So, the 5 people brought in 35 old records."
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of junior programmers. The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 100. 

Number of junior programmers = (2/5) * 100 = 40

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, the monthly salary of a senior programmer is $2000 + $400 = $2400.

The number of senior programmers is the total number of employees minus the number of junior programmers, which is 100 - 40 = 60.

Now, let's calculate the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers separately.

Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Monthly salary of a junior programmer
= 40 * $2000
= $80000

Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Monthly salary of a senior programmer
= 60 * $2400
= $144000

Now, let's add the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers to find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month.

Total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month = $80000 + $144000
= $208000

"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as 'x'. 

Initially, there were x people on the bus. 

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total number of people became x + 5.

At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the number of people became (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2.

Then, 8 more people got in, so the total number of people became (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6.

We are given that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20, so we can set up the equation:

x + 6 = 20

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:

x = 20 - 6
x = 14

The final answer is: 14"

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to first find the total time it takes to charge from 60% to 100%. 

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, it will take 3 minutes to charge 1 percentage-point. 

The remaining charge needed to fully charge the phone is 100% - 60% = 40%. 

Since it takes 3 minutes to charge 1 percentage-point, it will take 40 * 3 = 120 minutes to charge 40 percentage-points.

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours.

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to start with the initial number of lollipops she had, which is 7. Then, we add the number of lollipops her mother gave her, which is 10. 

7 (initial lollipops) + 10 (lollipops from her mother) = 17 lollipops

After that, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella. To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we subtract the number of lollipops she gave away from the total number of lollipops she had.

17 (total lollipops) - 3 (lollipops given away) = 14 lollipops

So, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

The final answer is: 14"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's determine the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 they spend, they get $1 off their next purchase. 

$80 / $20 = 4, so they earned 4 rewards.

Now, let's calculate the rewards they used on this shopping trip. They spent $43 and used their rewards, and then applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. 

Let's denote the rewards used as 'r'. Since the coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price, the amount taken off by the coupon is 2r.

The total amount taken off is the sum of the rewards and the coupon: r + 2r = 3r.

The price after applying the rewards and the coupon is $43 - 3r.

However, we know that the rewards earned from the last shopping trip were 4. Since the rewards are applied to the next purchase, the rewards used on this shopping trip must be 4.

Now we can substitute r = 4 into the equation: $43 - 3(4) = $43 - 12 = $31.

The customer paid $31 on this shopping trip.

The final answer is: $31"
"To determine which job pays more, we need to calculate the net pay for each job.

For Job A, the total income is $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000. The total tax is 20% of $30,000, which is 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000. The net pay for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

For Job B, the total income is $42,000. The property tax is $6,000, so the net income before taxes is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. The tax on this is 10% of $36,000, which is 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600. The net pay for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

Since $32,400 is greater than $24,000, Job B pays more. To find the difference in net pay, we subtract the net pay of Job A from the net pay of Job B: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400"
"To find the number of ruined castles, we need to calculate 40% of the total number of castles. 

40% of 220 = 0.4 * 220 = 88

Since half of the ruined castles are unmanned, we need to divide the number of ruined castles by 2.

88 / 2 = 44

So, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

The final answer is: 44"
"To find the total cost of each offer, we need to calculate the total amount paid in installments and add the advance payment.

For Furniture United's offer:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

For Cozy Homes' offer:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

Now, we can find the cost difference between the two offers:
Cost difference = Total cost of Furniture United's offer - Total cost of Cozy Homes' offer
= $3,450 - $3,350
= $100

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the price of the shares after the first year and then after the second year.

Initially, Maria buys 8 shares for $8 each, so the total cost is 8 * 8 = $64.

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price, we multiply the original price by 1.5 (100% + 50% = 150%, or 1 + 0.5 = 1.5). 

New price after the first year = 8 * 1.5 = $12.

The stock price decreases by 25% in the second year. To find the new price, we multiply the price after the first year by 0.75 (100% - 25% = 75%, or 1 - 0.25 = 0.75).

New price after the second year = 12 * 0.75 = $9.

Now, we multiply the new price after the second year by the number of shares to find the final value of Maria's shares.

Final value = 9 * 8 = $72.

The final answer is: $72"
"To find out how many hot dogs John ate, we first need to determine how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, Thomas ate 2 * 3 = 6 hot dogs.

John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate: 3 - 2 = 1.

The final answer is: 1"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as x. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

Since the smallest group has x - 10 students, we can find the number of students in the smallest group by subtracting 10 from x:

x - 10 = 70 - 10
= 60

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's denote the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as Ch. We are given that Ch = 2C, and the total number of animals is 60, so we can write the equation:

C + Ch = 60

Substituting Ch = 2C into the equation, we get:

C + 2C = 60
3C = 60

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

C = 20

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

Ch = 2C = 2(20) = 40

The total number of legs of the cows is 4C = 4(20) = 80, and the total number of legs of the chickens is 2Ch = 2(40) = 80.

The total number of legs of all the animals is 80 + 80 = 160.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find out how many balls Josh is juggling at the talent show, we need to determine how many balls he was juggling before the incident and then subtract the balls that were lost.

Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. So, the total number of balls he was juggling before the incident is 3 + (1 * 4) = 7.

However, Josh drops 3 balls, but 2 are caught by the crowd. So, the total number of balls lost is 3 - 2 = 1.

Therefore, Josh starts juggling with 7 - 1 = 6 balls on stage."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up equations based on the given information. Let's denote the weight of the blue beetle as B, the green toad as T, the yellow snake as S, and the red bird as R.

We know that the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, so B = 50 pounds. We also know that the pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so T = 50 pounds. 

The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so S = 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so R = 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal by adding the weights of all the animals and the container: 20 (container) + 50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 60 (yellow snake) + 30 (red bird) = 210 pounds.

"To find the total distance Tyson covered in June, we first need to calculate the new daily distance he needs to run based on his coach's advice. 

The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day. This means we need to find 1/5 of 5000 meters and add it to the original distance.

1/5 of 5000 meters is (1/5) * 5000 = 1000 meters.

So, the new daily distance is 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters.

Since there are 30 days in June, we can find the total distance covered in June by multiplying the new daily distance by 30.

Total distance = 6000 meters/day * 30 days = 180,000 meters.

The final answer is: 180000"
"To find the price difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B, we first need to determine the prices of Juice Box B and Juice Box C.

Juice Box A is 4 dollars.
Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box B is 4 + 5 = 9 dollars.
Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box C is 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

The restaurant has 50 tables with 3 legs, so the total number of legs for these tables is 50 * 3 = 150.

Now, we add the total number of legs for both types of tables: 160 + 150 = 310.

The total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310."
"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to first determine how many cookies are used by her son and her husband.

Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so the total number of cookies her son eats is 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so the total number of cookies her husband eats is 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

The total number of cookies used by her son and her husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since each bag has 36 cookies, and 27 cookies are used by her son and her husband, the number of cookies left for Jenny is 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies.

"To find the total cost of the shirts, we first need to calculate the discount amount. 

The original price of each shirt is $30. 
The discount percentage is 40%, which means 40% of $30 is the discount amount.

Discount amount = 40% of $30 = 0.4 * $30 = $12

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the discounted price of one shirt.
Discounted price of one shirt = Original price - Discount amount
= $30 - $12
= $18

Since Davos bought 2 shirts, we multiply the discounted price of one shirt by 2 to get the total cost.
Total cost = Discounted price of one shirt * 2
= $18 * 2
= $36

"To find the percentage increase in the amount of money the factory is making per day, we need to first find the difference in the amount of money they are making per day now and the amount they used to make per day.

The factory used to make $100 per tractor and sold 10 tractors a day, so they made $100 * 10 = $1000 per day.

Now, they make $220 per silo and sell 5 silos a day, so they make $220 * 5 = $1100 per day.

The difference in the amount of money they are making per day now and the amount they used to make per day is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original amount and multiply by 100:

($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total amount Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the monthly expenses and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's find the monthly expenses.

$25/week * 4 weeks/month = $100/month

Treats cost $20 per month.

Medicine costs $100 per month.

Now, let's add up the monthly expenses:
$100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total annual expenses are:
$220/month * 12 months/year = $2640/year

"To find out how many plant pots April has left over, we need to determine the total number of plant pots she needs and subtract that from the number she already bought.

First, let's calculate the number of plant pots needed for the roses. Since the school needs twice as many plant pots for the roses as for the daisies, and they need 30 plant pots for the daisies, they need 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots for the roses.

The total number of plant pots needed is 30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = 90 plant pots.

Since April had already bought 100 plant pots, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number she bought: 100 - 90 = 10.

Therefore, April has 10 plant pots left over.

"To find the total time John spent, we need to calculate the time spent boating, swimming, and watching shows. 

Time spent boating = 6 hours
Time spent swimming = 6 / 2 = 3 hours
Time spent watching shows = 3 * 2 = 6 hours

Total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows = 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours

Since this is 30% of the total time, we can set up the equation: 0.3x = 15, where x is the total time.

To find x, we divide both sides by 0.3: x = 15 / 0.3 = 50 hours

Now that we have the total time, we can find the time spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time: 0.4 * 50 = 20 hours

Earnings from first job = $10 * 20
Earnings from first job = $200

Next, let's calculate her earnings from the second job:
Earnings from second job = Hourly wage * Number of hours worked
Earnings from second job = $5 * 15
Earnings from second job = $75

Now, let's find her total earnings:

"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost of the activities. 

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is $5 per person. Since we don't know the number of friends yet, let's call it 'x'. The total cost for mini-golf will be 1 (Morgan) + x (friends) * $5.

The cost of arcade tokens is $5.

The cost of go-karts is $10 per ride, and Morgan and her friends will ride it twice. So, the total cost for go-karts will be 2 * ($10 + $10) = $40.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all activities: $5 (mini-golf) + $5 (arcade tokens) + $40 (go-karts) = $50.

We know that Morgan has a budget of $90. So, the total cost of activities should not exceed $90. We can set up an equation to represent this:

1 (Morgan) + x (friends) * $5 + $5 (arcade tokens) + $40 (go-karts) ≤ $90

Simplifying the equation, we get:
1 + 5x + 5 + 40 ≤ 90
Combine like terms:
46 + 5x ≤ 90
Subtract 46 from both sides:
5x ≤ 44
Divide both sides by 5:
x ≤ 8.8

Since we can't invite a fraction of a friend, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Morgan can invite up to 8 friends.

Marisa buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, so the total amount she spends on lollipops each day is:
4 lollipops * 25 cents/lollipop = 100 cents or $1

Since Marisa gets $5 as pocket money each day, the amount she saves each day is:
$5 - $1 = $4

Now, we need to find out how much she saves in 5 days:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much change Billy has after buying the candy. 

Let's denote the number of pounds of candy Billy bought as 'x'. The cost of the candy is $1.5x. Since Billy has $10, the change he has after buying the candy is $10 - $1.5x.

Next, Billy spends half of this change on gumballs. Since each gumball costs $0.05, the total cost of gumballs is 0.05 * (change / 2) = 0.05 * (10 - 1.5x) / 2.

We are given that Billy bought 40 gumballs, so we can set up the equation:

0.05 * (10 - 1.5x) / 2 = 0.05 * 40

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(10 - 1.5x) / 2 = 40

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

10 - 1.5x = 80

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get:

-1.5x = 70

Dividing both sides by -1.5, we get:

x = -70 / 1.5
x = -46.67

However, since we can't buy a negative amount of candy, this solution is not valid. Let's re-examine the problem.

We know that Billy spent half of his change on gumballs, which cost $2 (40 gumballs * $0.05). This means he had $4 in change after buying the candy. So, the equation becomes:

10 - 1.5x = 4

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get:

-1.5x = -6

Dividing both sides by -1.5, we get:

x = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S. We are given that Carver is 45 years old, so C = 45.

We are also given that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. This can be expressed as an equation:

C = 2S - 5

Substituting C = 45 into the equation, we get:

45 = 2S - 5

To solve for S, we need to isolate S on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding 5 to both sides:

45 + 5 = 2S - 5 + 5
50 = 2S

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for S:

50 / 2 = 2S / 2
25 = S

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to add the distances between the three cities. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles, and the distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. 

The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs, which is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. So, the distance from the third city to the first city is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance for one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 3 * 300 = 900 miles.

To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance the train can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the total distance it travels in a day (900 miles).

18,000 / 900 = 20 days.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 / 70
Time = 2.857 hours (approximately)

However, he took a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. So, the actual distance traveled to his friend's house is 200 + 10 = 210 miles. 

Time taken for the detour part = 10 / 70
Time taken for the detour part = 0.143 hours (approximately)

Total time taken to reach his friend's house = 2.857 + 0.143 = 2.999 hours (approximately)

Now, let's calculate the time taken for the trip back home. The distance is 240 miles and the speed is 80 mph.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 240 / 80
Time = 3 hours

Total time taken for the trip = Time taken to reach his friend's house + Time taken to come back home
Total time taken for the trip = 2.999 + 3

"Let's break down the information given:

1. 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 
   Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting as S. 
   We can write the equation: S = 4 * 3 - 5
   S = 12 - 5
   S = 7
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 
   Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as V. 
   We can write the equation: V = 3 * S
   V = 3 * 7
   V = 21
4. If a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, we can write the equation: 
   Total = 3 (refusing to wear masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) + X (other reasons)
   50 = 3 + 7 + 21 + X
   50 = 31 + X
   X = 50 - 31
   X = 19

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many points Erin has now. Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, and Sara scored 8 points, we can calculate Erin's current points as follows:

Erin's current points = 3 * Sara's points
Erin's current points = 3 * 8
Erin's current points = 24

Now, we know that Erin scored 14 points and has a total of 24 points. To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to subtract the points she scored from her current total:

Erin's previous points = Erin's current points - points scored
Erin's previous points = 24 - 14
Erin's previous points = 10

"To find the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. There are 44 seniors, and each picture frame costs $20. So, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of etching the logo on each picture frame. The etching costs an additional 20% of the cost of the picture frame, which is 20% of $20 = 0.2 * $20 = $4. So, the total cost of etching is 44 * $4 = $176.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the pins. 2 seniors will receive pins, and each pin costs $5. So, the total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the cords. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 1/4 * 44 = 11 officers. Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12. So, the total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we can add up the costs of the picture frames, etching, pins, and cords to find the total cost of the senior gifts. The total cost is $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final answer is: $1198"
"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we first need to calculate the materials cost. Since the DIY saves 20% of the market price, the materials cost is 80% of the market price.

The market price is $400. 
To find 80% of $400, we multiply $400 by 0.8 (since 100% - 20% = 80%).

Materials cost = $400 * 0.8 = $320

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is the materials cost.

The final answer is: $320"
"To find the total number of tennis shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold on each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did the day before, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit, so we need to subtract 12 (6 pairs) from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday.

Total shoes sold on Sunday = 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add the number of shoes sold on each day: 
14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, we multiply the total number of pairs by 2 to get the total number of shoes sold.

Total shoes sold = 50 * 2 = 100.

"To find the number of pupils who like the color yellow, we need to first find the number of pupils who like blue, then the number of pupils who like green, and finally subtract the sum of these two from the total number of pupils.

First, half of the class likes blue. Since there are 40 pupils in the class, half of them would be 40 / 2 = 20 pupils who like blue.

Now, one-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. The remaining pupils after excluding those who like blue are 40 - 20 = 20. One-fourth of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5 pupils who like green.

Now, we subtract the sum of pupils who like blue and green from the total number of pupils to find the number of pupils who like yellow. This would be 40 - (20 + 5) = 40 - 25 = 15.

On Monday, Lucy sold all the apples picked, but we don't know the number of apples picked. However, we do know that she made $56 from selling them at $4 per piece. So, we can find the number of apples picked on Monday by dividing the total amount earned by the price per apple:

$56 / $4 = 14 apples

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked over the three days by adding the number of apples picked each day:

"To find the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total interest paid over the five months and then divide it by the number of months.

The formula for simple interest is: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Given:
Principal (P) = $3,650
Rate (R) = 10% or 0.10
Time (T) = 5 months

Interest = P * R * T
= $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
= $1,825

Now, we need to find the total amount Karan has to pay, which is the principal plus the interest:
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
= $3,650 + $1,825
= $5,475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, we divide the total amount by the number of months:
Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Number of Months
= $5,475 / 5

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the total number of silver pesos and gold pesos they have separately and then add them together.

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so Anna has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos.

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so Anna has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's add the total number of silver pesos and gold pesos they have together:
Total silver pesos = 50 (Axel's silver pesos) + 100 (Anna's silver pesos) = 150
Total gold pesos = 80 (Axel's gold pesos) + 120 (Anna's gold pesos) = 200

The total number of pesos they have together is the sum of the total silver pesos and total gold pesos:
Total pesos = Total silver pesos + Total gold pesos = 150 + 200 = 350

"To find the profit per hour, we need to first find the total revenue and the total cost.

The total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make is 3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups.

The total revenue is the number of cups sold multiplied by the price per cup, which is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

The total cost is $18.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $36 - $18 = $18.

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, the profit per hour is the total profit divided by the number of hours, which is $18 / 4 cups/hour = $4.5 per hour.

"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we can use the concept of proportions. If he sold 3/5 of his land, then the fraction of land he has left is 1 - 3/5 = 2/5.

Let's denote the initial amount of land as x hectares. We know that 2/5 of x is equal to 12.8 hectares. We can set up the equation:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land initially.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the number of female members in the choir, we first need to calculate 50% of the total members. 

50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26

Since there are 26 female members, and half of them can't make it to the show, we need to find half of 26.

Half of 26 = 26 / 2 = 13

Now, we have 13 female members who can make it to the show. The choir's 3 teachers will also be singing, so we need to add them to the number of female members.

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu.

First, let's find the number of messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and the number of messages to Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given ratio. Let's assume the number of popsicles Betty has is 5x and the number of popsicles Sam has is 6x.

Since the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, we can write the equation:

5x + 6x = 165

Combine like terms:

11x = 165

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 15

Now that we know x, we can find the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have:

Betty has 5x = 5(15) = 75 popsicles
Sam has 6x = 6(15) = 90 popsicles

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

90 - 75 = 15

"To find the total cost of the streaming services, we need to calculate the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus. 

The normal cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, so together they cost $20. 

Since Tim saves 20% by bundling, we need to find 20% of $20. 
20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4

So, the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (bundled Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

To find the amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his cable package, we subtract the total cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package: 
$60 (cable package) - $26 (streaming services) = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total time spent, we need to add up the time spent writing, recording, and editing the song. 

Time spent writing: 4 hours

The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so the total number of books it can hold is the product of the number of rows and the number of columns: 6 * 6 = 36.

Now, we need to find double the number of books in the shelving system, which is 2 * 36 = 72.

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books, so we add 20 to the double of the number of books: 72 + 20 = 92.

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

The final answer is: 92"
"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica has now, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, added to the cards her dad brought, and then subtract the cards she passed out and add the cards she received.

Initially, Erica made 20 Valentine's cards.

Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards that had 15 cards each, so she received 2 * 15 = 30 cards.

She initially had 20 cards, and her dad brought 30, so she had 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so she gave away 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

She had 50 cards and gave away 29, so she had 50 - 29 = 21 cards left.

She received 17 cards from family and friends, so she now has 21 + 17 = 38 cards.

"To find out how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for the quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, we multiply the ingredients by 4:

- Flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
- Milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark will need to buy:
12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark will need to buy:
4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk

First, we need to find out how many sandwiches are needed to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide 20 by 4:

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we need a total of 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so the total cost of the meat is:
5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so the total cost of the cheese is:
5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first determine how many steps he had completed before the jog. 

Elliott finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since he wants to walk 10,000 steps, half of that would be 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.

He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, the total steps completed before the jog would be 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Since he had 2,000 steps left to take after the jog, we can find the total steps taken before and after the jog by adding the steps left to the steps completed before the jog: 6,000 + 2,000 = 8,000 steps.

However, this is not the total steps he took, but rather the total steps he had to take. To find the steps taken during the jog, we need to subtract the steps completed before the jog from the total steps he had to take: 10,000 - 8,000 = 2,000 steps.

The final answer is: 2,000"
"To find out how many minutes Toby will be early, we need to calculate the total time it takes for him to read the book and travel to the airport.

First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book: 
45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words

Next, we'll find out how long it takes Toby to read the book:
9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

Now, we'll add the time it takes to get to the airport:
30 minutes (reading time) + 10 minutes (travel time) = 40 minutes

Since Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to leave, we'll subtract the total time from the available time:
60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

Toby will be 20 minutes early."
"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately and then add them together.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 * $2400 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees left. So, the company had 40 - 10 = 30 employees in June. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in June is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

The final answer is: $168,000"
"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought and subtract that from the initial amount of money she had.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means that for every 2 pounds of taffy, she pays $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound (since 1/2 off is the same as paying half the price). So, the cost of 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. She bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally initially had $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total amount spent by Tim, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks and the finale firework separately and then add them together.

The first package of fireworks costs $400, and the second package costs twice that much, which is 2 * $400 = $800. 

The total cost of the fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Since Tim gets a 20% discount on the fireworks, we need to calculate the discount amount first. The discount amount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.2 * $1200 = $240.

The discounted cost of the fireworks is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted cost of the fireworks. The total amount spent by Tim is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To find out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she will eat in 30 days and then divide that by the number of cookies her recipe makes.

Shannon eats 2 cookies per night, so in 30 days, she will eat 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she will eat by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs to make.

60 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5 dozens

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days. 

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. 

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. 5% of 50,000 candles smell like wet dog, so the number of candles that smell like wet dog is 0.05 * 50,000 = 2500.

However, we are told that these candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode. This means that 1% of the candles that smell like wet dog will explode. So, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 0.01 * 2500 = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to find the price of each blouse after the 30% discount. 

The discount amount is 30% of the regular price, which is 0.3 * $20 = $6. 

So, the discounted price of each blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is 4 * $14 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees as x.

Since Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees and her sister gathered twice as many, her sister gathered 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.

Joanne gathered half the amount from the shortest trees as she did from the tallest trees, which is 30 / 2 = 15 apples. Her sister gathered 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so her sister gathered 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

The total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is 30 + 15 = 45 for Joanne and 60 + 45 = 105 for her sister.

The total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is 45 + 105 = 150 for both sisters.

Since the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - 150 = 350.

The number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is x = 350 / 2 = 175.

x = 175"
"Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. We are given two pieces of information:

1. The total number of heads is 180, which means C + D = 180.
2. The total number of bumps is 304, which means 2C + D = 304 (since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump).

We can solve this system of linear equations by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can find the number of dromedaries by substituting C into the first equation:

D = 180 - C
D = 180 - 124
D = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd.

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down the problem into parts.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the first 4 days:
Distance = 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled over the next two days, which is 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days:
Distance = 30% * 800 km = 0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

Now, let's add the distance traveled on the next day, which is 0 km (he wasn't traveling at all).

Now, let's calculate the distance traveled during the second week:
Distance = 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Finally, let's add up all the distances to find the total distance traveled by Tom:
Total Distance = 800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The final answer is: 3140"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work backwards from Peter's locker size. 

Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can find Zack's locker size by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4.

Zack's locker size = 5 * 4 = 20 cubic inches

Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can find Timothy's locker size by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size = 20 * 2 = 40 cubic inches

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the elevation where Stanley's comb fell, we need to subtract the distance it fell from Stanley's initial elevation. 

Stanley's initial elevation: 10,000 feet
Distance the comb fell: 4,000 feet
Elevation where the comb fell: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the distance Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb. To do this, we subtract Oliver's current elevation from the elevation where the comb fell.

Oliver's current elevation: 3,000 feet
Elevation where the comb fell: 6,000 feet
Distance Oliver must climb: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital. The first bank gave him $4000, so now he has:

$5000 (initial capital) + $4000 (from the first bank) = $9000

The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000. Now, we add this amount to the total:

$9000 + $8000 = $17000

So, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital.

$17000"
"To find the number of cats left on the rock, we first need to determine the number of cats taken away by the boats and then subtract that from the initial number of cats. 

Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats taken away by the boats is 4 * 5 = 20.

Now, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30.

After the boats left, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find the number of cats that ran after the mouse, we multiply the remaining cats by 3/5: 30 * (3/5) = 18.

Now, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different periods and calculate the cost for each period.

1. The first 6 months cost $8 per month, so the total cost for this period is 6 * $8 = $48.
2. The next 8 months cost $12 per month, so the total cost for this period is 8 * $12 = $96.
3. After that, the price increased to $14 per month. Since 2 years is 24 months, and we've already accounted for 14 months, there are 24 - 14 = 10 months left. The cost for this period is 10 * $14 = $140.

Now, let's add up the costs for each period: $48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

The final answer is: $284"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let the cost of the jogger jeans be x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, we can write an equation:

x = 28 - 6
x = 22

So, the jogger jeans cost $22.

The total savings is $6, and Cole saved 1/3 of this from the jogger jeans. Let's find the savings from the jogger jeans:

Savings from jogger jeans = (1/3) * 6
Savings from jogger jeans = 2

Since the rest of the savings came from the tattered jeans, we can find the savings from the tattered jeans:

Savings from tattered jeans = 6 - 2
Savings from tattered jeans = 4

The savings from the tattered jeans is 4 dollars, and the cost of the tattered jeans is 28 dollars. We can find the original price of the tattered jeans by adding the savings to the cost:

Original price of tattered jeans = 28 + 4
Original price of tattered jeans = 32

Now, we can find the difference in cost between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans:

Difference in cost = Original price of tattered jeans - Cost of jogger jeans
Difference in cost = 32 - 22
Difference in cost = 10

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of birds that visit the bird feeders each day. 

First, let's find the number of birds that visit the store-bought bird feeders. Since there are 3 store-bought bird feeders and each attracts 20 birds, the total number of birds visiting the store-bought bird feeders is 3 * 20 = 60.

Next, let's find the number of birds that visit the bird feeders made by Lillian. Since each of these bird feeders attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, each of Lillian's bird feeders attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds. There are 3 bird feeders made by Lillian, so the total number of birds visiting these bird feeders is 3 * 30 = 90.

Now, we add the number of birds visiting the store-bought bird feeders and the number of birds visiting Lillian's bird feeders to find the total number of birds visiting the garden each day. Total birds = 60 + 90 = 150.

"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The bagel costs $4. 
The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find 25% of $4, we multiply $4 by 0.25, which is $1. Then, we add this to the cost of the bagel: $4 + $1 = $5. 
The cake costs half the price of the bagel, which is $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, we add the costs of the bagel, soup, and cake together: $4 + $5 + $2 = $11.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cards Kenny sold to get the remaining $50. Since he sold the cards for $1.5 each, we can set up an equation to represent the situation.

Let's say Kenny started with x cards. He kept 1/3 of them, so he sold 2/3 of them. The amount of money he got from selling the cards is equal to the number of cards he sold multiplied by the price per card.

The equation is: (2/3)x * 1.5 = 50

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 50 * (3/2) / 1.5
x = 50 * 3 / 3 * 2 / 1.5
x = 50 * 2 / 1.5
x = 100 / 1.5
x = 66.67

Since we can't have a fraction of a card, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the total number of cards he started with, so we need to add the cards he kept to the cards he sold.

Kenny kept 1/3 of the cards, so the number of cards he kept is (1/3)x. We already know that x = 66.67, so the number of cards he kept is (1/3) * 66.67 = 22.22.

The number of cards he sold is 2/3x = 2/3 * 66.67 = 44.44.

The total number of cards he started with is the sum of the cards he kept and the cards he sold: 22.22 + 44.44 = 66.66.

However, since we are looking for the total number of cards he started with, we round up to the nearest whole number because we can't have a fraction of a card.

"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we first need to find half of the number of letters in Indras' name. 

Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3.

Since her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, we add 4 to 3, which is 3 + 4 = 7.

Now, we need to find the total number of letters in both names. We add the number of letters in Indras' name (6) to the number of letters in her sister's name (7), which is 6 + 7 = 13.

"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount and then apply the 20% discount.

The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00.
The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00.
The cost of the 5 separate utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost of the items before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

To apply the 20% discount, we need to find 20% of $165.00, which is 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

The discount amount is $33.00, so we subtract this from the total cost: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to determine how much gas was in one container. Since 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, we can find the amount in one container by dividing 15 gallons by 5.

15 gallons / 5 = 3 gallons per container

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we can convert the 3 gallons to pints by multiplying 3 by 8.

3 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 24 pints

Josey needed 1/4 of a container, so we need to find 1/4 of 24 pints.

1/4 * 24 pints = 6 pints

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George had initially. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can set up the equation:

Initial money - 5 = 0.01 * Initial money

Let's solve for the initial money:

Initial money - 5 = 0.01 * Initial money
Initial money - 0.01 * Initial money = 5
0.99 * Initial money = 5
Initial money = 5 / 0.99
Initial money = 5.05

Now that we know George had $5.05 initially, we can find out how much he spent on chips. Since he bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, the total cost of chips is:

3 * 0.40 = 1.20

Now, we subtract the cost of chips from the initial money to find out how much he spent on candy bars:

5.05 - 1.20 = 3.85

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can find out how many candy bars he bought by dividing the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of each candy bar:

3.85 / 0.75 = 5.13

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can buy 5 candy bars with $3.75 and have $0.10 left, which is not enough to buy another candy bar. Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to first determine how many lollipops he shared with his friends. 

Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself, so the number of lollipops he shared is 25 - 5 = 20.

Since he shared the lollipops equally among his 4 friends, we divide the number of lollipops shared by the number of friends: 20 / 4 = 5.

So, each of his friends received 5 lollipops.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the remaining weight of the cake, we first need to determine the total weight of the pieces that Rory and her mom each have. 

Since there are 8 pieces in total and each piece is equal in weight, we can divide the total weight of the cake by the number of pieces to find the weight of each piece. 

Weight of each piece = Total weight of the cake / Number of pieces
Weight of each piece = 20 ounces / 8
Weight of each piece = 2.5 ounces

Now, since Rory and her mom each have a piece, we need to find the total weight of the two pieces they have. 

Total weight of the pieces they have = 2 * Weight of each piece
Total weight of the pieces they have = 2 * 2.5 ounces
Total weight of the pieces they have = 5 ounces

To find the remaining weight of the cake, we subtract the total weight of the pieces they have from the total weight of the cake.

Remaining weight of the cake = Total weight of the cake - Total weight of the pieces they have
Remaining weight of the cake = 20 ounces - 5 ounces
Remaining weight of the cake = 15 ounces

Since they are sharing the oranges with 6 other friends, including themselves, the total number of people sharing the oranges is 8 (Sitti, Juris, and 6 friends).

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people.

Oranges per person = Total oranges / Total people

"To find the cost per serving, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and divide it by the number of servings.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the onions. Antoine wants to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of onions is $2.00 per pound, so the total cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the beef stock. Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is the sum of the cost of onions and beef stock, which is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Since the soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is the total cost divided by the number of servings: $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Bernadette to get to the theater and then determine how much earlier she needs to leave than Wayne.

Let's denote the time it takes for Wayne to get to the theater as W. We are given that W = 4 minutes.

Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, the time it takes for Bernadette to get to the theater is 4W. 

4W = 4 * 4 = 16 minutes

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne. Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to leave 4 + 5 = 9 minutes before Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. Since the area of the room is given as 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we need to convert the length to feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so the length in feet is 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length times width (A = lw). We can rearrange this formula to solve for the width: w = A / l. Plugging in the values, we get w = 360 / 9 = 40 feet.

Now that we have the width, we can find the perimeter of the room using the formula P = 2l + 2w. Plugging in the values, we get P = 2(9) + 2(40) = 18 + 80 = 98 feet.

The final answer is: 98"
"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister has.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, Elizabeth has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, Margareth has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, we need to find the difference between the total number of beads each sister has:
Difference = Total beads Margareth has - Total beads Elizabeth has

"To find the final temperature of the house, we need to calculate the temperature increase due to the oven and the temperature decrease due to the open window.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven:

The oven is on for 3 hours, and it raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, the total temperature increase is:
3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

Now, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the open window:

The window is open for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes, so for 30 minutes, it cools down:
(30 minutes / 10 minutes) * 2 degrees = 6 degrees

Now, let's calculate the final temperature of the house:
Initial temperature = 40 degrees
Temperature increase due to oven = 15 degrees
Temperature decrease due to window = 6 degrees

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon. 

Jon's total time = 40 minutes (swim) + 80 minutes (1 hour 20 minutes) + 50 minutes (run) = 170 minutes.

Since James finishes the swim 10% faster, we need to find 10% of Jon's swim time and subtract it from Jon's swim time. 
10% of 40 minutes = 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes. 
So, James' swim time = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so James' bike time = 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so the difference in their total times is 10 minutes. 
Let's denote James' run time as x. 
Then, the equation becomes: 
170 (Jon's total time) - x (James' run time) = 10 (the difference in their times)
170 - x = 10
x = 160 minutes.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then calculate one-fourth of that length.

Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total amount of hay the horse eats, we first need to find the distance it runs. Since the horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH, we need to convert the time to hours. 

30 minutes is 30/60 = 0.5 hours.

Now, we can find the distance by multiplying the speed by the time: 
Distance = Speed * Time = 32MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, it will eat 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail costs $3, so the total cost of hay is 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of 6 * $5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the cost of hay from the total amount of money: 
Change = $30 - $24 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many trays Rozanne can put out, we first need to determine the total number of eggs she has. 

Rozanne uses 4 dozen eggs from cases. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs would be 4 * 12 = 48 eggs.

She also uses 2 loose eggs from the cupboard. 

So, the total number of eggs is 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs, so the total number of glasses she can make is 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, so the total number of trays she can put out is 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

The final answer is: 2"

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from the sale of the sneakers and subtract the initial cost.

First, let's find the revenue from the flash sale on Monday. The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each, so the revenue from the flash sale is:
17 * $20 = $340

Next, let's find the revenue from the sale to the department store. The salesman sold the remaining 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers for $25 each, so the revenue from the department store sale is:
31 * $25 = $775

The total revenue from both sales is:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The initial cost of the case of sneakers was $576. To find the profit, we subtract the initial cost from the total revenue:
$1115 - $576 = $539

The salesman's profit is $539."

Next, let's calculate the total number of crayons in the four packets with 16 pieces each:
4 packets * 16 crayons/packet = 64 crayons

Now, we add the total number of crayons from both types of packets to find the overall total:
48 crayons + 64 crayons = 112 crayons

The final answer is: 112"
"Let's break down the information given. 

If you buy a super ticket for $20, you get a movie ticket and one popcorn with a soda for $1 extra. This means the total cost of the movie ticket and the combo of popcorn and soda is $20 - $1 = $19.

If you buy a movie ticket for $12 and a combo of popcorn and soda at regular price, the total cost is $12 + (popcorn price + soda price). 

Since you saved $2 by buying the super ticket, the total cost of the movie ticket and the combo of popcorn and soda is $19 - $2 = $17.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the situation: 
12 + (popcorn price + 3) = 17

Subtract 12 from both sides of the equation: 
(popcorn price + 3) = 5

Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: 
popcorn price = 2

The regular price of popcorn is $2. 

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as x. Since the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, we can set up the equation:

20x = 900

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

x = 900 / 20
x = 45

So, the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, so the new cost of filling one balloon is:

New cost = Original cost + Increase
New cost = 45 + 20
New cost = 65

Now, we need to find the total cost of filling 170 balloons at the new cost. 

Total cost = New cost * Number of balloons
Total cost = 65 * 170
Total cost = 11050

The final answer is: 11050"
"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 mph x 2 hours = 120 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour:
Distance = Speed x Time = 30 mph x 1 hour = 30 miles

Now, let's find the total distance traveled:
Total Distance = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

The total time taken is the sum of the time taken at 60 mph and 30 mph:
Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Finally, we can calculate the average speed:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph

"To find the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of apples they eat per day and then multiply it by 30.

Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. So, together they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples per day.

Now, we multiply the total number of apples they eat per day by 30 to find the total number of apples they eat in 30 days: 8 * 30 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds.

The volume of one raised bed is calculated as length * width * height. 
Volume = 2 feet * 8 feet * 2 feet = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:
Total Volume = 32 cubic feet/bed * 10 beds = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. To find the number of bags needed, we divide the total volume by the volume of one bag:
Number of bags = Total Volume / Volume per bag = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:
Total Cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag = 160 bags * $12/bag = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of cards, we first need to determine the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of red cards = 15
60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add the number of puppies Jennifer's dog has to the number of puppies Brandon's dog has. 

Total puppies = 8 (Jennifer's puppies) + 12 (Brandon's puppies) = 20

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. 

Puppies with spots = 3 (Jennifer's puppies with spots) + 4 (Brandon's puppies with spots) = 7

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

The final answer is: 35"
"To find the total number of trips the farmer needs to make, we need to calculate the total weight of all the feed and divide it by the capacity of the farm truck.

First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up the total weight of all the feed:
2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips:
3400 / 2250 = 1.511 (round up to the nearest whole number since we can't make a fraction of a trip)

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the total earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately and then add them together.

Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week. Since an aluminum can is worth 2 cents, her weekly earnings from aluminum cans are 3 * 2 = 6 cents.

Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week. Since a plastic bottle is worth 3 cents, her weekly earnings from plastic bottles are 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

In a four-week month, Grayson's total earnings from aluminum cans are 6 * 4 = 24 cents.

In a four-week month, Grayson's total earnings from plastic bottles are 15 * 4 = 60 cents.

Now, we add the total earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles to find the total earnings in a four-week month: 24 + 60 = 84 cents.

"To find the number of plants Shondra has, we need to first determine the number of plants Toni has, and then subtract 7 from that number.

Since Frederick has 10 plants and Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has as follows:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find the number of plants Shondra has by subtracting 7 from Toni's total:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

Number of cookies = (1/2)x + 2

Since Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable. First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

6 inches / 12 = 0.5 feet

Since there are two remoras, we multiply the length of one remora by 2.

0.5 feet * 2 = 1 foot

Now, we add the length of the remoras to the length of the shark.

10 feet (shark) + 1 foot (remoras) = 11 feet

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy, we divide the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100.

Now, we need to find the number of kids allergic to at least one thing. Since we know that 3 kids are allergic to both, we need to add the number of kids allergic to only dairy and the number of kids allergic to only peanuts to the number of kids allergic to both.

Number of kids allergic to at least one thing = Number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts + Number of kids allergic to only dairy + Number of kids allergic to only peanuts
We know that the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts is 12, and the number of kids allergic to both is 3. To find the number of kids allergic to only dairy, we subtract the number of kids allergic to both from the number of kids allergic to dairy: 9 - 3 = 6. To find the number of kids allergic to only peanuts, we subtract the number of kids allergic to both from the number of kids allergic to peanuts: 6 - 3 = 3.

Number of kids allergic to at least one thing = 12 + 6 + 3

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to find the weight of the 2010 penny. 

Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can set up an equation to find its weight. Let's denote the weight of the 2010 penny as x. 

The equation is: x = (3/4) * 48

To solve for x, we multiply 48 by 3 and then divide by 4. 

x = (3 * 48) / 4
x = 144 / 4
x = 36

So, the 2010 penny weighs 36 grains.

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding the weights of the 1959 penny and the 2010 penny.

"To find out how many songs Luri can add to his player, we need to first determine how many songs he currently has. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, Luri has 3 * 20 = 60 songs.

Now, we need to find out how many songs each can add to their player. Since each player can store up to 100 songs, Gabriel can add 100 - 20 = 80 songs, and Luri can add 100 - 60 = 40 songs.

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add than Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add: 80 - 40 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we first need to find out how many oranges he ate. Since Stetson ate 2/5 of the oranges and they picked 60 oranges, we can calculate the number of oranges he ate as follows:

Number of oranges eaten = (2/5) * 60
= (2 * 60) / 5
= 120 / 5
= 24

Since Stetson gave up $10 for each orange he ate, we can multiply the number of oranges he ate by the amount he gave up per orange:

Total amount given up = Number of oranges eaten * Amount per orange
= 24 * 10
= 240

The final answer is: $240"
"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we need to first calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes. 

Cost of shoes = $80
3 times the cost of shoes = 3 * $80 = $240

Since the handbag cost $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes, we subtract $20 from $240.

Cost of handbag = 3 times the cost of shoes - $20
= $240 - $20
= $220

The final answer is: $220"
"To find the total number of hours James runs a week, we need to first find the total number of miles he runs in a week. 

James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of miles he runs in a week is 12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week.

Since James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour, we can find the total number of hours he runs in a week by dividing the total number of miles by his speed.

Total hours = Total miles / Speed
Total hours = 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour
Total hours = 6 hours/week

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total number of bags of oats needed, we need to calculate the total amount of oats consumed by the horses in five days.

First, let's find the total amount of oats consumed per day:

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and there are 2 meals per day, so each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since there are 4 horses, the total amount of oats consumed per day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

To find the total amount of oats consumed in five days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5:

40 * 5 = 200 pounds

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we need to divide the total amount of oats consumed in five days by the weight of one bag:

200 / 50 = 4

So, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the number of girl Pomeranians, we first need to find the total number of Pomeranians. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can calculate this as follows:

Total puppies = 27
Pomeranians = (2/3) * Total puppies
Pomeranians = (2/3) * 27
Pomeranians = 18

Now, we need to find the number of girl Pomeranians. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can calculate this as follows:

Girl Pomeranians = (1/3) * Pomeranians
Girl Pomeranians = (1/3) * 18
Girl Pomeranians = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the average highest temperature, we need to add up the highest temperatures of the three countries and divide by 3.

First, let's add up the temperatures: 
-48 (Southlandia) + 21 (Northlandia) + (-3) (Midlandia) = -30

Now, we divide the sum by 3:
-30 / 3 = -10

The average highest temperature of the three countries is -10 degrees Fahrenheit."
"To find out how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we need to calculate the remaining amount first. 

The toy car costs $12, and the child already has $4 savings. So, the remaining amount is $12 - $4 = $8.

The child promises to save $2 daily from his allowance. To find out how many days it will take to save the remaining amount, we can divide the remaining amount by the daily savings.

$8 (remaining amount) ÷ $2 (daily savings) = 4 days

"To find out how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we need to calculate the total capacity of the trays and subtract the number of eggs he has.

Each tray can hold 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays, so the total capacity is 24 * 2 = 48 eggs.

Jaime has 64 eggs, but the trays can only hold 48 eggs. To find out how many eggs won't fit, we subtract the capacity from the number of eggs: 64 - 48 = 16.

So, Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the tray.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total amount Sally spends, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza first. Since it costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, and the small pizza costs $8, the family-size pizza costs 3 * $8 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of the small pizza to the cost of the family-size pizza to find the total amount spent: $8 + $24 = $32.

The final answer is: $32"
"To find the cost per individual razor after the discount, we need to first calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon.

Since the razors are buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. 

Heather also has a $2.00 coupon, so she will get a discount of $2.00.

The total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

The cost per individual razor is $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each level and add them up.

The 4 girls on the bottom are 64"" tall each, so their total height is 4 * 64 = 256"".

The 3 girls on top of the 4 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 3 * 64 = 192"".

The 2 girls on top of the 3 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 2 * 64 = 128"".

The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, we add up the heights of all the levels: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 536"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 536"" / 12 = 44.67 feet.

The final answer is: 44.67"
"To find the total number of minutes Charisma walked, we need to calculate the total number of 5-minute breaks she took in a day and then multiply it by the number of days she worked.

Charisma works 8 hours a day, and she takes a 5-minute break every hour. So, the total number of 5-minute breaks in a day is 8 hours * 1 break per hour = 8 breaks per day.

Since each break is 5 minutes long, the total number of minutes she walked in a day is 8 breaks * 5 minutes per break = 40 minutes per day.

Charisma worked for 5 days, so the total number of minutes she walked is 40 minutes per day * 5 days = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Angela's current age be x.

In four years, Angela's age will be x + 4.

According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is 14 years old now, in four years, he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.

So, we can set up the equation: x + 4 = 3(14)

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 4 = 42

Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get: x = 38

Therefore, Angela's current age is 38 years old.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides separately, and then add them together.

The cost of the morning rides is the cost per ride multiplied by the number of rides: $6/ride * 14 rides = $84.

The cost of the afternoon rides is the cost per ride multiplied by the number of rides: $2/ride * 14 rides = $28.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides: $84 + $28 = $112.

"To find the total number of oranges, we first need to determine the total number of oranges Ashley and Brianne brought. 

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so Ashley brought 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne brought 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

The total number of oranges is 50 (Ashley's oranges) + 70 (Brianne's oranges) = 120 oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, the number of pies they can make is 120 / 3 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

For the first venue, the total cost is the flat fee of $200 plus the cost of food for each guest, which is $5x. So, the total cost for the first venue is 200 + 5x.

For the second venue, the total cost is the cost per guest, which is $25x, since food is already included.

To find the number of guests for which the two venues are equal in cost, we set the two expressions equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtracting 5x from both sides gives us:

200 = 20x

Dividing both sides by 20 gives us:

10 = x

"Let's denote the number of insects found by Bodhi as B, David as D, and Lily as L. 

We are given that L = D + 7 and D = B/2. 

We also know that L + D + B = 43.

Substituting the first equation into the third, we get (D + 7) + D + B = 43. 

Simplifying, we get 2D + B + 7 = 43.

Substituting D = B/2 into the equation, we get 2(B/2) + B + 7 = 43.

Simplifying, we get B + B + 7 = 43.

Combine like terms, we get 2B + 7 = 43.

Subtract 7 from both sides, we get 2B = 36.

Divide both sides by 2, we get B = 18.

Now that we know B, we can find D. D = B/2 = 18/2 = 9.

Now that we know D, we can find L. L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16.

"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to calculate the yards used by Mariah and her grandma separately and then add them together.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein. To find the yards used by Mariah, we multiply 364 yards by 1/4.

364 yards * 1/4 = 364 yards * 0.25 = 91 yards

Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein, which is the same as 2/4. To find the yards used by her grandma, we multiply 364 yards by 2/4.

364 yards * 2/4 = 364 yards * 0.5 = 182 yards

Now, we add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma together.

91 yards + 182 yards = 273 yards

The final answer is: 273"
"To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the number of gifts for her friends and add the 10 random gifts.

First, let's calculate the number of gifts for her friends. 2 friends want 5 gifts each, so the total number of gifts for these friends is 2 * 5 = 10. The other 3 friends want 2 gifts each, so the total number of gifts for these friends is 3 * 2 = 6.

Now, let's add the number of gifts for her friends: 10 + 6 = 16.

Finally, we add the 10 random gifts: 16 + 10 = 26.

The total number of gifts Cherrie bought is 26."
"To find the length of the couch, we first need to find the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, and the chair is 3 feet wide, the rug's width is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. Adding 2 feet to this gives us the length of the couch: 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total.
- 2 packs are strawberry gum.
- 1 pack is grape gum, which costs $2.
- 1 pack is green apple gum, which costs half as much as the grape gum, so it costs $2 / 2 = $1.
- The total cost of all 4 packs is $7.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Let S be the cost of each pack of strawberry gum.

The total cost of all 4 packs is the sum of the costs of each individual pack:
2S (strawberry) + 2 (grape) + 1 (green apple) = 7

Combine like terms:
2S + 3 = 7

Subtract 3 from both sides:
2S = 4

Divide both sides by 2:
S = 2

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2.

"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives him the most sticks per dollar spent. 

Let's calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood:

For a 2 x 4 piece of wood, Frederick can get 200 sticks for $4. 
Cost per stick = $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick

For a 2 x 8 piece of wood, Frederick can get 400 sticks for $6.
Cost per stick = $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick

Since the 2 x 8 piece of wood gives him the most sticks per dollar, we should prioritize buying this type of wood. 

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with his $24:

Number of 2 x 8 pieces of wood = $24 / $6 = 4

Since each 2 x 8 piece of wood gives him 400 sticks, the total number of sticks he can make is:

Total sticks = 4 * 400 = 1600

The final answer is: 1600"
"To find the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs, we need to first determine the total number of snowshoes required. Since each dog has 4 legs and Mario has 6 dogs, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24.

Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, the total number of snowshoes required is equal to the total number of legs, which is 24. However, since snowshoes come in pairs, we need to divide the total number of snowshoes by 2 to get the total number of pairs. 

24 / 2 = 12

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of pairs of snowshoes by the cost per pair, which is $12.00.

12 * 12 = 144

"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week and then subtract the cost of the weekly pass.

Janet takes two bus trips per day, five days a week. So, the total number of bus trips per week is 2 * 5 = 10.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost of her bus trips for a week is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

The weekly bus pass costs $20. To find out how much Janet would save, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of her bus trips: $22 - $20 = $2.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. This means the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in the farm and the zoo:

Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

Total number of animals in the farm and the zoo combined: 40 + 80 = 120

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many items Sophia bought. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of items Sophia bought, we can let the number of items Sophia bought be 'x'. 

We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, which is a total of 16 items. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of items Sophia bought, we can set up the equation:

4x = 16

To solve for 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 16 / 4
x = 4

So, Sophia bought 4 items. Since we don't know whether the 4 items are onions or potatoes, we can assume that the 4 items are a combination of both. However, we can say that Sophia bought 4 items in total.

The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 4.

"To find the number of days Andy has to reach his goal, we need to calculate the difference between his birthday and today's date. 

December has 31 days, and his birthday is on the 19th of July, which is the 7th month. So, we need to calculate the days from December 31st to July 19th.

December has 31 days, so from December 31st to December 31st is 0 days. 
January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. 
February has 28 days (assuming a non-leap year), so from February 1st to February 28th is 28 days. 
March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days. 
April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 30th is 30 days. 
May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 31st is 31 days. 
June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 30th is 30 days. 
July has 19 days, so from July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Total days = 0 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 180 days

Now, we need to find the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 pounds. Since he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, the total calories he needs to burn is:
Total calories = 30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories by the number of days:
Daily calorie deficit = Total calories / Total days
= 105,000 calories / 180 days
= 583.33 calories/day

The final answer is: $\boxed{583.33}$"

Gerald has $110 left."
"To find the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we need to calculate the total distance she will run and then multiply it by the amount of water she needs to drink per kilometer.

First, let's find the total distance Hannah will run. Since each lap is 0.25 km and she needs to run 8 laps, we can multiply the number of laps by the distance per lap:

Total distance = Number of laps * Distance per lap
Total distance = 8 * 0.25 km
Total distance = 2 km

Now, we know Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. To find the total amount of water she needs to drink, we can multiply the total distance by the amount of water per kilometer:

Total water needed = Total distance * Water per kilometer
Total water needed = 2 km * 60 ml/km
Total water needed = 120 ml

"To find the amount of money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs, and then subtract that from the initial amount.

First, Julie spent 20% of $500 on clothes. 
20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

Now, we subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount:
$500 - $100 = $400

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs.
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

Now, we subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount:
$400 - $100 = $300

So, Julie had $300 left.

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:

4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 30,000

Since the cost of the house is 3x, we can find the cost of the house by multiplying x by 3:

Cost of the house = 3x = 3(30,000) = 90,000

The final answer is: $90,000"
"To find the profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The total cost is the cost of the canvas bags, which is 8 packs * 5 bags per pack * $4 per bag = 8 * 5 * 4 = $160.

The total revenue is the selling price of the bags, which is 8 bags * $8 per bag = 8 * 8 = $64.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $64 - $160 = -$96.

However, since profit cannot be negative, it seems there is an error in the problem. The selling price of $8 per bag is less than the cost price of $4 per bag, which is not possible. 

Assuming the selling price is actually higher than the cost price, let's recalculate the profit. 

The total cost is still $160. 

The total revenue is 8 bags * $8 per bag = 8 * 8 = $64. However, this is not possible as the bags were sold at a loss. 

Let's assume the selling price is actually $12 per bag. 

The total revenue is 8 bags * $12 per bag = 8 * 12 = $96.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $96 - $160 = -$64. However, this is still a loss.

Let's assume the selling price is actually $16 per bag.

The total revenue is 8 bags * $16 per bag = 8 * 16 = $128.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $128 - $160 = -$32. However, this is still a loss.

Let's assume the selling price is actually $20 per bag.

The total revenue is 8 bags * $20 per bag = 8 * 20 = $160.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $160 - $160 = $0.

However, this is not a profit. 

Let's assume the selling price is actually $24 per bag.

The total revenue is 8 bags * $24 per bag = 8 * 24 = $192.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $192 - $160 = $32.

"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour, we need to calculate the individual rates of each person and then add them together.

Tony picks 6 quarts per hour.

Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy picks 2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky picks 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, we add the individual rates together to find the total number of quarts of strawberries that they can pick per hour: 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29.

The final answer is: 29"
"To find the number of loaves of bread left, we need to subtract the number of loaves sold and returned from the total number of loaves baked.

First, let's calculate the total number of loaves sold: 
93 (morning) + 39 (afternoon) = 132 loaves sold

Now, let's subtract the number of loaves sold and returned from the total number of loaves baked:
200 (total loaves) - 132 (loaves sold) - 6 (loaves returned) = 62

The number of loaves of bread left is 62."
"To find the number of rows of red tulips, we divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row: 36 / 6 = 6 rows.

To find the number of rows of blue tulips, we divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row: 24 / 8 = 3 rows.

Since the question asks for the total number of rows, we add the number of rows of red tulips and blue tulips: 6 + 3 = 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to first determine how many cups of raisins she has available for the oatmeal cookies. 

Since she divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, each of these will get 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins.

However, the question asks how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make, and each batch takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches she can make, we need to divide the total raisins available for oatmeal cookies by the amount needed per batch.

Since she has 9 cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies, we can calculate the number of batches as follows:

Number of batches = Total raisins available for oatmeal cookies / Raisins per batch
= 9 / (3/4)
= 9 * (4/3)
= 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we first need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device.

Before adding the new device, Ada's daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, her daily consumption is 12 * 24 = 288 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day.

After adding the new device, her daily consumption will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour. So, her daily consumption will be 14 * 24 = 336 kWh per day.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7. 

Before adding the new device, Ada's weekly consumption is 288 * 7 = 2016 kWh.
After adding the new device, her weekly consumption is 336 * 7 = 2352 kWh.

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kWh. So, the weekly cost before adding the new device is 2016 * $1.50 = $3024.
The weekly cost after adding the new device is 2352 * $1.50 = $3528.

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $3528 - $3024 = $504.

The final answer is: $504"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how long it would take one person to paint a whole house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take them twice as long to paint a whole house, which is 10 days.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can calculate the total hours it would take one person to paint a whole house as follows:

10 days * 24 hours/day = 240 hours

Now, if 5 people are painting a whole house, we can divide the total hours it would take one person to paint a whole house by 5 to find the total hours it would take 5 people to paint a whole house:

240 hours / 5 people = 48 hours

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

The final answer is: 48"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.
4. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have:
Total sofas = Ophelia's sofas + Jenna's sofas = 20 + 64 = 84
Total chairs = Ophelia's chairs + Jenna's chairs = 22 + 66 = 88

The total number of sofas and chairs is 84 + 88 = 172."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Tom spent on the headphone set. 

Let's denote the cost of the headphone set as 'x'. Since Tom paid a total of $48 for the CD and the headphone set, and the CD costs $4, we can set up the equation:

4 + x = 48

Subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation gives us:

x = 44

So, the headphone set costs $44.

Now, let's find out how many CDs Tom could have bought if he had not bought the headphone set. Since each CD costs $4, we can divide the total amount of money Tom had ($48) by the cost of one CD ($4):

48 / 4 = 12

This means Tom could have bought 12 CDs if he had not bought the headphone set.

However, we are asked to find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had not bought the headphone set. Since Tom could have bought 12 CDs without the headphone set, and he bought 1 CD with the headphone set, we subtract 1 from 12:

12 - 1 = 11

Therefore, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to consider the weeks where he spent 4 hours, 5 hours, and 6 hours. 

Let's denote the number of weeks where he spent 4 hours as 'x'. Since he spent 5 hours for two consecutive weeks, we can consider this as 2 weeks. And he spent 6 hours in one week. 

We know that the total number of weeks is 8. So, we can set up the equation: x + 2 + 1 = 8, where x is the number of weeks where he spent 4 hours.

Solving for x, we get x = 8 - 3 = 5.

Now, we can find the total number of hours spent working out. The number of hours spent in the 5 weeks where he worked out for 4 hours is 5 * 4 = 20 hours. The number of hours spent in the two weeks where he worked out for 5 hours is 2 * 5 = 10 hours. The number of hours spent in the one week where he worked out for 6 hours is 1 * 6 = 6 hours.

The total number of hours spent working out is 20 + 10 + 6 = 36 hours.

The final answer is: 36"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (which is 8) get into the bus. So, 5 * 8 = 40 people get in. Now, the total number of people on the bus is:
40 (remaining) + 40 (new passengers) = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
80 - 21 = 59

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. Since 21 got off, 3 times fewer would be 21 / 3 = 7. So, 7 passengers get in. Now, the total number of people on the bus is:
59 (remaining) + 7 (new passengers) = 66

The final number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is 66."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Jame's current age be x.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
2. The computer cost $1,100.
3. The printer cost $400 less than the computer.

First, we need to find the cost of the printer. Since the printer cost $400 less than the computer, we subtract $400 from the cost of the computer:

Printer cost = Computer cost - $400
Printer cost = $1,100 - $400
Printer cost = $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer, which is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. To find the cost of the two monitors, we subtract this amount from the total cost:

Cost of 2 monitors = Total cost - Cost of computer and printer
Cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - $1,800
Cost of 2 monitors = $600

Since there are two monitors, we need to find the cost of one monitor. We divide the cost of two monitors by 2:

Cost of one monitor = Cost of 2 monitors / 2
Cost of one monitor = $600 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $300

The final answer is: $300"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of shells brought by the boys. Since there are 10 boys (half of 20 kids) and each boy brought 60 shells, the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + 4 * 60 shells.

First, we calculate 4 times the number of shells brought by the boys: 4 * 60 = 240.

Then, we add the number of shells brought by the boys to this result: 600 + 240 = 840.

Since there are 10 girls (half of 20 kids), we need to find out how many shells each girl brought. To do this, we divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by the number of girls: 840 / 10 = 84.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of candies George had as G. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, the initial number of candies Nick had is 2G.

After George ate 5 candies, he was left with 3 candies. This means that before eating 5 candies, George had 3 + 5 = 8 candies.

Since George initially had 8 candies and Nick had twice as many, we can set up the equation: 2G = 8. Solving for G, we get G = 8 / 2 = 4.

Now that we know George initially had 4 candies, we can find out how many candies Nick had initially. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick had 2 * 4 = 8 candies.

"To find Anne's age, we first need to determine Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age as follows:

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Now that we know Alyana's age, we can find Anne's age by adding 2 years to Alyana's age:

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.

The second book is 50 mm thick.

The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so its thickness is 50 - 5 = 45 mm.

The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so its thickness is 2 * 31 = 62 mm.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together: 31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm.

The final answer is: 188"
"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we need to subtract the total number of vlogs she has already made from the target number of vlogs.

Emma made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. 

Total vlogs made = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Since Emma's target is 72 vlogs per month, we subtract the total vlogs made from the target:

72 - 54 = 18

Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month.

"To find the total amount you paid, we need to calculate the tip first. 

The tip is 20% of the dinner bill, which is $50. To find 20% of $50, we multiply $50 by 0.20 (since 20% is the same as 0.20).

Tip = $50 * 0.20 = $10

Now, we add the tip to the dinner bill to find the total amount you paid.

Total amount = Dinner bill + Tip
Total amount = $50 + $10
Total amount = $60

Since your wife wants to split the check evenly, you will pay half of the total amount.

Your share = Total amount / 2
Your share = $60 / 2
Your share = $30

The final answer is: $30"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, $18 is shared among 3 boys. This means each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy added $5 to his share, so he now has $6 + $5 = $11.

The following day, he added another $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

He then spent $8, so he has $21 - $8 = $13 left.

After saving some more, he tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8. This means he now has 3 * $13 = $39.

The final answer is: $39"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much Elvis needs to save in the first half of the month. 

Let's assume the number of days in the first half of the month is x. Then, the number of days in the second half of the month is also x (since the month has a total of 2x days). 

Let's denote the daily savings in the first half as y. Then, the total savings in the first half is xy.

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half, the daily savings in the second half is 2y.

The total savings in the second half is 2xy.

The total savings in the month is the sum of the savings in the first and second halves, which is xy + 2xy = 3xy.

We know that the total savings target is $1125, so we can set up the equation:

3xy = 1125

To find the value of xy, we divide both sides by 3:

xy = 1125 / 3
xy = 375

Now, we need to find the value of y. Since we don't know the value of x, we can express y in terms of x:

y = 375 / x

However, we know that Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half. This means that the total savings in the second half (2xy) is equal to the total savings in the first half (xy) plus the additional savings in the second half (xy). 

Since the total savings in the second half is 2xy, we can set up the equation:

2xy = xy + xy + xy
2xy = 3xy

This equation is true, but it doesn't give us any new information. We need to use the fact that the total savings in the second half is twice the daily savings in the first half. 

Let's go back to the equation xy = 375. We can express y in terms of x:

y = 375 / x

We know that the daily savings in the second half is 2y. We can substitute the expression for y:

2y = 2(375 / x)

Now, we need to find the value of x. Since the month has a total of 2x days, we can set up the equation:

x + x = 30 (assuming April has 30 days)

Combine like terms:

2x = 30

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 15

Now that we know the value of x, we can find the value of y:

y = 375 / x
y = 375 / 15
y = 25

The daily savings in the first half is $25. Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, the daily savings in the second half is 2y:

2y = 2(25)
2y = 50

The final answer is: $50"
"To find the total cost of the fruits, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of 3 apples at $1.50 each is 3 x $1.50 = $4.50.
The cost of 5 oranges at $0.80 each is 5 x $0.80 = $4.
The cost of 6 peaches at $0.75 each is 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4.50 + $4 + $4.50 = $13.

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is $20 - $13 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we need to calculate the total amount each of them will get and then find the difference.

Jairus gets $0.8 for each task, and he finished 20 tasks. So, his total earnings will be 0.8 * 20 = $16.

Jenny gets $0.5 for each task, and she also finished 20 tasks. So, her total earnings will be 0.5 * 20 = $10.

Now, to find the difference, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus's earnings: 16 - 10 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as x. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, the amount of money Jeff gets is 4x.

The total amount of money they are dividing is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Since x represents the amount of money Brad gets, and Jeff gets 4 times as much, Jeff gets 4x = 4(20) = 80 dollars.

The final answer is: $80"
"To find the total distance Jeff walks in a week, we need to calculate the total distance he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works.

Since Jeff walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back home, the total distance he walks each day is 3 + 3 = 6 miles.

If he works 5 times a week, the total distance he walks in a week is 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the process step by step.

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, which means she writes 26 letters each time. So, in this step, she writes 26 * 2 = 52 letters.

2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of the alphabet is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.

3. So, in this step, she writes 13 letters.

4. Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written. This means she re-writes 52 (from the first two steps) + 13 (from the third step) = 65 letters.

Now, to find the total number of letters Elise has written, we add the letters from each step: 52 (first two steps) + 13 (third step) + 65 (fourth step) = 130 letters.

The final answer is: 130"
"This problem can be modeled as a geometric progression. In the first round, 3 families are notified directly by Ali. In the second round, each of the 3 families notifies 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families notified. 

In the third round, each of the 9 families notifies 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families notified. 

In the fourth round, each of the 27 families notifies 3 other families, resulting in 27 * 3 = 81 new families notified.

The total number of families notified in the fourth round is 81."
"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost during the 3 months. Since he lost 10 pounds per month, the total weight lost is 10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds.

Now, we know that his final weight was 70 pounds, and he lost a total of 30 pounds. To find his initial weight, we add the weight lost to the final weight: initial weight = final weight + weight lost = 70 pounds + 30 pounds = 100 pounds.

The final answer is: 100"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Jonathan needs to have a play set five times larger than James's. Since James's play set has 80 toys, a play set five times larger would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys.

Since Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a play set five times larger than James's, let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as x. Then, the equation can be set up as x + 2 = 400.

To find the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we need to solve for x. Subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation gives us x = 400 - 2.

x = 398

"To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The cost of 5 notebooks at $1.50 each is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.
The cost of 2 pens at $0.25 each is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.
The cost of 1 calculator at $12 is $12.
The cost of 1 geometry set at $10 is $10.

The total cost of all the items before the discount is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

To apply the 10% discount, we need to find 10% of $30, which is 0.1 * $30 = $3.
The total cost after the discount is $30 - $3 = $27.

For the sales above $1000, which is $2500 - $1000 = $1500, she earns an additional 10% commission:
Commission on the sales above $1000 = 0.1 * $1500 = $150

Total commission earned by Antonella = Commission on the first $1000 + Commission on the sales above $1000
= $300 + $150

"To find out how many additional bottles Bill needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles he already has and the total number of bottles he needs.

Bill has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each, so he has a total of 2 * 24 = 48 bottles.

Since he wants 2 bottles for each of the 70 guests, he needs a total of 70 * 2 = 140 bottles.

To find out how many additional bottles he needs, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs: 140 - 48 = 92.

Therefore, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. 

Let's denote the time it takes to swim a mile in cold water as C = 16 minutes. 

The time it takes to swim a mile in warm water is 2 minutes more than twice as long as in cold water. So, the time in warm water is 2 * C + 2 = 2 * 16 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in cold and warm water.

In cold water, it takes Ray 3 * C = 3 * 16 = 48 minutes to swim 3 miles.

In warm water, it takes Ray 3 * (2 * C + 2) = 3 * (2 * 16 + 2) = 3 * 34 = 102 minutes to swim 3 miles.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee. Let's denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as 'x'. Therefore, Octavia drinks x/2 cups of coffee.

2. Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks. So, Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups of coffee.

3. Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. To find out how many cups Juan must reduce, we need to subtract the recommended amount from his current intake: 5x - 4.

However, we don't know the value of 'x', the daily recommended cups of coffee. To find the answer, we need to consider the context. Since the question asks for a numerical answer, we can assume a standard daily recommended amount of coffee, which is typically around 2 cups per day. 

Using this assumption, we can calculate the reduction in Juan's coffee intake: 5x - 4 = 5(2) - 4 = 10 - 4 = 6 cups.

Bob's weight is twice as much as Susan's, so Bob's weight = 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we need to find the average weight of the 3 friends. 
Average weight = (Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight) / 3

"To find out how many packs of candles James needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of candles required. Since each son needs candles for their birthday, we need to find the total number of candles for both sons.

The older son is 12 years old, and the younger son is 4 years younger, so the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

The number of candles needed for each son is equal to their age. Therefore, the older son needs 12 candles, and the younger son needs 8 candles.

In total, James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total number of candles needed by the number of candles in each pack: 20 / 5 = 4.

Since James needs 4 packs of candles, and each pack costs $3, the total amount James spends on candles is 4 * 3 = $12.

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Given that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes. First, let's find out how many 1.5-minute intervals are in 105 minutes. 

105 minutes / 1.5 minutes per interval = 70 intervals

Now, we can find out how many pages she read in 70 intervals. 

2 pages per interval * 70 intervals = 140 pages

So, in the first week, Judy read 140 pages. 

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week and the second week.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna. 

Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as M and the number of goals scored by Anna as A.

We are given that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, so we can write an equation: 
R = M + 20

We are also given that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, so we can write another equation: 
R = A + 45

Since we know that Richie scored 80 goals, we can substitute R = 80 into both equations:
80 = M + 20
80 = A + 45

Now, we can solve for M and A:
M = 80 - 20
M = 60
A = 80 - 45
A = 35

Now that we know the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:
Total goals = R + M + A
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate the number of wooden and plastic action figures he buys.

First, let's calculate the amount of money Peter spent on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spent an equal amount each day, we can divide the total amount of money he spent on wooden action figures by 5 (the number of days) to find the daily amount spent on wooden action figures.

Total money spent on wooden action figures = $70
Number of days spent on wooden action figures = 5
Daily amount spent on wooden action figures = Total money spent on wooden action figures / Number of days spent on wooden action figures
= $70 / 5
= $14

Since each wooden action figure costs $5, we can find the number of wooden action figures Peter bought by dividing the daily amount spent on wooden action figures by the cost of each wooden action figure.

Number of wooden action figures = Daily amount spent on wooden action figures / Cost of each wooden action figure
= $14 / $5
= 2.8 (round down to 2 since we can't buy a fraction of an action figure)

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Peter has left after buying wooden action figures.

Money left after buying wooden action figures = Total money - Total money spent on wooden action figures
= $70 - ($14 * 5)
= $70 - $70
= $0

However, since Peter has no money left, he can't buy any plastic action figures. Therefore, the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is the number of wooden action figures he bought.

Total action figures = Number of wooden action figures
= 2

The total number of roses ordered per week is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is 65 * 4 = 260 roses.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is 40 * 4 = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month: 260 - 160 = 100.

"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

Total revenue = Number of sandwiches sold * Price per sandwich
Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of bread and cheese per sandwich. 

Cost of bread per loaf = $3.00
Number of sandwiches per loaf = 10
Cost of bread per sandwich = $3.00 / 10 sandwiches = $0.30/sandwich

Cost of cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches = $30.00
Cost of cheese and condiments per sandwich = $30.00 / 10 sandwiches = $3.00/sandwich

Total cost per sandwich = Cost of bread per sandwich + Cost of cheese and condiments per sandwich
Total cost per sandwich = $0.30 + $3.00 = $3.30

Total cost for 10 sandwiches = Total cost per sandwich * Number of sandwiches
Total cost for 10 sandwiches = $3.30/sandwich * 10 sandwiches = $33.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one muffin crayon, we divide the total number of crayon pieces by 8 to find the total number of muffin crayons:

192 crayon pieces / 8 pieces/muffin crayon = 24 muffin crayons

Now, we multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price of each muffin crayon to find the total amount of money Kate can make:

24 muffin crayons * $1.50/muffin crayon = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the area of the bedroom and then calculate the cost of the new carpet, padding, and installation.

The area of the bedroom is the length multiplied by the width:
Area = length * width
Area = 18 * 12
Area = 216 square feet

The cost of the new carpet is the area multiplied by the cost per square foot:
New carpet cost = Area * $12
New carpet cost = 216 * $12
New carpet cost = $2592

The cost of the padding is the area multiplied by the cost per square foot:
Padding cost = Area * $2
Padding cost = 216 * $2
Padding cost = $432

The cost of removing the old carpet is the area multiplied by the cost per square foot:
Removal cost = Area * $4
Removal cost = 216 * $4
Removal cost = $864

The cost of installing the new carpet is the area multiplied by the cost per square foot:
Installation cost = Area * $34
Installation cost = 216 * $34
Installation cost = $7344

The total cost is the sum of the new carpet cost, padding cost, removal cost, and installation cost:
Total cost = New carpet cost + Padding cost + Removal cost + Installation cost
Total cost = $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344
Total cost = $11332

The final answer is: $11332"

"To find the total number of cards they have together, we first need to determine the number of cards each person has. 

The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards than he has, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, we add the number of cards the boy and his brother have to find the total number of cards they have together: 5 (boy's cards) + 2 (brother's cards) = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the percentage by which the oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, and then divide it by the set temperature.

The difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature is 468 - 450 = 18.

The percentage by which the oven is off is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Since the oven is off by 4% for any recipe, we need to find the temperature that is 4% less than 520 degrees.

Let's call the set temperature 'x'. We can set up the equation:

x - (4/100)x = 520

To solve for x, we can simplify the equation:

(96/100)x = 520

x = 520 * (100/96)

x = 541.67

So, Maggie should set the oven to 541.67 degrees.

The final answer is: 542"
"To find the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time as follows:
1 hour = 60 minutes
Adding the 30 minutes, we get:
60 + 30 = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting the time as follows:
2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes
Adding the 5 minutes, we get:
120 + 5 = 125 minutes

Now, we add the time of both movies together:
90 + 125 = 215 minutes

The total time Max will spend watching the two movies is 215 minutes.

215"
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's house price. 

Herb's house price = $76,000
30% of Herb's house price = 0.3 * $76,000 = $22,800
Juan's house price = Herb's house price - 30% of Herb's house price
= $76,000 - $22,800
= $53,200

Now, we need to find the combined value of the two houses.
Combined value = Herb's house price + Juan's house price
= $76,000 + $53,200
= $129,200

The final answer is: $129,200"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups Judy brought is 12, and the total number of cups her friend brought is 40. The total number of dishes Judy brought is 24, and the total number of dishes her friend brought is 44.

To find the total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by the two, we add the total number of cups and the total number of dishes: 12 + 40 + 24 + 44 = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost per pair of contacts, we first need to determine the total number of contacts in 2 boxes and the total cost of 2 boxes with the discount.

Since 90 contacts last Pete 45 days, we can find the number of contacts he uses per day: 90 contacts / 45 days = 2 contacts per day.

In 2 boxes, there are 2 * 90 = 180 contacts.

The original price of 2 boxes is 2 * $100 = $200. With a 10% discount, the discount amount is $200 * 0.10 = $20. The discounted price is $200 - $20 = $180.

Now, to find the cost per pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts: $180 / 180 contacts = $1 per contact.

Since a pair of contacts is 2 contacts, the cost per pair is $1 * 2 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate their individual earnings and then find the difference.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, for a total of 3 hours. Her hourly wage is $10, so her total earnings are 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours. His total earnings are 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

The difference in their earnings is $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total calories burned, we need to calculate the calories burned during aerobics and running separately and then add them together.

Calories burned during aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
Calories burned during running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories
Total calories burned: 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we need to find out how many sets of 200 calories are in 1600 calories.

1600 calories / 200 calories = 8

Since she needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she needs to drink 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml of water.

The final answer is: 800"
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G. 

From the given information, we have the following equations:

1. R = 0.99B (1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans)
2. G = 1.01B (1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans)
3. B + R + G = 4500 (total number of jelly beans)

Substituting the first two equations into the third equation, we get:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500
Combine like terms:
3.00B = 4500
Divide both sides by 3:
B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

To find the difference between the number of green and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to first find the third measurement. 

Jared's initial typing speed is 47 WPM. After the first increase, it becomes 52 WPM. The second increase is 5 WPM, so the third measurement will be 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, we have the three measurements: 47, 52, and 57. To find the average, we add them up and divide by 3.

Average = (47 + 52 + 57) / 3
Average = 156 / 3
Average = 52

The final answer is: 52"
"To find the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks, we need to calculate the difference in weight change between the two options.

If Martin eats Cheerios every day for breakfast, he'll lose 1.25 pounds/week. After 5 weeks, he'll lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

If he eats donuts every day for breakfast, he'll gain 1.75 pounds/week. After 5 weeks, he'll gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks is 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

"To find the total number of people attending, we need to break down the information given. 

First, Alex invites 100 people via email. Each of these people will bring 2 friends, so the total number of people invited via email is 100 + (100 * 2) = 300.

Then, Alex calls 10 friends and 8 of them will be bringing their spouses. This means 8 additional people will be attending. Since Alex's friends are already included in the count, we only need to add the spouses, so the total number of people from Alex's friends is 8.

Now, we add the people invited via email and the people from Alex's friends: 300 + 8 = 308.

However, we also need to include Alex herself, so the total number of people attending is 308 + 1 = 309.

The final answer is: 309"
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to start from the Papillon's weight and work our way back. 

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund. If we let the Dachshund's weight be D, then the Papillon's weight is D/4.

The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund's weight is 2 * 10 = 20 pounds. 

Now we can find the Papillon's weight: D/4 = 20, so D = 20 * 4 = 80 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon. If we let the Papillon's weight be P, then the Mastiff's weight is 44 * P. 

Since the Papillon's weight is 80 pounds, the Mastiff's weight is 44 * 80 = 3520 pounds.

The final answer is: 3520"
"To find the total cost of the boots on eBay, we need to add the cost of the boots and the shipping cost. The shipping cost on eBay is twice as much as on Amazon, which is $4. So, the shipping cost on eBay is 2 * $4 = $8.

The total cost of the boots on eBay is $13 (boots) + $8 (shipping) = $21.

The total cost of the boots on Amazon is $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

"To solve this problem, we can use exponential growth. The initial height of the beanstalk is 4 feet, and it doubles every day. We want to find the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to be taller than 20 feet.

Let's denote the number of days as 'n'. The height of the beanstalk after 'n' days can be represented as 4 * 2^n, since it doubles every day.

We want to find the smallest 'n' such that 4 * 2^n > 20.

We can start by trying different values of 'n':

- n = 1: 4 * 2^1 = 8 (less than 20)
- n = 2: 4 * 2^2 = 16 (less than 20)
- n = 3: 4 * 2^3 = 32 (greater than 20)

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To find the amount of protein John gets per day, we need to find the ratio of protein to the weight of mushrooms he eats. 

The ratio of protein to the weight of mushrooms is 3 grams of protein per 100 grams of mushrooms. 

To find the amount of protein per 200 grams of mushrooms, we can set up a proportion: 

(3 grams of protein / 100 grams of mushrooms) = x grams of protein / 200 grams of mushrooms

Cross-multiplying, we get: 
3 * 200 = 100 * x
600 = 100x
x = 600 / 100
x = 6 grams of protein per 200 grams of mushrooms

Now, to find the amount of protein John gets per day, we multiply the amount of protein per 200 grams of mushrooms by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):
6 grams of protein * 7 days = 42 grams of protein per week

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:

-x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1, we get:

x = 10

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. 

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

x + 3 = 10 + 3
x + 3 = 13

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how many hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. 

The base price for 2 implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. 
For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost for the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500. 

However, George has already put down a deposit of $600. So, the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour at work, we can find out how many hours he needs to work by dividing the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as x. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is 2x. The other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

One angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
The other angle is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

First, let's convert the coins to cents:
- 8 quarters = 8 * 25 = 200 cents
- 6 dimes = 6 * 10 = 60 cents
- 14 nickels = 14 * 5 = 70 cents
- 15 pennies = 15 * 1 = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has:
Total money = 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs a nickel (5 cents), we can divide the total money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many Colby can buy:
Number of gumballs = Total money / Cost per gumball = 345 / 5 = 69

"To find the rate at which the plane travels, we can use the formula:

Rate = Distance / Time

Given that the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, we can calculate the rate as follows:

Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours = 400 miles per hour

Now, to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Rate

Substituting the values, we get:

Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour = 5 hours

725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile

Since Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, the total number of rotations per month is:

362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles = 145,000 rotations/month

The total number of rotations in a year is:

145,000 rotations/month * 12 months = 1,740,000 rotations/year

To find the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced, we divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the number of rotations per year:

Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day. Since there are 1000 members, the total number of posts per day is 3 * 1000 = 3000.

Now, we multiply the total number of posts per day by the number of days in March: 3000 * 31 = 93,000.

The final numerical answer is: 93000"
"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to calculate the total amount of water used in a year and then multiply it by the cost per gallon.

Gary does laundry twice a week, so in a year (52 weeks), he does laundry 2 * 52 = 104 times.

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so the total amount of water used in a year is 104 * 20 = 2080 gallons.

The cost of water per gallon is $0.15, so the total cost of water for laundry in a year is 2080 * $0.15 = $312.

The final answer is: $312"
"To find the total amount Scarlett spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

1. The cost of the aquarium: $10.00

"To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to calculate the total amount of meat Prince sells in a day and then divide the total weight of the bull's meat by that amount.

Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, so the total amount of meat he sells in a day is:

15 kg/hour * 10 hours = 150 kg/day

Now, we need to divide the total weight of the bull's meat (750 kg) by the amount of meat Prince sells in a day (150 kg):

750 kg / 150 kg/day = 5 days

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

"To find the number of students, we first need to find the total number of seats in the auditorium. 

Total number of seats = Number of rows * Number of seats per row
Total number of seats = 4 * 18
Total number of seats = 72

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. 
Number of seats occupied by administrators = (1/4) * Total number of seats
Number of seats occupied by administrators = (1/4) * 72
Number of seats occupied by administrators = 18

Remaining seats after administrators = Total number of seats - Number of seats occupied by administrators
Remaining seats after administrators = 72 - 18
Remaining seats after administrators = 54

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. 
Number of seats occupied by parents = (1/3) * Remaining seats after administrators
Number of seats occupied by parents = (1/3) * 54
Number of seats occupied by parents = 18

Remaining seats after parents = Remaining seats after administrators - Number of seats occupied by parents
Remaining seats after parents = 54 - 18
Remaining seats after parents = 36

The rest of the seats were occupied by the students. 
Number of students = Remaining seats after parents
Number of students = 36

"To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to add the number of times each DVD has already been played to the number of times each can be played before breaking, and then add those two totals together.

DVD 1 has been played 356 times and can be played 1000 times before breaking, so it can be played 1000 - 356 = 644 more times.

DVD 2 has been played 135 times and can be played 1000 times before breaking, so it can be played 1000 - 135 = 865 more times.

Now, we add the number of times each DVD can be played before breaking to the number of times each has already been played: 356 + 644 + 135 + 865 = 2000.

"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to calculate how many pieces he uses throughout the day.

Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he spends 8 hours at school. So, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

He also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.

In total, Jim chews 4 + 2 = 6 pieces of gum during the day.

He starts with 20 pieces of gum and gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. To find out how many pieces he has left, we need to subtract the pieces he used from the total and then divide the remaining pieces by 2.

20 - 6 = 14 pieces remaining

14 / 2 = 7 pieces given to his sister

So, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to convert her speed from kb/s to Mb/s first, and then multiply it by the number of seconds in an hour.

1 Mb = 1000 kb
Ashley's speed in kb/s = 20 kb/s

To convert kb/s to Mb/s, we divide by 1000:
20 kb/s / 1000 = 0.02 Mb/s

There are 3600 seconds in an hour. To find Ashley's speed in Mb/h, we multiply her speed in Mb/s by the number of seconds in an hour:

"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to calculate the difference between the required height (4 feet) and Adam's current height (40 inches), and then divide that by his growth rate (2 inches per year).

First, let's convert the required height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 4 feet to inches as follows:

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, let's calculate the difference between the required height and Adam's current height:

48 inches (required height) - 40 inches (current height) = 8 inches

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we can divide the difference by his growth rate to find out how many years it will take for him to reach the required height:

8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To find James' earnings, we first need to calculate the profit from selling the cars. 

The cost of the cars to the company is 30% of $25,000, which is 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500 per car. 

The selling price of each car is $25,000. 

The profit per car is the selling price minus the cost, which is $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

James' commission is 10% of the total profit, which is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made $17,500."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright on the wave. This means 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders can stay upright.

Next, we are told that 60% of these 25 riders are women. To find the number of women, we multiply 25 by 0.6, which gives us 15 women.

Since the remaining riders who can stay upright are men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright. This gives us 25 - 15 = 10 men.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to find the prices of the gold and silver jewels first.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we know that the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel. 

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * $2000
Price of gold jewel = $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold jewel. 

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels.

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200
Total price = $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to determine the number of each type of stamp and add them together.

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so the number of truck stamps is 16 + 3 = 19.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so the number of rose stamps is 19 - 9 = 10.

Now, we add the number of each type of stamp together: 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the relative speed between Bob and Tom. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed to get the relative speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph
Relative speed = -15 mph

However, since we are dealing with a time problem, we need to consider the absolute value of the relative speed, which is the actual speed at which Tom is closing the gap.

Absolute relative speed = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

The distance Tom needs to cover to catch up with Bob is the initial distance between them, which is 75 miles.

Time = Distance / Absolute relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of fish Darren caught and then add 3 to it to find the number of fish Tommy caught.

First, we know that Naomi caught 17 fish. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, we can find the number of fish Darren caught by subtracting 6 from 17:

17 - 6 = 11

So, Darren caught 11 fish.

Now, we know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. To find the number of fish Tommy caught, we add 3 to the number of fish Darren caught:

11 + 3 = 14

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish.

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to determine the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as 'x'. Since there are 10 total classes, the number of classes he will attend is 10 - x.

The total cost of the classes is $60, and the cost per class is $10. We can set up the equation:

10 * (10 - x) ≤ 60

Expanding the equation, we get:

100 - 10x ≤ 60

Subtracting 100 from both sides:

-10x ≤ -40

Dividing both sides by -10 (remembering to flip the inequality sign when dividing by a negative number):

x ≥ 4

So, Manny can miss at most 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total weekly production for the two, we first need to determine their individual daily production and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day.

The total daily production for both Jewel and Julie is 50 + 100 = 150 customers per day.

To find the total weekly production, we multiply the daily production by 7: 150 * 7 = 1050.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the distance Lynn ran as 'x'. 

Since Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, Reggie's distance is x + 3.

We are also given that Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran. Paisley ran 4 miles, so Reggie's distance is 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

Now we can equate the two expressions for Reggie's distance: x + 3 = 20.

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it. Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: x = 20 - 3.

x = 17.

"To find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we need to first find the cost of one apple and one orange. 

Let's start by finding the cost of one apple. Since 4 apples cost $5.20, we can divide $5.20 by 4 to get the cost of one apple.

Cost of one apple = $5.20 / 4 = $1.30

Now, let's find the cost of one orange. Since 3 oranges cost $3.30, we can divide $3.30 by 3 to get the cost of one orange.

Cost of one orange = $3.30 / 3 = $1.10

Now that we know the cost of one apple and one orange, we can find the total cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges.

Total cost of 5 apples = 5 x $1.30 = $6.50
Total cost of 5 oranges = 5 x $1.10 = $5.50

Now, we add the total cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to get the final cost.

Total cost = $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the features and the base price:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

"To find Tim's new monthly salary, we need to calculate the 5% raise on his current salary and add it to his current salary. 

First, let's find 5% of $20,000:
5% of $20,000 = 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000

Now, let's add the 5% raise to his current salary:
New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

Next, we need to find the bonus, which is half a month's salary:
Bonus = 0.5 * $21,000 = $10,500

Now, let's find Tim's total monthly income:
Total monthly income = New monthly salary + Bonus = $21,000 + $10,500 = $31,500

To find Tim's annual income, we multiply his total monthly income by 12:
Annual income = $31,500 * 12 = $378,000

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay separately, and then add them together.

Time to dig through soil = Total depth of soil / Rate of digging through soil
Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours

Time to dig through clay = Total depth of clay / Rate of digging through clay
Since Bill digs half as fast through clay, his rate of digging through clay is 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet/hour
Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours

"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on each day and then find the difference.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got a $2 discount. So, the total cost is:
20 * 20 = $400 (initial cost)
- $2 (discount) = $398

On the second day, the price per pomegranate is $30, and there's a 10% discount on the total cost. The total cost is:
20 * 30 = $600 (initial cost)
10% of $600 = 0.1 * 600 = $60 (discount)
$600 - $60 = $540 (final cost)

Now, let's find the difference between the final prices paid on the two days:
$540 (second day) - $398 (first day) = $142

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the total sales from green hats in the first month as G. Since the sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, the sales from red hats in the first month are G/2.

We know that the total sales from red hats in the first month were $400, so we can set up the equation:

G/2 = 400

To find the value of G, we multiply both sides by 2:

G = 400 * 2
G = 800

So, the total sales from green hats in the first month were $800.

The total sales in the first month are the sum of the sales from red and green hats:

Total sales in the first month = G + G/2
= 800 + 400
= 1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month are:

Sales in the second month = (3/4) * 1200
= 900

The total sales in two months are the sum of the sales in the first and second months:

Total sales in two months = 1200 + 900

"To find out how many deviled egg halves Lori's guests will eat, we multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat. 

Number of guests: 16
Number of deviled egg halves per guest: 3

Total deviled egg halves: 16 * 3 = 48

Since Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many deviled egg halves 1 egg can make. 

1 egg makes 2 deviled egg halves.

Now, we divide the total number of deviled egg halves needed by the number of deviled egg halves 1 egg can make.

Total deviled egg halves needed: 48
Deviled egg halves per egg: 2

Number of eggs needed: 48 / 2 = 24

Since we need to find out how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12).

Number of eggs needed: 24
Number of eggs in a dozen: 12

Number of dozens of eggs needed: 24 / 12 = 2

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many pages Shiela has left to write, we need to determine the total number of pages she has already written and subtract that from the total number of pages required.

Since Shiela has finished writing 1/3 of the paper, we can calculate the number of pages she has written as follows:

Total pages required = 15
Pages written = 1/3 * Total pages required
Pages written = 1/3 * 15
Pages written = 5

Now, we subtract the number of pages written from the total number of pages required to find the number of pages left to write:

Pages left to write = Total pages required - Pages written
Pages left to write = 15 - 5
Pages left to write = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many days it will take Mike to finish reading the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read per day.

Total number of pages = 200
Pages read per day = 10

Number of days to finish reading = Total number of pages / Pages read per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we need to subtract the number of days it will take him to finish reading from the total number of days.

Days before the deadline = Total number of days - Number of days to finish reading
= 30 - 20
= 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the cost of the plane itself, the cost of renting the hanger, and the cost of fuel.

The cost of the plane is $150,000.

The cost of renting the hanger is $5000 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total cost of renting the hanger for the first year is $5000 * 12 = $60,000.

The cost of fuel is twice the cost of renting the hanger, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month. The total cost of fuel for the first year is $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

The total cost of getting and maintaining the plane for the first year is the sum of the cost of the plane, the cost of renting the hanger, and the cost of fuel: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. It took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice.
2. It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so pork took 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook.
3. Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of 80 is 40 minutes.

Now, let's add up the cooking times for all the food: 
- Rice: 30 minutes
- Pork: 50 minutes
- Beans: 40 minutes

Total cooking time = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference between them.

For the first mixture, we have 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. The cost of almonds is $10 per pound, and the cost of walnuts is $15 per pound. 

The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is (1/2) * $10 = $5.
The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is (1/3) * $15 = $5.

The total cost of the first mixture is $5 + $5 = $10.

For the second mixture, we have 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is (1/5) * $10 = $2.
The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is (1/3) * $15 = $5.

The total cost of the second mixture is $2 + $5 = $7.

Now, we need to find the difference between the costs of the two mixtures. The difference is $10 - $7 = $3.

"Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, we can set up the following equation based on the total number of legs:

4S + 2G = 70

We are also given that the total number of animal heads is 20. Since each sheep and goose has one head, we can set up another equation:

S + G = 20

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of G in both equations the same:

2S + 2G = 40

Now we can subtract this equation from the first equation to eliminate G:

(4S + 2G) - (2S + 2G) = 70 - 40
2S = 30

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

S = 15

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the cost of the donut. 

First, let's find the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. Since it costs 20% more than the normal brand, we can calculate it as follows:

Cost of normal brand = $5 per pound
Increase in cost = 20% of $5 = 0.2 * $5 = $1
Cost of more expensive brand = $5 + $1 = $6 per pound

Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee and uses 1 pound per day, he buys 7 pounds of coffee.

Cost of coffee = 7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42
Cost of donut = $2

Total cost = Cost of coffee + Cost of donut = $42 + $2 = $44

The final answer is: $44"
"To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to subtract the total cost of the items Gus bought from the total amount he spent. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought:

Adding the cost of the bucket of fried chicken: $4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00
Adding the cost of the bottle of soda: $12.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's subtract the total cost of the items from the total amount Gus spent:

Total amount spent: $20.00
Total cost of items: $13.00
Cost of the apple pie: $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The cost of the apple pie is $7.00."

"To find the total number of hours John spends in the class, we need to multiply the number of hours per class by the number of classes per week and then by the number of weeks.

Hours per class = 2
Classes per week = 4
Weeks = 6

Total hours per week = Hours per class * Classes per week
Total hours per week = 2 * 4
Total hours per week = 8

Total hours for 6 weeks = Total hours per week * Weeks
Total hours for 6 weeks = 8 * 6
Total hours for 6 weeks = 48

Now, we need to find out how many recipes John learns. He learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time.

Total hours for 6 weeks = 48

"To find the number of math teachers, we first need to find the number of history teachers and then subtract that from the total number of teachers. 

60% of 150 teachers are history teachers. To find 60% of 150, we multiply 150 by 0.6. 

150 * 0.6 = 90

So, there are 90 history teachers. To find the number of math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers.

150 - 90 = 60

There are 60 math teachers. 

Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours they sleep per day.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of money Kassidy and Rayna have. 

Since Aurelia has $120, and Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * Aurelia's money
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * 120
Kassidy's money = 90

Now, we know that Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's money as follows:
Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + 60
Rayna's money = 90 + 60
Rayna's money = 150

Now, we have the money of all three: Aurelia ($120), Kassidy ($90), and Rayna ($150). To find the total amount of money they have, we add their money together:
Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
Total money = 120 + 90 + 150
Total money = 360

If they decide to add their money together and share equally among them, we need to divide the total money by 3 (the number of people):
Shared money per person = Total money / 3
Shared money per person = 360 / 3
Shared money per person = 120

"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to first determine the total number of good days recorded by Christina. We know that she had 12 good days in the first 30 days. However, we also know that her first 8 days were good, her second 8 days were bad, and her third 8 days were neutral. This means that the good days in the first 30 days are only the first 8 days.

So, the total number of good days in the first 30 days is 8. 

Now, we are given that the next 3 days were good, neutral, and good. We need to add these 3 days to the total number of good days. 

Total good days = 8 (in the first 30 days) + 3 (in the next 3 days) = 11

However, we are asked to find the number of good days left in the month. Since we are considering the next 3 days as part of the month, we need to subtract these 3 days from the total number of good days.

Good days left in the month = Total good days - 3 = 11 - 3 = 8

Janey's books = 2x + 3

We are given that Janey has 21 books. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 3 = 21

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for 'x':

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, we need to first convert the initial height of the bamboo from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we multiply 20 feet by 12 inches/foot to get the initial height in inches.

Initial height = 20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we need to find the difference between the target height (600 inches) and the initial height (240 inches).

Height difference = 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we can find the number of days it will take to reach the target height by dividing the height difference by the daily growth rate.

Number of days = Height difference / Daily growth rate
= 360 inches / 30 inches/day
= 12 days

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so each dog has 1 toy. When there are 8 more dogs, he needs 8 more toys. Now, he has a total of 4 (initial toys) + 8 (additional toys) = 12 toys for 12 dogs.

When he comes back, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left, which means there are 2 * 8 = 16 more dogs. Since he already had 12 dogs, now he has 12 + 16 = 28 dogs. Since each dog needs 1 toy, he needs 28 toys.

However, when he comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys. Therefore, he needs 28 - 3 = 25 toys.

Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can set up a proportion to find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes.

Let's set up the proportion: 6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 6x = 96 * 36

Now, we can solve for x: 6x = 3456

Divide both sides by 6: x = 576

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cookies Max and Summer have. 

Since Katarina has 68 cookies and she has 5 less than Max, Max must have 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, but we don't know how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. However, we can express the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as x. Then, Max has x + 12 cookies.

Since we already know Max has 73 cookies, we can set up the equation x + 12 = 73. Solving for x, we get x = 73 - 12 = 61. So, the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, and we know Max has 73 cookies. Therefore, Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, we can find the total number of cookies by adding the number of cookies each person has: Katarina (68) + Max (73) + Cookie Monster (61) + Summer (96) = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298.

"To find the original length of the dress, we need to work backwards from the final length. 

Let's denote the original length of the dress as 'x'. 

When Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, the new length becomes x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

Then, she adds 20cm to the bottom of the dress, making the final length 1.5x + 20.

We are given that the final design is 140cm long, so we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

1.5x = 140 - 20
1.5x = 120

Next, divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 120 / 1.5
x = 80

The original length of the dress was 80cm.

"Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t. 

Since there is one set of twins and one set of triplets, we have two equations based on the given information:

1. T + (T + 7) + t = 44 (combined ages of the twins and the triplet)
2. T ≠ T + 7 (since the twin and the triplet are distinct individuals)

From equation 2, we can conclude that T ≠ T + 7, which means T cannot be equal to T + 7. This implies that T + 7 must be the age of the older twin.

Now, let's rewrite equation 1 as 2T + t = 44 - 7, which simplifies to 2T + t = 37.

We also know that t = T + 7 - 7, which simplifies to t = T. 

Substituting t = T into the equation 2T + t = 37, we get 2T + T = 37, which simplifies to 3T = 37.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get T = 37/3.

However, T must be an integer since age cannot be a fraction. This means that the initial assumption of t = T is incorrect.

Let's re-examine the problem. We have two equations:

1. T + (T + 7) + t = 44
2. T ≠ T + 7

From equation 2, we can conclude that T ≠ T + 7, which means T + 7 must be the age of the older twin.

Now, let's rewrite equation 1 as T + (T + 7) + t = 44, which simplifies to 2T + t = 37.

We also know that T + 7 is the age of the older twin. Let's denote the age of the older twin as T + 7 = x.

Since there is one set of twins, the age of the younger twin is T = x - 7.

Substituting T = x - 7 into the equation 2T + t = 37, we get 2(x - 7) + t = 37.

Since there is one set of triplets, the age of the triplet is t = x - 7 - 7, which simplifies to t = x - 14.

Substituting t = x - 14 into the equation 2(x - 7) + t = 37, we get 2(x - 7) + (x - 14) = 37.

Expanding the equation, we get 2x - 14 + x - 14 = 37.

Combine like terms, we get 3x - 28 = 37.

Adding 28 to both sides, we get 3x = 65.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 65/3.

However, x must be an integer since age cannot be a fraction. This means that the initial assumption of T + 7 = x is incorrect.

Let's re-examine the problem. We have two equations:

1. T + (T + 7) + t = 44

Now, let's rewrite equation 1 as T + (T + 7) + t = 44, which simplifies to 2T + t = 37.

We also know that T + 7 is the age of the older twin. Let's denote the age of the older twin as T + 7 = x.

Since there is one set of twins, the age of the younger twin is T = x - 7.

Substituting T = x - 7 into the equation 2T + t = 37, we get 2(x - 7) + t = 37.

Since there is one set of triplets, the age of the triplet is t = x - 7.

Substituting t = x - 7 into the equation 2(x - 7) + t = 37, we get 2(x - 7) + (x - 7) = 37.

Expanding the equation, we get 2x - 14 + x - 7 = 37.

Combine like terms, we get 3x - 21 = 37.

Adding 21 to both sides, we get 3x = 58.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 58/3.

However, x must be an integer since age cannot be a fraction. This means that the initial assumption of T + 7 = x is incorrect.

Let's re-examine the problem. We have two equations:

1. T + (T + 7) + t = 44

We also know that T + 7 is the age of the older twin. Let's denote the age of the older twin as T + 7 = x.

Since there is one set of twins, the age of the younger twin is T = x - 7.

Substituting T = x - 7 into the equation 2T + t = 37, we get 2(x - 7) + t = 37.

Since there is one set of triplets, the age of the triplet is t = x - 7.

Substituting t = x - 7 into the equation 2(x - 7) + t = 37, we get 2(x - 7) + (x - 7) = 37.

Expanding the equation, we get 2x - 14 + x - 7 = 37.

Combine like terms, we get 3x - 21 = 37.

Adding 21 to both sides, we get 3x = 58.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 58/3.

However, x must be an integer since age cannot be a fraction. This means that the initial assumption of T + 7 = x is incorrect.

Let's re-examine the problem. We have two equations:

1. T + (T + 7) + t = 44
2. T ≠ T + 7

From equation 2, we can conclude that T ≠ T + 7, which means T + 7 must be the age of the older twin.

"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to calculate the total time he spends on homework and subtract that from the total time he has before dinner.

First, let's convert the time before dinner from hours to minutes: 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total time John spends on homework: 
- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes
Total homework time: 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

Now, let's subtract the total homework time from the total time before dinner: 
180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to find the cost of one candy. 

Let's denote the cost of one candy as 'c'. We know that 5 lollipops and 4 candies cost $3.20. Since each lollipop costs $0.40, the cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2. 

Now, we can set up an equation to find the cost of one candy: 
5 lollipops + 4c = $3.20
$2 + 4c = $3.20

Subtract $2 from both sides of the equation:
4c = $1.20

Divide both sides by 4:
c = $0.30

Now that we know the cost of one candy, we can find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:
10 lollipops = 10 * $0.40 = $4
10 candies = 10 * $0.30 = $3

The total cost is $4 + $3 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many coins Rong and Neil save in a year and then multiply it by 10 to get the total coins saved in 10 years.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

In a year, Rong saves 20 * 12 = 240 coins.
In a year, Neil saves 28 * 12 = 336 coins.

In 10 years, Rong will save 240 * 10 = 2400 coins.
In 10 years, Neil will save 336 * 10 = 3360 coins.

The total number of coins they will have in 10 years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760.

The final answer is: 5760"
"To find the total bill, we first need to calculate the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. 

The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, but we don't know the total bill yet. Let's call the total bill 'x'. The heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100.

So, the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total amount John paid is $40 (vaccines) + $60 (heartworm check) = $100.

John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

The final answer is: $25"
"To find the price of the crate, we need to calculate the total cost of the individual fruits and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of one banana. Since one banana costs twice as much as an apple, and one apple costs $0.5, the cost of one banana is 2 * $0.5 = $1.

Next, we find the cost of one orange. Since one orange costs three times as much as a banana, and one banana costs $1, the cost of one orange is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the crate. The crate contains 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges. 

The cost of 5 bananas is 5 * $1 = $5.
The cost of 12 apples is 12 * $0.5 = $6.
The cost of 7 oranges is 7 * $3 = $21.

The total cost of the crate is $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

"To find out how many chairs Mia needs, we first need to determine the total number of chairs she has. Since there are 8 high chairs and the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, the number of regular chairs is 8 * 5 = 40.

The total number of chairs is the sum of high chairs and regular chairs, which is 8 + 40 = 48.

Since there will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending, we need to account for the babies as well. Babies will use high chairs, so we need to add 15 to the number of high chairs. The total number of people that need chairs is 42 + 15 = 57.

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs, we subtract the total number of chairs she has from the total number of people that need chairs: 57 - 48 = 9.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total points collected by Adam, Betty, Martha, and Tom, and then subtract that from the minimum threshold of 400 points.

Let's start by finding Betty's points. Since Betty collected 30% more points than Adam, we can calculate her points as follows:

Betty's points = Adam's points + (30% of Adam's points)
= 50 + (0.3 * 50)
= 50 + 15
= 65

Now, we know that Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so we can find Tom's points as follows:

Tom's points = Betty's points - 30
= 65 - 30
= 35

We are also given that Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom, so we can find Martha's points as follows:

Martha's points = 3 * Tom's points
= 3 * 35
= 105

Now, we can find the total points collected by the class as follows:

Total points = Adam's points + Betty's points + Martha's points + Tom's points
= 50 + 65 + 105 + 35
= 255

To find the points the class is missing, we subtract the total points from the minimum threshold:

Points missing = Minimum threshold - Total points
= 400 - 255
= 145

"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we first need to find the total number of fireworks set off in the city and then calculate 40% of that number. 

The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks set off in the city is 15 * 20 = 300.

Hannah will see 40% of the total number of fireworks set off in the city. To find 40% of 300, we multiply 300 by 0.4: 300 * 0.4 = 120.

Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard, so the total number of fireworks she will set off in her backyard is 3 * 5 = 15.

The total number of fireworks Hannah will see is the sum of the number of fireworks she sees from the city and the number of fireworks she sets off in her backyard: 120 + 15 = 135.

"To find the total amount spent on snacks and drinks, we first need to determine the total number of people and the total number of items (drinks and snacks) they buy.

Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people. When they meet up with 7 more friends, the total number of people becomes 13 + 7 = 20.

Each person saves a seat, so there are 20 seats. Each seat can hold 1 person, 2 drinks, and 3 snacks. Therefore, the total number of drinks and snacks is 20 * 2 (drinks) + 20 * 3 (snacks) = 40 drinks + 60 snacks = 100 items.

Since each drink and snack costs $2, the total amount spent on snacks and drinks is 100 items * $2 = $200.

"To find out how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to first determine how much Gordy's truck can carry. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds, Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

Now, we know that the combined capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds. We already know that Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds and Gordy's truck can carry 4,800 pounds. To find out how much Gary's truck can carry, we subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity of all three trucks.

Gary's truck capacity = Total capacity - (Gissela's capacity + Gordy's capacity)
Gary's truck capacity = 11,600 - (4,000 + 4,800)
Gary's truck capacity = 11,600 - 8,800
Gary's truck capacity = 2,800

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many dumplings each male ate and then add the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry.

First, let's find out how many dumplings each male ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

Since there are 6 females and each female ate 3 dumplings, the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

The total number of dumplings eaten is 32 (by males) + 18 (by females) = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the total number of dumplings eaten, which is 50.

"To find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we can first determine the amount they need to raise per hour to reach their goal. 

The amount they need to raise per hour is the total goal divided by the number of hours they have already raised money. 

Total goal = $6300
Amount raised in 3 hours = $2100

Amount raised per hour = Total goal - Amount raised in 3 hours
Amount raised per hour = $6300 - $2100
Amount raised per hour = $4200 / 3
Amount raised per hour = $1400

Now, we can find the total number of hours they need to fundraise by dividing the remaining amount they need to raise by the amount they raise per hour.

Remaining amount = Total goal - Amount raised in 3 hours
Remaining amount = $6300 - $2100
Remaining amount = $4200

Total hours = Remaining amount / Amount raised per hour
Total hours = $4200 / $1400
Total hours = 3

However, this is the number of hours they need to fundraise after the first 3 hours. To find the total number of hours, we need to add the 3 hours they have already worked.

Total hours = 3 (hours already worked) + 3 (hours needed to reach goal)

- 5 croissants at $3.00 apiece: 5 x $3.00 = $15.00
- 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each: 4 x $2.50 = $10.00
- 3 mini quiches at $4.00 apiece: 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
- 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 apiece: 13 x $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Since Marcus has a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $50.00 and subtract it from the total.

10% of $50.00 = 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many scoops Erin can buy with her $6.00. Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide the total amount of money Erin has by the cost of each scoop.

6.00 / 1.50 = 4

However, the deal is buy 2 scoops get 1 free, so Erin can buy 2 scoops for the price of 2 scoops, and get 1 free. This means she can buy 3 scoops for the price of 2 scoops.

Since Erin has $6.00, she can buy 2 sets of 2 scoops for the price of 2 scoops each, which is 4 scoops. 

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total amount of candy each person eats in two weeks and then subtract the difference from Amy's initial amount.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces, and Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces.

The difference in the amount of candy Amy has compared to Ginger is 58 - 44 = 14 pieces.

"To find the total number of tiles needed, we first need to find the area of two-thirds of the bathroom. 

The area of the entire bathroom is 36 sq ft. To find two-thirds of this area, we multiply 36 by 2/3.

36 * (2/3) = 36 * 2 / 3 = 72 / 3 = 24

So, two-thirds of the bathroom is 24 sq ft. 

Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 tiles per square foot, we multiply the area of two-thirds of the bathroom by 24.

24 * 24 = 576

The final answer is: 576"
"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the cost of picking the blueberries and compare it to the cost of buying them at the store.

The cost of picking the blueberries is the initial cost plus the cost per pound times the number of pounds picked:
Cost of picking = $20 + ($1.5 per pound * 30 pounds)
Cost of picking = $20 + $45
Cost of picking = $65

The cost of buying the blueberries at the store is the cost per pound times the number of pounds picked:
Cost at store = $2.5 per pound * 30 pounds
Cost at store = $75

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost at the store:
Savings = Cost at store - Cost of picking
Savings = $75 - $65
Savings = $10

The final answer is: $10"
"To find the total amount of money the company paid, we first need to find the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. Since the price increased by 10%, we can calculate the new price as follows:

New price = Original price + (Original price * 10%)
New price = 700 + (700 * 0.10)
New price = 700 + 70
New price = 770

Now, we can find the total amount of money the company paid by multiplying the new price by the number of computers:

Total amount = New price * Number of computers
Total amount = 770 * 500
Total amount = 385,000

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many slices were eaten by Bryce and his friends, and then subtract that from the total number of slices.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 5 people in total, including Bryce, and 2/3 of them ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we can calculate the number of slices eaten by this group. 

First, let's find out how many slices each person ate. Since each pizza has 12 slices, and 2/3 of a pizza is eaten, each person ate (2/3) * 12 = 8 slices.

Since there are 3 people in this group (Bryce and 2 friends), the total number of slices eaten by this group is 3 * 8 = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 friends, and each pizza has 12 slices, each friend ate (3/4) * 12 = 9 slices.

The total number of slices eaten by the remaining friends is 2 * 9 = 18 slices.

Now, let's add the total number of slices eaten by both groups: 24 + 18 = 42 slices.

Since there are 5 people in total, and each person ordered one pizza, the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60 slices.

Now, let's subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices: 60 - 42 = 18 slices.

"To find the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages, we need to calculate 2/3 of the time it takes the cat. 

The cat eats the sausages in 30 minutes, so the dog eats the sausages in 2/3 * 30 = 20 minutes.

Now, we need to find the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. 

Average time = (time taken by cat + time taken by dog) / 2
Average time = (30 + 20) / 2
Average time = 50 / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we multiply 8 feet by 12 and add 4 inches.

8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches
Adding 4 inches to that gives us:
96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches, and it's 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's call the length of one of Bobby's shoes ""x"". We can write an equation based on this information:

100 = 9x + 10

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 10 from both sides:

100 - 10 = 9x + 10 - 10
90 = 9x

Next, we need to get x by itself. We can do this by dividing both sides by 9:

90 / 9 = x
x = 10

"To find the total number of windows smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed from students' cars and teachers' cars separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of windows smashed from students' cars. There are 64 students' cars with 4 windows each. A quarter of the students' cars' windows are smashed, which is 1/4 * 64 = 16 cars. Since each car has 4 windows, the total number of windows smashed from students' cars is 16 * 4 = 64.

Next, let's find the number of windows smashed from teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars with 2 windows each. Three-fourths of the teachers' cars' windows are smashed, which is 3/4 * 32 = 24 cars. Since each car has 2 windows, the total number of windows smashed from teachers' cars is 24 * 2 = 48.

Now, we add the number of windows smashed from students' cars and teachers' cars to find the total number of windows smashed: 64 + 48 = 112.

6 adults will eat 1 s'more each, so 6 * 1 = 6 smores. 
Total smores needed = 18 + 6 = 24 smores.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 smores, we divide the total number of smores needed by 8 to find the number of sleeves needed. 
24 smores / 8 smores per sleeve = 3 sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we divide the number of sleeves needed by 3 to find the number of boxes needed. 
3 sleeves / 3 sleeves per box = 1 box.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the ages of Dora's father and mother.

Given that Dora is 15 years old, we can find her father's age by using the information that her father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 

Let's denote Dora's father's age as F and Dora's age as D. We have the equation: F = 2D + 8. Since Dora is 15, we can substitute D = 15 into the equation to find F.

F = 2(15) + 8
F = 30 + 8
F = 38

Now that we know Dora's father is 38 years old, we can find her mother's age. We are given that her mother is four years younger than her father. 

Let's denote her mother's age as M. We have the equation: M = F - 4. Since F = 38, we can substitute F into the equation to find M.

M = 38 - 4
M = 34

Now that we know Dora's age (15), her father's age (38), and her mother's age (34), we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.

Total combined age = D + F + M
Total combined age = 15 + 38 + 34

Candidate A got 20% of the votes, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes.

Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes, so candidate B got 20 + (50% of 20) votes. 
50% of 20 is 0.5 * 20 = 10. 
So, candidate B got 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we can calculate Beck's initial number of apples as follows:

Beck's initial apples = Boris's apples - 23
Beck's initial apples = 100 - 23
Beck's initial apples = 77

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, Beck's new number of apples is:

Beck's new apples = Beck's initial apples + 10
Beck's new apples = 77 + 10
Beck's new apples = 87

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris. Boris still has 100 apples, and Beck has 87 apples. So, the difference is:

- Students who like to play basketball = 5
- Students who like to play music = 2 * (students who like to play basketball) = 2 * 5 = 10

We know that the rest of the students like to either play video games or play music. So, the number of students who like to play video games or music is the total number of students minus the students who like to bake and basketball.

Students who like to play video games or music = Total students - Students who like to bake - Students who like to play basketball
= 50 - 10 - 5
= 35

Since the number of students who like to play music is 10, the number of students who like to play video games is the total number of students who like to play video games or music minus the number of students who like to play music.

x = 80 / 2
x = 40

Now, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. This means that 60% of the students in each class are boys. We can find the number of boys in each class by multiplying the total number of students in each class by 0.6 (which is equivalent to 60%):

Number of boys in each class = 0.6x

= 12 - 6
= 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented in a week and then multiply it by 8 (2 months * 4 weeks/month).

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented in a week:

- Weekdays: 5 days * 60 chairs/day = 300 chairs
- Weekends: 2 days * 100 chairs/day = 200 chairs
- Total chairs rented in a week: 300 + 200 = 500 chairs

Now, let's multiply the number of chairs rented in a week by 8:

500 chairs/week * 8 weeks = 4000 chairs

The final answer is: 4000"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events step by step.

Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas.

1. Arnold stole half of the bananas from the pile. Half of 48 is 48 / 2 = 24. So, after Arnold's first theft, Gunther had 48 - 24 = 24 bananas left.

2. Gunther added another 25 bananas to his pile. Now, he has 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.

3. Later that evening, Arnold stole another 12 bananas. So, after Arnold's second theft, Gunther had 49 - 12 = 37 bananas left.

4. On the third day, Gunther added another 6 bananas to his pile. Now, he has 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

Therefore, when Gunther began counting bananas on the third day, he found 43 bananas in the pile.

The final answer is: 43"
"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year, we need to first calculate the total electricity bill for a year. Since the electricity bill is $100 per month, we multiply this by 12 to get the yearly bill.

Yearly electricity bill = $100/month * 12 months/year = $1200/year

Next, we divide the yearly bill by the number of roommates to find out how much each roommate will pay.

Each roommate's share = $1200/year / 4 roommates = $300/year

The final answer is: $300"
"To find the number of glasses and plates Jeff has now, we need to subtract the number of broken items from the initial number of items.

Initially, Jeff had 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates. 

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can convert the number of dozens to the actual number of items:
- 8 dozen glasses = 8 * 12 = 96 glasses
- 4 dozen plates = 4 * 12 = 48 plates

Now, let's subtract the number of broken items:
- Broken glasses: 10
- Broken plates: 6

So, the number of glasses Jeff has now is: 96 - 10 = 86
The number of plates Jeff has now is: 48 - 6 = 42

The final number of glasses Jeff has now is 86.
The final number of plates Jeff has now is 42."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

1. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
   90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading small stickers.

2. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
   50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   Since each large sticker is worth one large button, she gets 20 large buttons from trading large stickers.

3. She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
   She had 40 large stickers initially and traded 20 for large buttons, so she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.
   Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she can trade 20 large stickers for 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.
   Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 60 small buttons from trading large stickers.

Now, let's calculate the total number of buttons she has:
- Small buttons: 27 (from small stickers) + 60 (from large stickers) = 87 small buttons
- Large buttons: 20 (from large stickers)

Total buttons = 87 (small buttons) + 20 (large buttons) = 107 buttons

"To find the total number of matches Joey played in one week, we need to add up the matches played on each day.

On Monday, Joey played 2 matches.
On Friday, Joey played 1 match.
On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 matches.

Now, let's add up the total number of matches: 2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as x. Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice as many as the votes against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

The total number of council members is 33, which is the sum of the votes in favor and against the new regulation. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 2x, we can find the number of votes in favor by multiplying x by 2:

2x = 2 * 11
2x = 22

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the total number of shirts ordered, we need to determine the number of students in each size category and add them up.

Let's start with the given information:

- 11 students need size extra-small.
- Twice as many students need size small as extra small: 2 * 11 = 22 students need size small.
- Four less than the number of size small students need size medium: 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.
- Half as many students need size large as size medium: 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.
- Six more students need size extra-large than large: 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up the number of students in each size category:
11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75

The total number of shirts ordered is 75."
"To find the amount you'll pay after the discount, we need to calculate 5% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

First, let's find 5% of $140. 
5% of $140 = (5/100) * 140 = 0.05 * 140 = $7

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:
$140 - $7 = $133

So, you'll pay $133 after the discount.

The final answer is: $133"
"To find the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last, we need to multiply the number of songs in each playlist by the number of playlists and then multiply the result by the length of each song in hours.

First, we multiply the number of songs in each playlist by the number of playlists:
300 songs/playlist * 20 playlists = 6000 songs

Then, we multiply the total number of songs by the length of each song in hours:
6000 songs * 10 hours/song = 60000 hours

The total number of hours the 20 playlists will last is 60000."

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

The remaining people are 50 - 10 = 40 people.

60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win.
60% of 40 = 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win, which is 40 - 24 = 16 people.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. 

Let's denote the total number of Pomeranians as P. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can set up the equation:

1/3 * P = 6

To solve for P, we can multiply both sides by 3:

P = 6 * 3
P = 18

So, there are 18 Pomeranians. Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let's denote the total number of puppies as J. We can set up the equation:

2/3 * J = 18

To solve for J, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

J = 18 * (3/2)
J = 27

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies. 

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much more Jayden needs to buy the camera, we first need to calculate how much money he has after receiving the money from his sister Ava.

Jayden initially had $70. Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. 

So, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115.

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera: $200 - $115 = $85.

Therefore, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.

$85"
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as x. Since the first house needs 1/2 of the second, the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house is x/2.

We are given that the third house needs double the first house, so the number of cases of shingles needed for the third house is 2 * (x/2) = x.

We know that the total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x/2 + x + x = 250

Combine like terms:

(3x)/2 = 250

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

3x = 500

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 500/3
x = 166.67

Since x represents the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house, the number of cases of shingles needed for the third house is x = 166.67.

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a case of shingles, we will round down to the nearest whole number. 

The final answer is: 167"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of each person's purchase and then add them together.

Leila buys 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so her total cost is 3 * $2 = $6.

Jack buys 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so his total cost is 5 * $1 = $5.

Chase buys 1 head of lettuce at $3, so his total cost is $3.

Now, we add the costs together: $6 (Leila) + $5 (Jack) + $3 (Chase) = $14.

"To find the number of pears George has, we need to calculate 45% of the number of bananas and add it to the number of bananas. 

First, let's find 45% of 200 bananas:
45% of 200 = 0.45 * 200 = 90

Now, let's add 90 to the number of bananas:
200 + 90 = 290

Since George has 45% more pears than bananas, the number of pears is 290.

To find the total number of fruits, we need to add the number of bananas and the number of pears:
200 (bananas) + 290 (pears) = 490

The final answer is: 490"
"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to subtract the cost of the ball from the amount of money Marissa had initially. 

Initial amount of money = $80
Cost of the ball = $20

Amount of money left = Initial amount of money - Cost of the ball
Amount of money left = $80 - $20
Amount of money left = $60

Now, we need to find out how many candy bars Marissa can buy with the remaining money. Each candy bar costs $5.

Number of candy bars = Amount of money left / Cost of each candy bar
Number of candy bars = $60 / $5
Number of candy bars = 12

"To find out how much money Sam needs to spend, we first need to determine how many kilograms of oranges are required to make 4 liters of juice. Since Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges to make 1 liter of juice, we can multiply this by 4 to find the total amount of oranges needed for 4 liters.

5 kg/orange * 4 liters/orange = 20 kg/oranges

Now, we know that each kilogram of oranges costs $3. To find the total cost, we multiply the total amount of oranges needed by the cost per kilogram.

20 kg/oranges * $3/kg/orange = $60

So, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice.

"To find out how many books Ahmed read, we need to divide the number of books Ezra read by 2, since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed. 

Ezra read 300 books, so Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Now, we need to add the 150 books Ezra decided to read to the total number of books they both read. 

Total books read by Ezra = 300 + 150 = 450 books
Total books read by Ahmed = 150 books

Total books read by both = 450 + 150 = 600 books

"To find Tanya's total earnings, we need to calculate her earnings from the hourly rate and the additional daily rate.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total earnings from the hourly rate for Monday is 5 hours * $15/hour = $75.

Additionally, she earns $5 per day for teaching more than 3 classes. Since she teaches 4 classes on Monday, she earns the additional $5. So, her total earnings for Monday is $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her total earnings from the hourly rate for Wednesday is 2 hours * $15/hour = $30.

Since she teaches less than 3 classes on Wednesday, she does not earn the additional $5 per day.

Now, we add her earnings from Monday and Wednesday to find the total earnings: $80 + $30 = $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"To find the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

The company sold 5 vanilla scents and there are 4 vanilla scents available, so the total number of vanilla scents sold is 5 * 4 = 20.

The company sold 2 fruity scents and there are 8 fruity scents available, so the total number of fruity scents sold is 2 * 8 = 16.

Now, we need to find the difference between the total number of vanilla scents sold and the total number of fruity scents sold. 

Difference = Total vanilla scents sold - Total fruity scents sold
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money Bennet will make from selling the eggplants and then determine how much he needs to make from selling the corn to reach his goal of $135.

First, let's calculate the total amount Bennet will make from selling the eggplants:

20 eggplants * $3 per eggplant = $60

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, we need to find out how much he needs to make from selling the corn:

$135 (total) - $60 (from eggplants) = $75

Now, we know that Bennet has 25 ears of corn and he needs to make $75 from selling them. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we can divide the total amount he needs to make from corn by the number of ears:

$75 ÷ 25 ears = $3 per ear

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the percentage of Tatiana's weekend spent playing soccer, we first need to determine the total time she has available and the time she spends on other activities.

Total time available = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours

Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time after reading
Remaining time after reading = 12 - 3 = 9 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours

Time spent playing soccer = Total time available - Time spent reading - Time spent playing video games
= 12 - 3 - 3
= 6 hours

To find the percentage of the weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time available and multiply by 100:
Percentage = (6 / 12) * 100
= 0.5 * 100
= 50%

"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps of the problem.

Initially, Anthony had 50 pencils.

He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon. To find out how many pencils he gave to Brandon, we multiply 50 by 1/2:
50 * (1/2) = 25 pencils given to Brandon.

Now, Anthony has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.

He gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. To find out how many pencils he gave to Charlie, we multiply 25 by 3/5:
25 * (3/5) = 15 pencils given to Charlie.

Now, Anthony has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

So, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to drive to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and he drives at 75 mph. The time it takes to drive to the museum is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time = 2 hours

Since he drives back, the total driving time is 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours.

Adding the time he spends at the museum (6 hours), the total time Jack is gone from home is:

Total time = Driving time + Time at the museum
Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time = 10 hours

"To find the total number of wheels needed for the toys, we need to calculate the number of wheels required for the cars and the motorcycles separately and then add them together.

For the cars, Henry needs 4 wheels for each of the 57 cars, so the total number of wheels needed for the cars is 4 * 57 = 228.

For the motorcycles, Henry needs 2 wheels for each of the 73 motorcycles, so the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is 2 * 73 = 146.

The total number of wheels needed for all the toys is 228 + 146 = 374.

Since Henry has a box with 650 wheels in it, we can subtract the total number of wheels needed from the total number of wheels available to find the number of wheels left.

650 - 374 = 276

The final answer is: 276"

"To find the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we need to calculate the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the remaining movies.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. A third of the movies are in series, so we can calculate this as:

600 / 3 = 200 movies in series

Since Mike can get these movies for $6 each, the total cost of the movies in series is:

200 * $6 = $1200

Next, let's find the number of older movies. 40% of the remaining movies (after removing the movies in series) are older movies. The number of remaining movies is:

600 - 200 = 400 movies

40% of 400 is:

400 * 0.4 = 160 movies

The cost of the older movies is:

160 * $5 = $800

Now, let's find the number of remaining movies that are not in series and not older movies. This is:

400 - 160 = 240 movies

The cost of these movies is:

240 * $10 = $2400

The total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection is the sum of the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the remaining movies:

"To find the distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by both driving and hiking. 

First, let's find the speed at which they hiked. They hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Their driving speed was 50 miles per hour. Half of 50 is 25, and 5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the distance they drove. They drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time, so the distance they drove is 50 * 6 = 300 miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time, so the distance they hiked is 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked. Total distance = 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

The final answer is: 330"
"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the score for each of them. Let's denote Emma's number of enemies jumped as E, Ava's number of enemies jumped as A, Emma's number of berries collected as B, Ava's number of berries collected as a, Emma's time left as T, and Ava's time left as t.

Given that Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, we have A = E + 8.

Given that Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, we have a = B + 3.

Given that Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, we have t = T - 4.

The score for each of them can be calculated as follows:
Emma's score = 10E + 5B + 30T
Ava's score = 10(A) + 5(a) + 30(t)

Substituting the given values, we get:
Emma's score = 10(E + 8) + 5(B) + 30(T)
Ava's score = 10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T - 4)

Simplifying the expressions, we get:
Emma's score = 10E + 80 + 5B + 30T
Ava's score = 10E + 80 + 5B + 150 - 30T

Now, let's find the difference between their scores:
Difference = Ava's score - Emma's score
= (10E + 80 + 5B + 150 - 30T) - (10E + 80 + 5B + 30T)
= 10E + 80 + 5B + 150 - 30T - 10E - 80 - 5B - 30T
= 150 - 30T - 30T
= 150 - 60T

However, we still need to find the value of T to calculate the difference. Since we don't have the value of T, we need to express the difference in terms of T.

But, we can simplify the expression further by factoring out -60T:
Difference = 150 - 60T

However, we can't find the difference without knowing the value of T. But, we can express the difference in terms of T."
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that are already known. Since two pizzas cost 30 dollars each, the total cost of these two pizzas is 2 * 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract the cost of these two pizzas from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the total cost of the other two pizzas. The total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars, so the total cost of the other two pizzas is 64 - 60 = 4 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can find the cost of each pizza by dividing the total cost of the other two pizzas by 2. The cost of each of the other two pizzas is 4 / 2 = 2 dollars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of times they ride their bikes on usual days and the number of times they ride on the two extra days.

On usual days, they ride thrice a day for 5 days, so the total number of times they ride on usual days is 3 * 5 = 15.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times per day. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

The total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is the sum of the times they ride on usual days and the times they ride on the extra days, which is 15 + 12 = 27.

"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as 'w' and the number of orange fish Bob bought as 'o'. 

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying 'w' white fish and 'o' orange fish, he had a total of 3 + o + 4 + w = 7 + w + o fish in the pond.

Since he had twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation: o = 2w.

We also know that the total number of fish in the pond after buying more fish is 7 + w + o. The fish he bought were 17 in total, so we can set up the equation: 7 + w + o = 17.

Substituting o = 2w into the second equation, we get: 7 + w + 2w = 17.

Combine like terms: 7 + 3w = 17.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3w = 10.

Divide both sides by 3: w = 10/3.

However, since we can't have a fraction of a fish, we need to re-examine our equations. The problem statement says that the fish he bought were 17 in total, but it doesn't specify that they were all different. It's possible that some of the fish he bought were the same color as the ones he already had.

Let's re-examine the problem. We know that the total number of fish he bought is 17, and we know that he had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish initially. We also know that after buying more fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote the number of white fish he bought as 'w' and the number of orange fish he bought as 'o'. We can set up the equation: o = 2w.

We also know that the total number of fish he bought is 17, so we can set up the equation: w + o = 17.

Substituting o = 2w into the second equation, we get: w + 2w = 17.

Combine like terms: 3w = 17.

Divide both sides by 3: w = 17/3.

However, this is still not a whole number. Let's re-examine the problem again.

We know that the total number of fish he bought is 17, and we know that he had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish initially. We also know that after buying more fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote the number of white fish he bought as 'w' and the number of orange fish he bought as 'o'. We can set up the equation: o = 2w.

We also know that the total number of fish he bought is 17, so we can set up the equation: w + o = 17.

Substituting o = 2w into the second equation, we get: w + 2w = 17.

Combine like terms: 3w = 17.

However, this is still not a whole number. Let's re-examine the problem again.

We know that the total number of fish he bought is 17, and we know that he had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish initially. We also know that after buying more fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote the number of white fish he bought as 'w' and the number of orange fish he bought as 'o'. We can set up the equation: o = 2w.

"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total amount of fuel consumed.

First, let's calculate the total distance traveled per week. Since Andy goes to work from Monday to Friday, he makes a round trip (to and from work) 5 days a week. The one-way distance is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles per day. 

The total distance traveled per week is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of fuel consumed per week. We know that Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, which means it can travel 10 miles on 1 gallon of fuel. To find out how many gallons of fuel are consumed per week, we divide the total distance traveled per week by the fuel efficiency:

50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week

Finally, we can calculate the total cost of fuel consumed per week by multiplying the amount of fuel consumed per week by the price of gas:

5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week

The final answer is: $15"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Carrie had initially and then subtract the amount she spent.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie had initially. She was given 10 twenties and 140 quarters.

The value of 10 twenties is 10 * $20 = $200.
The value of 140 quarters is 140 * $0.25 = $35.

So, the total amount of money Carrie had initially is $200 + $35 = $235.

Carrie spent all the quarters, which is $35, and 3/5 of the twenties, which is 3/5 * $200 = $120.

The total amount of money she spent is $35 + $120 = $155.

The final answer is: $155"
"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of tomatoes: 
Number of tomato plants = 5
Tomatoes per plant = 22
Total tomatoes = Number of tomato plants * Tomatoes per plant
Total tomatoes = 5 * 22
Total tomatoes = 110

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggplants:
Number of eggplant plants = 8
Eggplants per plant = 4
Total eggplants = Number of eggplant plants * Eggplants per plant
Total eggplants = 8 * 4
Total eggplants = 32

Now, let's add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:
Total fruits = Total tomatoes + Total eggplants
Total fruits = 110 + 32
Total fruits = 142

The final answer is: 142"
"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to find the total percentage of smart TVs and analog TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 = 0.25 or 25% of the total. 
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 = 0.125 or 12.5% of the total.

The total percentage of smart TVs and analog TVs sold is 25% + 12.5% = 37.5%.

Since the rest of the TVs are OLED, we subtract the total percentage of smart and analog TVs from 100% to find the percentage of OLED TVs sold: 100% - 37.5% = 62.5%.

Now, we can find the number of OLED TVs sold by multiplying the total number of TVs sold (40) by the percentage of OLED TVs sold (62.5% or 0.625): 
40 * 0.625 = 25

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to first determine how much the school will cover and then subtract the amount John has from the total cost of the trip.

The school will cover half the cost of the trip, which is $300 / 2 = $150.

The total cost of the trip is $300, and John has $50. So, the amount John is missing is $300 - $50 = $250.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out the temperature at night and then determine how many logs Carson needs to burn to raise the temperature to 32 degrees.

First, let's find the temperature at night. It's 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the day, and the day temperature is 45 degrees. 

Night temperature = Day temperature - 33
Night temperature = 45 - 33
Night temperature = 12 degrees

Since the pipes will freeze at 32 degrees, Carson needs to raise the temperature from 12 degrees to 32 degrees. 

Temperature to be raised = 32 - 12
Temperature to be raised = 20 degrees

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find the number of logs needed, we divide the temperature to be raised by the temperature each log heats up.

Number of logs = Temperature to be raised / Temperature per log
Number of logs = 20 / 5
Number of logs = 4

"To find the total number of seashells brought back, we first need to determine the number of groups formed and the number of groups that brought back seashells.

The total number of people is 90, and they are split into 9-person groups. To find the number of groups, we divide the total number of people by the number of people per group:

90 people / 9 people per group = 10 groups

Since 3/5 of the groups brought back seashells, we need to find 3/5 of the total number of groups:

3/5 * 10 groups = 6 groups

Each of these 6 groups brought back 2 seashells. To find the total number of seashells, we multiply the number of groups by the number of seashells each group brought back:

6 groups * 2 seashells per group = 12 seashells

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the number of people on the train after the two stops, we need to subtract the number of people who got off and add the number of people who got on.

Initially, there are 172 people on the train.

At the first stop, 47 people get off, so we subtract 47 from 172:
172 - 47 = 125

Then, 13 people get on, so we add 13 to 125:
125 + 13 = 138

At the next stop, 38 people get off, so we subtract 38 from 138:
138 - 38 = 100

Therefore, there are 100 people on the train.

"To find the amount Mike will have left over after paying for the jeans, we need to first calculate the discounted price of the jeans.

The original price of the jeans is $40, and they are 25% off. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (25% or 0.25).

Discount = Original Price * Discount Percentage
= $40 * 0.25
= $10

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price.

Discounted Price = Original Price - Discount
= $40 - $10
= $30

Since Mike pays with a $50 bill, we subtract the discounted price from the $50 bill to find the amount he will have left over.

Amount Left Over = $50 - $30

"To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours.

Billy's initial hourly wage is $10. After 2 months, he gets a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new hourly wage $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. After another year, he gets a raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final hourly wage $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial salary, so her hourly wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50.

Now, let's calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours:

Billy's total earnings = 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = 20 * 11.50 = $230
Sally's total earnings = 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = 20 * 10.50 = $210

"To find the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the total number of students. There are 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class, so the total number of students is:
40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students

Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by the students is:
1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees

Next, let's find the total number of teachers. There are 40 classes with an average of 3 teachers per class, so the total number of teachers is:
40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers

Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by the teachers is:
120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees

"To find the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy, we first need to find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

The total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has is the sum of the number of puppies, koalas, zebras, and frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. 

30% of 14 = 0.3 * 14 = 4.2

Since Bubbles can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy to make the percentage 30%, so we will round to the nearest whole number that will make the percentage 30% or more. 

To find the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy, we can set up the equation: 

(3 + 5 + 2 + 4 + x) / (3 + 5 + 2 + 4 + x) = 0.3

where x is the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(14 + x) / (14 + x) = 0.3

Since the denominator is the same on both sides, we can multiply both sides by (14 + x) to get:

14 + x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side of the equation, we get:

14 + x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides, we get:

14 + 0.7x = 4.2

Subtracting 14 from both sides, we get:

0.7x = -9.8

Dividing both sides by 0.7, we get:

x = -14

However, this is not a valid solution since the number of stuffed goats cannot be negative. 

Let's try a different approach. We can set up the equation:

(3 + 5 + 2 + 4 + x) / (3 + 5 + 2 + 4 + x) = 0.3

To make the percentage 30%, the numerator should be 30% of the denominator. 

Let's try to find the smallest number of stuffed goats that will make the percentage 30% or more. 

We can start by finding the smallest number of stuffed goats that will make the total number of stuffed animals a multiple of 10, since 30% of a multiple of 10 is a whole number.

The smallest multiple of 10 that is greater than 14 is 20. 

If Bubbles has 20 stuffed animals, the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy is:

20 - 14 = 6

However, this will make the percentage 40%, not 30%. 

The next multiple of 10 is 30. 

If Bubbles has 30 stuffed animals, the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy is:

30 - 14 = 16

This will make the percentage 53.33%, which is more than 30%. 

The next multiple of 10 is 40. 

If Bubbles has 40 stuffed animals, the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total hours Kris has played and subtract that from the target of 30 hours.

First, let's calculate the hours Kris played in the first 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days. If Kris plays for half an hour every day, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in the first 2 weeks.

Next, let's calculate the hours Kris played in the next week. If Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in the next week.

Now, let's add the hours Kris played in both periods: 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we subtract the total hours played from the target of 30 hours: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time.

The first car travels at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 miles/hour x 2 hours = 120 miles

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 70 miles/hour x 2 hours = 140 miles

Since the second car was initially passing the first car, we need to find the distance between them after 2 hours. The second car has traveled 20 miles further than the first car in 2 hours (140 - 120 = 20 miles). 

Therefore, the distance between the two cars after 2 hours will be 20 miles.

"To find the total cost James paid for the ring, we need to calculate the premium first and then add it to the total cost of the diamond and gold.

The total cost of the diamond and gold is $600 + $300 = $900.

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students. 

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade:
- Third grade: 340 students passed
- Fourth grade: 40 students passed
- Fifth grade: Since the pass rate for the fifth grade is twice the pass rate of the fourth grade, and the fourth grade has a pass rate of 40/100, the fifth grade's pass rate is 2 * (40/100) = 80/100. So, the number of students who passed in the fifth grade is 80/100 * 400 = 320 students.

Now, let's find the total number of students who passed:
340 (third grade) + 40 (fourth grade) + 320 (fifth grade) = 700 students

Next, let's find the total number of students:
500 (third grade) + 100 (fourth grade) + 400 (fifth grade) = 1000 students

Now, we can find the overall pass rate:
(700 students who passed / 1000 total students) * 100 = 70%

"To find the total number of glass chips Milo has, we multiply the number of chips in one bag by the number of bags he has. 

Total chips = 72 chips/bag * 2 bags = 144 chips

Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, we can find the total number of square inches Milo can make by dividing the total number of chips by 12.

Total square inches = 144 chips / 12 chips/square inch = 12 square inches

Since the mosaic is three inches tall, and we know the area (in square inches) of the mosaic, we can find the length by dividing the area by the height.

Length = Area / Height = 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches

"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount of tea each group of students drank and add them together.

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so the total amount of tea they drank is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.

16 students drank 2 quarts each, so the total amount of tea they drank is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we know that 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts. So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party in gallons is 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to first determine how many candies he has in total. 

Initially, Dale had 100 candies. He sold 150, so he was left with 100 - 150 = -50 candies. However, this is not possible since you can't have a negative number of candies. This means that Dale must have sold more candies than he initially had. 

Let's re-evaluate the situation: Dale initially had 100 candies, sold 150, and then ordered 100 more. So, he now has 100 (initial candies) + 100 (new order) = 200 candies. 

Since he sold 150 candies, he still needs to sell 200 - 150 = 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of each month and then subtract the initial number of students from it.

At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students.

- At the end of January, the number of students doubles, so there are 10 * 2 = 20 students.
- At the end of February, the number of students doubles again, so there are 20 * 2 = 40 students.
- At the end of March, the number of students doubles again, so there are 40 * 2 = 80 students.
- At the end of April, the number of students doubles again, so there are 80 * 2 = 160 students.
- At the end of May, the number of students doubles again, so there are 160 * 2 = 320 students.

Now, we need to find the number of additional students who joined by the end of May, above and beyond the initial number of students.

Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week, which has 5 days, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = 420 / 5
Average branches per day = 84

- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, we need to subtract 4 petals (1 from each set) from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many marshmallows are left after John and DeSean make their S'mores and drop some on the ground. 

First, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow and they both make 9 S'mores each, the total number of marshmallows used is 9 + 9 = 18.

However, they also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, so we need to subtract those from the total number of marshmallows used. But since we are calculating the total used, we should add the dropped marshmallows to the total used, 18 + 3 = 21.

Now, we need to subtract the total number of marshmallows used from the initial number of marshmallows in the bag. The initial number of marshmallows is 35, so the number of marshmallows left is 35 - 21 = 14.

Since there are 14 marshmallows left and there are two kids, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to find out how many each kid can have. 14 / 2 = 7.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person plays and then determine how many quarters are used.

Jack plays for 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. Since he can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, he uses 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

One of his friends is significantly worse and can play for half as long as Jack, so they play for 240 / 2 = 120 minutes. This friend uses 120 / 20 = 6 quarters.

The other two friends are significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they play for 240 * 1.5 = 360 minutes. Each of them uses 360 / 20 = 18 quarters.

Since there are two friends who play for 360 minutes, they use a total of 2 * 18 = 36 quarters.

The total number of quarters used is 12 (Jack) + 6 (worse friend) + 36 (better friends) = 54 quarters.

The cost of each quarter is $0.25, so the total amount of money used is 54 * 0.25 = $13.50.

"Let's break down the information given:

- The total amount of the scrub is 10 ounces.
- The amount of citrus zest is equal to the amount of fragrance.
- The amount of salt is equal to the amount of sugar.
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt.
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest.

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) as x. Then, the amount of salt (and sugar) is 2x, and the amount of oil is 2 * 2x = 4x.

The total amount of the scrub is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients: x (citrus zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10 ounces.

Combine like terms: 8x = 10.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 10/8 = 1.25.

Now that we know x, we can find the amount of oil: 4x = 4 * 1.25 = 5 ounces.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2: 40 * 0.2 = 8. So, Joe sells 8 cars.

3. Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

4. To find out how many cars Joe has left, we subtract the number of cars he sold and gave away from the total number of cars he had initially: 40 - 8 - 16 = 16.

"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day, and then add them together.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time in minutes, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes
4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 480 + 240 = 720 minutes.

The final answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to first determine the total number of cars in the parking lot after the first break. Initially, there were 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars after the first break is 50 + 20 = 70.

When Hunter got out of class for the lunch break, he realized that 1/2 the number of cars in the parking lot had gone. This means that 1/2 of the 70 cars left, which is 70 * 1/2 = 35 cars, had left the parking lot. 

So, the number of cars remaining in the parking lot during the lunch break is 70 - 35 = 35. However, the question asks for the total number of cars he counted during the lunch break, which is the number of cars remaining in the parking lot during the lunch break.

The total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35."
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 different tasks. So, the total number of tasks he completes in a day is:
30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day

Since each task pays $1.20, the total amount John makes in a day is:
150 tasks/day * $1.20/task = $180/day

John works a full 7-day week, so the total amount he makes in a week is:
$180/day * 7 days = $1260

The final answer is: $1260"
"To find the total points Sasha scored in both games, we need to calculate her points in each game and add them together.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game. Therefore, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored in both games, we add her points from each game: 14 + 4 = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total number of tins of cat food, we multiply the number of packages of cat food by the number of tins per package: 8 * 11 = 88.

To find the total number of tins of dog food, we multiply the number of packages of dog food by the number of tins per package: 6 * 6 = 36.

Now, we need to find the difference between the total number of tins of cat food and dog food: 88 - 36 = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation: x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341.

Combine like terms: 7x + 12 = 341.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329.

Divide both sides by 7: x = 47.

Since PJ has x cards, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has 3x cards, so Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards. Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has 3 * 47 + 12 = 147 cards.

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs and add them together.

Cindy had 5 green eggs.

She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.

She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had (1/3) * 9 = 3 yellow eggs.

To find the total number of eggs, we add the number of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and subtract the refund amount from the purchase price.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost:

Shipping cost per pound: $0.35
Number of pounds: 4
Shipping cost = 4 * $0.35 = $1.40

Shipping cost per mile: $0.08
Number of miles: 20
Shipping cost = 20 * $0.08 = $1.60

Total shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60 = $2.00

Now, let's calculate the refund amount:

Purchase price: $32
Refund percentage: 75%
Refund amount = $32 * 0.75 = $24

Now, let's calculate the total amount Milly will lose:

Total shipping cost: $2.00
Refund amount: $24
Loss = Total shipping cost - Refund amount
Loss = $2.00 - $24 = -$22.00

However, since we can't lose a negative amount of money, we need to recalculate the loss by considering the refund amount as the maximum amount Milly can get back. 

Loss = Total shipping cost - Refund amount
Loss = $2.00 - $24 = -$22.00
Since the loss can't be negative, we'll consider the refund as the maximum amount Milly can get back. 
Loss = Total shipping cost
Loss = $2.00

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she spent and subtract it from the initial amount she had, including the money her father gave her.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Mulan had initially: $40 (initial money) + $100 (money from her father) = $140.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money she spent: 2 pairs of jeans at $30 each = 2 * $30 = $60, and a bag for $20. So, the total amount spent is $60 + $20 = $80.

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $140 - $80 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then determine the production for the fourth week.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

The total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month, we can find the production for the fourth week by subtracting the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production:

50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

The final answer is: 14,000"
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on TikTok in a week and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the time she spends on TikTok in a week:

1. Time spent recording videos: 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes
2. Time spent writing songs: 2 hours = 120 minutes
3. Time spent doing makeup: 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes

Total time spent on TikTok in a week = 72 minutes + 120 minutes + 90 minutes = 282 minutes

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly time by 4:

Total time spent on TikTok in a month = 282 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = 1128 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

1128 minutes / 60 = 18.8 hours

The final answer is: 18.8"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. The cost of the initial installation is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. However, the initial installation already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier. So, we need to subtract these items from the total number of items Angela has.

Additional mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2
Additional chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1
Additional pictures: 20 - 10 = 10

The cost of the additional items is $15.00 per item. So, the total cost of the additional items is:
2 (mirrors) * $15.00 = $30.00
1 (chandelier) * $15.00 = $15.00
10 (pictures) * $15.00 = $150.00

Total cost of additional items: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

Now, we add the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items:
$129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00

The final answer is: $324.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money Anthony has saved, and then calculate 40% more than that amount.

Eva has saved $20.00. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Since Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, we need to find 40% of $30.00 and add it to $30.00. 

40% of $30.00 is 0.4 x $30.00 = $12.00. 

So, Roy has saved $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

The final answer is: $42.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the ratio of Naruto's lifting ability to Pompei's lifting ability. 

First, we know that Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay's lifting ability is 12 times that of Pompei. 

Next, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami's lifting ability is 4 * 12 = 48 times that of Pompei.

Finally, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto's lifting ability is 10 * 48 = 480 times that of Pompei.

Since Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, Naruto can lift a mountain 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). 

480 / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total distance traveled by Mason, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours, and then add them together.

Distance = Speed * Time

For the first 4 hours:
Distance = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles

For the next 6 hours:
Distance = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the time it takes for one kangaroo to travel across the highway. Since three kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, one kangaroo would take three times as long, which is 18 * 3 = 54 hours.

Now, we know that the turtles travel at half the speed of a kangaroo. If one kangaroo takes 54 hours to travel across the highway, then one turtle would take twice as long, which is 54 * 2 = 108 hours.

Since there are four turtles, and they are traveling at the same speed, we need to divide the time it takes for one turtle by the number of turtles. So, the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway is 108 / 4 = 27 hours.

The final answer is: 27"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many dishes Jada and Rory made. 

Since Kora made 20 dishes, and Rory made 20 more than Kora, Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.

Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, we need to find the total number of dishes made by all three. To do this, we add the number of dishes made by Kora, Rory, and Jada: 20 + 40 + 80 = 140.

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has after receiving her payment and her mom's contribution.

First, let's calculate the price of the new laptop after trading in her old one: 
$600 (original price) - $200 (discount) = $400

Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, so she must have $400 - $50 = $350.

She received $150 from her part-time job and $80 from her mom, so the total amount of money she received is $150 + $80 = $230.

Now, let's subtract the total amount she received from the total amount she needs to buy the laptop:
$350 (amount needed) - $230 (amount received) = $120

This means Erika already had $120 in her purse before receiving any money.

The final answer is: $120"

3 large apples can be sliced into 3 * 5 = 15 slices. 
5 small apples can be sliced into 5 * 3 = 15 slices.

The total number of slices is 15 (from large apples) + 15 (from small apples) = 30 slices.

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is 30 - 15 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to find out how many liters of milk one cow produces per day. 

Since the farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from one cow, and he has 3 cows, the total milk produced per day is 5 * 3 = 15 liters.

Now, we need to find out how many cows are needed to produce 25 liters of milk per day. We can do this by dividing the desired milk production (25 liters) by the milk production per cow (5 liters). 

25 / 5 = 5 cows.

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we need to find out how many more cows he needs to have 5 cows in total. 

5 (total cows needed) - 3 (cows already have) = 2

The farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so the number of socks Jack has is 60 / 2 = 30.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 2 * 30 = 60 socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90
Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 90 + 90 = 180."
"To find the number of students good at math, we need to consider the total number of students and the number of students good at both subjects. 

Let's denote the number of students good at both math and English as x. We know that the total number of students is 20, and the number of students good at math only is 5, and the number of students good at English only is 8.

We can set up the equation: 5 (math only) + 8 (English only) + x (both) = 20 (total)

Simplifying the equation, we get: 13 + x = 20

Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get: x = 7

This means that 7 students are good at both math and English. To find the total number of students good at math, we need to add the number of students good at math only (5) and the number of students good at both subjects (7).

Total number of students good at math = 5 (math only) + 7 (both) = 12

"To find the total time available for performances, we need to subtract the intermission time from the total concert time. 

Total concert time = 2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes
Intermission time = 10 minutes
Time available for performances = Total concert time - Intermission time = 120 - 10 = 110 minutes

Each group requires 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage. So, the total time required for each group = 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes.

Now, we can find the number of groups that can perform in the given time by dividing the time available for performances by the time required for each group.

Number of groups = Time available for performances / Time required for each group = 110 / 10 = 11

"To solve this problem, we need to understand that it's a simple interest scenario. The interest rate is 3/4 of the original amount per year, which can be expressed as 0.75x, where x is the original amount.

The formula for simple interest is: A = P(1 + rt), where A is the total amount, P is the principal (initial) amount, r is the interest rate, and t is the time in years.

In this case, P = $300, r = 0.75, and t = 3 years.

We can plug these values into the formula: A = 300(1 + 0.75*3)
A = 300(1 + 2.25)
A = 300(3.25)
A = 975

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of white shirts with no collars and the number of floral shirts with no buttons.

First, let's find the number of white shirts with collars. Since half of the white shirts have collars, we can calculate this as:

Number of white shirts with collars = Total number of white shirts / 2
= 40 / 2
= 20

Now, we can find the number of white shirts with no collars by subtracting the number of white shirts with collars from the total number of white shirts:

Number of white shirts with no collars = Total number of white shirts - Number of white shirts with collars
= 40 - 20
= 20

Next, let's find the number of floral shirts with buttons. We are given that 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.

Now, we can find the number of floral shirts with no buttons by subtracting the number of floral shirts with buttons from the total number of floral shirts:

Number of floral shirts with no buttons = Total number of floral shirts - Number of floral shirts with buttons
= 50 - 20
= 30

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars:

"Let's denote my age as 'x'. Since I am three years younger than my brother, my brother's age is x + 3. My sister is 2 years younger than me, so her age is x - 2.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, which can be expressed as 3(x + 3) - 1.

The sum of all our ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 10 + 3x - 1 = 87.

Combine the x terms: 8x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 8x = 78.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 9.75.

Since age cannot be a fraction, we need to find the closest integer that satisfies the given conditions. We can test x = 9 and x = 10.

If x = 9, then my brother's age is 9 + 3 = 12, my sister's age is 9 - 2 = 7, and my mom's age is 3(12) - 1 = 35. The sum of our ages is 9 + 12 + 7 + 35 = 63, which is less than 87.

If x = 10, then my brother's age is 10 + 3 = 13, my sister's age is 10 - 2 = 8, and my mom's age is 3(13) - 1 = 38. The sum of our ages is 10 + 13 + 8 + 38 = 69, which is still less than 87.

If x = 11, then my brother's age is 11 + 3 = 14, my sister's age is 11 - 2 = 9, and my mom's age is 3(14) - 1 = 41. The sum of our ages is 11 + 14 + 9 + 41 = 75, which is still less than 87.

If x = 12, then my brother's age is 12 + 3 = 15, my sister's age is 12 - 2 = 10, and my mom's age is 3(15) - 1 = 44. The sum of our ages is 12 + 15 + 10 + 44 = 81, which is still less than 87.

If x = 13, then my brother's age is 13 + 3 = 16, my sister's age is 13 - 2 = 11, and my mom's age is 3(16) - 1 = 47. The sum of our ages is 13 + 16 + 11 + 47 = 87.

"To find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs, we need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required and then divide that by the number of glue sticks in each pack.

Since each student needs 2 glue sticks and there are 27 students, the total number of glue sticks required is 2 * 27 = 54.

Each pack of glue sticks contains 8 sticks. To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks required by the number of glue sticks in each pack: 54 / 8 = 6.75.

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are asked to assume he will have some extra glue sticks left over, so we will round up to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at the given point over the three days.

On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point over the three days, we need to add the amounts of water passing through the river each day:

Total amount of water = 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000 gallons.

The final answer is: 24000"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. The number of people infected each day is six times the number of people infected the previous day, plus the number of people infected the previous day (since the people from the previous day are still infected).

Day 0: 10 people are infected
Day 1: 10 * 6 + 10 = 70 people are infected
Day 2: 70 * 6 + 70 = 490 people are infected
Day 3: 490 * 6 + 490 = 3130 people are infected

Therefore, after three days, 3130 people are infected.

The final answer is: 3130"
"To find the total amount of money Rafaela received, we multiply the number of customers by the tip amount each customer gave her. 

Number of customers = 40
Tip amount per customer = $20

Total money Rafaela received = Number of customers * Tip amount per customer
Total money Rafaela received = 40 * $20
Total money Rafaela received = $800

Julieta received 10% less money than Rafaela. To find 10% of the total money Rafaela received, we multiply the total money by 0.1.

10% of $800 = 0.1 * $800
10% of $800 = $80

Now, we subtract this amount from the total money Rafaela received to find the amount Julieta received.

Amount Julieta received = Total money Rafaela received - 10% of $800
Amount Julieta received = $800 - $80
Amount Julieta received = $720

To find the total amount of money both received, we add the money received by Rafaela and Julieta.

Total money received = Amount Rafaela received + Amount Julieta received
Total money received = $800 + $720
Total money received = $1520

The final answer is: $1520"
"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to calculate the total number of oranges given to her children and subtract that from the initial number of oranges she bought.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges. 

She gave her 3 daughters 2 oranges each, so the total number of oranges given to her daughters is 3 * 2 = 6 oranges.

Her only boy got 3 oranges.

The total number of oranges given to her children is 6 (daughters) + 3 (son) = 9 oranges.

To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we subtract the total number of oranges given to her children from the initial number of oranges she bought: 12 - 9 = 3 oranges.

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Claire earns 1 badge per month.
- Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.
- Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), the number of badges earned by each person is:
- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 1/2 badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:
36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total amount raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices sold and then multiply it by the price per slice.

First, let's find the total number of hours Paige baked. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours.

Since Paige can bake 2 loaves per hour, the total number of loaves baked in 5 hours is 2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is equivalent to $0.50. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the total number of slices by the price per slice: 80 slices * $0.50/slice = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we need to determine the number of silver coins first. 

Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as (x + 30). We are given that the number of gold coins is 70. 

So, we can set up the equation: x + 30 = 70.

To solve for 'x', we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation: x = 70 - 30
x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins: total_coins = 70 + 40
total_coins = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we first need to determine the total number of burritos consumed. 

There were 50 students at the picnic, and each student was given 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Mr. George also ate 20 burritos. Therefore, the total number of burritos consumed is 500 (by students) + 20 (by Mr. George) = 520.

Since there were 600 burritos ordered initially, the total number of leftover burritos is 600 - 520 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first determine the number of green and blue cars. 

Let's start with the number of green cars, which is 2 fewer than the number of red cars. Since there are 12 red cars, the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

Next, we know that the number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars. So, the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we know the total number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52.

Since the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars can be found by subtracting the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars: 75 - 52 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S.

We are given that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so we can write this as:
A = F - 12

We are also given that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so we can write this as:
S = A + 25

We are also given that together, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books, so we can write this as:
S + A + F = 85

Now, we can substitute the expressions for S and A in terms of F into the equation S + A + F = 85.

Substituting S = A + 25 and A = F - 12 into the equation S + A + F = 85, we get:
(A + 25) + (F - 12) + F = 85

Combine like terms:
A + F + 25 - 12 + F = 85
A + 2F + 13 = 85

Substitute A = F - 12 into the equation:
(F - 12) + 2F + 13 = 85

Combine like terms:
F - 12 + 2F + 13 = 85
3F + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:
3F = 84

Divide both sides by 3:
F = 28

"To find the weight of the carrots, we first need to find the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the weight of the carrots is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The weight of the carrots is 7 pounds."
"To find out how much Greg will spend on Jello, we need to calculate the total number of Jello cups he needs and then multiply it by the cost per box.

First, we need to find out how many Jello cups Greg needs in total. Since each kid will get 4 Jello cups, and there are 30 kids, the total number of Jello cups needed is 4 * 30 = 120.

Since each box of Jello makes 10 Jello cups, we need to find out how many boxes Greg needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total number of Jello cups needed by the number of Jello cups per box: 120 / 10 = 12.

Now, we know that Greg needs 12 boxes of Jello. Since each box costs $1.25, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box: 12 * $1.25 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total cost of the phones, we multiply the number of phones by the cost per phone: 5 phones * $700/phone = $3500.

"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to find out how much Keenan spends in a month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

First, let's find 40% of the total cost: 
40% of $400 = 0.4 * 400 = $160

This is the amount Keenan pays in a month. To find out how much Keenan pays per week, we need to divide the monthly amount by 4 (since there are 4 weeks in a month):
$160 / 4 = $40

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of pizza pieces eaten by Tobias, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate on each day and add them together.

On the first day, Tobias ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and divide by 5:
(2/5) * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, on the first day, Tobias ate 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. To find the remaining pieces after the first two days, we subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26

Now, we need to find 7/13 of 26:
(7/13) * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14

So, on the third day, Tobias ate 14 pieces.

To find the total number of pieces eaten, we add the pieces eaten on each day:
24 + 10 + 14 = 48

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we first need to find the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water.

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so the cost of one bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

The cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the cost of one bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, we can find the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water by multiplying the cost of one bottle of soda by 3 and the cost of one bottle of water by 2, then adding the results together.

Cost of 3 bottles of soda = 3 * $3.00 = $9.00
Cost of 2 bottles of water = 2 * $2.00 = $4.00
Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

The cost of each bolt is $0.03, and David wants to buy 16 bolts. 

Total cost = Number of bolts * Cost per bolt
Total cost = 16 * $0.03
Total cost = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount of money David has:

Initial amount = $12.48
Total cost = $0.48
Amount left = Initial amount - Total cost
Amount left = $12.48 - $0.48
Amount left = $12.00

"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours, we need to determine her hourly rate of pay. We can do this by dividing the amount she earned by the number of hours she worked.

Ella's hourly rate = Total earnings / Number of hours worked
Ella's hourly rate = $33 / 3 hours
Ella's hourly rate = $11 per hour

Now that we know her hourly rate, we can calculate her earnings for 12 hours by multiplying her hourly rate by the number of hours she will work.

Ella's earnings after 12 hours = Hourly rate * Number of hours worked
Ella's earnings after 12 hours = $11 per hour * 12 hours
Ella's earnings after 12 hours = $132

"To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Paul has 52 marbles. His friend gave him 28 marbles, so we add 28 to 52:

52 + 28 = 80

Now, Paul has 80 marbles. He lost 1/4 of his marbles. To find 1/4 of 80, we multiply 80 by 1/4 or divide 80 by 4:

80 * (1/4) = 80 / 4 = 20

So, Paul lost 20 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has left, we subtract 20 from 80:

80 - 20 = 60

Therefore, Paul has 60 marbles left.

"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points she scores from each type of question and add them together.

First, let's calculate the points from the multiple-choice questions. Amy correctly answers 80% of the 10 multiple-choice questions, so she answers 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions correctly. Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, she scores 8 points from the multiple-choice questions.

Next, let's calculate the points from the true/false questions. Amy correctly answers 90% of the 20 true/false questions, so she answers 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions correctly. Since each true/false question is worth 1 point, she scores 18 points from the true/false questions.

Finally, let's calculate the points from the long-answer questions. Amy correctly answers 60% of the 5 long-answer questions, so she answers 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions correctly. Since each long-answer question is worth 5 points, she scores 3 * 5 = 15 points from the long-answer questions.

"To find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we first need to determine how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them, we can calculate the number of chickens he plans to sell as follows:

Number of chickens to sell = 300 * (3/5)
= 300 * 0.6
= 180 chickens

Next, we know that Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000 by selling these chickens at $50 each. To find the total revenue, we multiply the number of chickens by the selling price:

Total revenue = Number of chickens to sell * Selling price
= 180 * $50
= $9000

Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, we can set up the equation:

Total revenue - Total cost = Profit
$9000 - Total cost = $2000

To find the total cost, we subtract the profit from the total revenue:

Total cost = Total revenue - Profit
= $9000 - $2000
= $7000

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for $7000.

$7000"

"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope, we need to calculate the total amount of money she gets from selling the old rope and then subtract the cost of the new rope.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Sarah gets from selling the old rope:

Length of the old rope = 20 meters
Price per meter = $2
Total amount of money = Length of the old rope * Price per meter
Total amount of money = 20 * 2
Total amount of money = $40

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new rope:

Length of the new rope = 20 meters (assuming Sarah buys the same length)
Price per meter = $1.5
Cost of the new rope = Length of the new rope * Price per meter
Cost of the new rope = 20 * 1.5
Cost of the new rope = $30

Now, let's subtract the cost of the new rope from the total amount of money Sarah gets from selling the old rope:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Melanie's current age be x. 

In 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. This means that her current age plus 10 is equal to 18. We can write this as an equation:

x + 10 = 18

To find Melanie's current age, we need to solve for x. Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us:

x = 8

So, Melanie's current age is 8 years.

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let's call this number y. We can write this as an equation:

8 + y = 3(8)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8 + y = 24

Subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation gives us:

y = 16

However, this is the number of years after her current age. To find the total number of years from now, we need to add 10 (the number of years that have already passed) to y:

y = 16 + 10
y = 26

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's find the cost of the bacon: 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total.

Next, we need to find the cost of the chicken. Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so the cost of each packet of chicken is $10 / 5 = $2. Since Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost of the chicken is 6 * $2 = $12.

The cost of the strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

The cost of the apples is 7 * ($4 / 2) = 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items: $10 (bacon) + $12 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $48.

Kelly's budget is $65, so we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $48 = $17.

"Let's denote the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts as 'x' minutes. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, its runtime is 2x minutes. 

The final concert's runtime is 65 minutes, which includes the encore. So, we can set up the equation: 2x + 15 = 65.

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 65 - 15, which simplifies to 2x = 50.

Now, divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x: x = 50 / 2, which simplifies to x = 25.

The runtime of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can set up the equation:

Speed of whatchamacallit = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
121 = 11 * Speed of thingamabob

To find the speed of the thingamabob, we divide both sides by 11:

Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which is five times the speed of the thingamabob:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55

Since Tasha made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, her total earnings from mowing lawns is 6x + 18x + 15x = 39x.

We know that Tasha made a total of $80 from both lemonade sales and mowing lawns. So, we can set up the equation 39x + y = 80, where y is the amount she made from lemonade sales.

We also know that Tasha made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, so we can substitute 6 for 6x in the equation 39x + y = 80. This gives us 6 + y = 80.

Solving for y, we get y = 74.

The final answer is: $74"
"To find Harry's weight, we need to find Christian's weight first, then subtract 5 kg from it.

Martin's weight is 55 kg. 
Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

The final answer is: 74"
"To find the total amount John earns from renting his car, we need to calculate the total hours he rents his car and multiply it by his hourly rate.

He rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so the total hours he rents his car is 10 * 3 = 30 hours.

His hourly rate is $25, so the total amount he earns is 30 * $25 = $750.

To find the profit, we need to subtract his car payment from the total amount he earns. 

Profit = Total earnings - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500
Profit = $250

The final answer is: $250"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Martha initially had some number of notebooks, let's call it x. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, Joseph had 3x notebooks.

After Martha bought 5 more notebooks, she had a total of 7 notebooks. This means that the initial number of notebooks she had (x) plus the 5 notebooks she bought equals 7. So, we can write the equation as x + 5 = 7.

To find the value of x, we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation: x = 7 - 5, which gives us x = 2.

Now that we know Martha had 2 notebooks initially, we can find out how many notebooks Joseph had. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has: 7 - 6 = 1.

"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we first need to determine the distance rowed by Anis. 

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find 1/5 of Dijana's distance, we multiply 50 by 1/5.

50 * (1/5) = 10

So, Anis rowed 10 miles more than Dijana. To find the total distance rowed by Anis, we add 10 to Dijana's distance.

Anis' distance = 50 + 10 = 60 miles

Now, we can find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis by adding their individual distances.

Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis' distance
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110 miles

The final answer is: 110"
"To find out how many cookies each of Susan's nephews will get, we first need to determine the total number of cookies available after her husband took some. 

Initially, Susan had 100 cookies. Her husband took 4 cookies, so the remaining number of cookies is 100 - 4 = 96.

Since Susan wants to divide the cookies equally among her 6 nephews, we need to divide the remaining cookies by 6. 

96 ÷ 6 = 16

So, each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more than Daniel read yesterday, which is 5 + 13 = 18 pages. 
Daniel did not read any pages today.

So, Denise's total pages read is 10 + 18 = 28 pages.
Daniel's total pages read is 13 + 0 = 13 pages.

The difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel is 28 - 13 = 15 pages.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of bowls that can be filled with the soup and then divide that by the number of child's bowls.

Since the pot can fill 4 adult's bowls or 8 child's bowls, we can assume that the capacity of the pot is equivalent to 8 child's bowls.

The family consists of 3 adults and 2 children, and each person eats one bowl at a meal. The adults will consume 3 bowls, and the children will consume 2 bowls. 

Total bowls consumed at dinner = 3 (adults) + 2 (children) = 5 bowls

Since the pot can fill 8 child's bowls, the remaining soup will be 8 - 5 = 3 bowls.

Each child will have 3 bowls of soup for lunch from the leftover soup. 

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total amount William spent, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the cost of the ballpen separately and then add them together.

The cost of 5 notebooks at $1.50 each is 5 x $1.50 = $7.50.

Now, we add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen together: $7.50 + $0.5 = $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to calculate the total amount of material required for small and large masks separately and then add them together.

For small masks, Jo needs 2 yards of material for each 4 masks. So, the amount of material needed for 20 small masks is:
20 small masks / 4 small masks per 2 yards = 5 sets of 4 small masks
Since each set requires 2 yards, the total material needed for small masks is 5 sets * 2 yards/set = 10 yards

For large masks, Jo needs 2.25 yards of material for each 3 masks. So, the amount of material needed for 8 large masks is:
8 large masks / 3 large masks per 2.25 yards = 2.67 sets of 3 large masks (approximately)
Since each set requires 2.25 yards, the total material needed for large masks is 2.67 sets * 2.25 yards/set ≈ 6 yards

Now, we add the material needed for small and large masks together:
Total material needed = material for small masks + material for large masks
Total material needed = 10 yards + 6 yards
Total material needed = 16 yards

"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to first find the total number of tickets she bought and the total amount she spent.

Deepa saw each of the 9 movies 3 times, so the total number of tickets she bought is 9 * 3 = 27.

The total amount she spent is given as $216.

To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets: 

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
= $216 / 27
= $8

"To find Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total time he spends on activities and subtract that from the total hours in a day (24 hours).

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night. 
He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours a day.
He walks his dog for 1 hour a day.

Total time spent on activities = 10 (sleep) + 8 (work) + 1 (walk) = 19 hours

Free time = Total hours in a day - Total time spent on activities
Free time = 24 - 19
Free time = 5 hours

"To find out how many red shoeboxes Tim used, we need to calculate 1/3 of 9. 

1/3 of 9 is 9 / 3 = 3.

So, Tim used 3 red shoeboxes. 

Now, we know Tim used 3 blue shoeboxes and 3 red shoeboxes. 

Initially, Tim had 7 blue shoeboxes and 9 red shoeboxes. 

After using 3 blue shoeboxes, he has 7 - 3 = 4 blue shoeboxes left.

After using 3 red shoeboxes, he has 9 - 3 = 6 red shoeboxes left.

So, Tim has 4 blue shoeboxes and 6 red shoeboxes left.

Joseph currently has 18 - 2 = 16 books.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to first calculate how many marbles he gave away. 

Dean gives 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie. Since he has 30 marbles, we can calculate 1/5 of 30 as follows: 
1/5 * 30 = 30 / 5 = 6

So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie. 

Then, he gives 10 marbles to Donald. 

In total, Dean gives away 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we subtract the marbles he gave away from the total number of marbles he had: 
30 - 16 = 14

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.

The final answer is: 14"
"Let's denote Duncan's age eight years ago as D - 8 and Adam's age four years ago as A - 4. According to the problem, D - 8 = 2(A - 4). 

Since Duncan's age is 60 now, we can substitute D = 60 into the equation: 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4). 

Simplifying the equation, we get 52 = 2(A - 4). 

Divide both sides by 2 to isolate A - 4: 26 = A - 4.

Add 4 to both sides to solve for A: A = 30.

Now, we need to find Adam's age in 8 years. Since Adam is 30 now, we add 8 to his current age: 30 + 8 = 38.

"To find the total number of acres of Farmer Smith's farm, we need to calculate twice the number of acres of Farmer Brown's farm and then add 100 to it.

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. Twice that would be 2 * 200 = 400 acres. 

Adding 100 acres to that gives us 400 + 100 = 500 acres for Farmer Smith's farm.

Now, to find the total number of acres of both farms, we add the acres of Farmer Brown's farm to the acres of Farmer Smith's farm: 200 + 500 = 700 acres.

The final answer is: 700"
"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to calculate the total number of packages he completes in that time and then multiply it by his hourly wage.

First, let's find out how many packages Colby completes in an hour. He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so we can write this as:

Packages per hour = 50 - 10
Packages per hour = 40

Now, let's calculate the total number of packages Colby completes in an 8-hour workday:

Total packages per day = Packages per hour * 8
Total packages per day = 40 * 8
Total packages per day = 320

Now, let's calculate Colby's daily earnings by multiplying the total number of packages he completes by his hourly wage:

Daily earnings = Total packages per day * Hourly wage
Daily earnings = 320 * $0.20
Daily earnings = $64

The final answer is: $64"
"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the time it takes to solve the extreme sudoku and then divide it by the time it takes to drink one bottle of water.

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so the time to solve an extreme sudoku is 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to convert the time to solve the extreme sudoku to hours and then divide by 0.5 (since there are 2 half hours in an hour). 

180 minutes is equal to 3 hours (180 / 60 = 3). 

Now, we divide 3 hours by 0.5 to get the number of half hours, which is 6. 

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, he drinks 6 bottles of water in 3 hours.

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as y. Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces at each yellow balloon, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40, and the total number of bologna pieces thrown at yellow balloons is 3y.

We know that the total number of bologna pieces thrown is 58, so we can set up the equation: 40 + 3y = 58.

To solve for y, we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation: 3y = 58 - 40, which simplifies to 3y = 18.

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 3 to isolate y: y = 18 / 3, which simplifies to y = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in 30 days and then divide that by the interval at which he needs a tune-up.

"To find the total hours Bruce works, we need to calculate the hours he works each day and add them up.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours he works each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of money Julia and Nadine had, and then divide it by 2 to find out how much each of them received as allowance.

First, let's calculate the cost of the balloons. 1 dozen balloons is equal to 12 balloons. Since 2 balloons cost $0.5, we can find the cost of 1 balloon by dividing $0.5 by 2, which is $0.25. Now, we can find the cost of 12 balloons by multiplying the cost of 1 balloon by 12, which is $0.25 * 12 = $3.

The total cost of the cake and the balloons is $11 + $3 = $14. The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is $7 * 2 = $14. Since the total cost of the cake, balloons, and ice cream is $14, the remaining money was also $14.

Since the remaining money was used to buy the ice cream, the total amount of money Julia and Nadine had is the cost of the cake, balloons, and ice cream, which is $14 + $14 = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount of money by 2 to find out how much each of them received. $28 / 2 = $14.

"To find the total profit made by the class, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's find the total revenue. Each student sold 10 lollipops at $0.8 each, so the total revenue per student is 10 * $0.8 = $8. 

Since there are 30 students, the total revenue is 30 * $8 = $240.

Next, let's find the total cost. The class bought the lollipops for $0.5 each, and each student sold 10 lollipops. So, the total number of lollipops bought is 30 * 10 = 300.

The total cost is 300 * $0.5 = $150.

Now, we can find the total profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $240 - $150 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and add them up.

Larry has 3 cats.

He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

To find the total number of pets, we add up the number of each type of pet: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

Together, they eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices a day.

To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat per day: 24 / 6 = 4.

The loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"To find the number of shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the total number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and we want to know the total by her 10th birthday, we need to consider the months from her 5th birthday to her 10th birthday.

There are 12 months in a year. From her 5th birthday to her 10th birthday, Martha has been collecting shells for 5 years. 

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she has collected is equal to the total number of months she has been collecting shells.

Total shells collected = 60

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cups of tea are in each row. Since Lana divides the 27 cups into 3 rows, we can divide 27 by 3 to get the number of cups in each row.

27 cups / 3 rows = 9 cups per row

Since Lana creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row is also 9.

Now, let's find out how many cups of tea are used for chamomile and mint tea in total. Since there are 3 rows, and each row has 9 cups of mint tea, the total number of mint tea cups is:

9 cups/row * 3 rows = 27 cups

However, we know that Lana uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. This means that the total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea is 27 + 15 = 42 cups.

Since we already know that the total number of mint tea cups is 27, we can set up an equation to find the number of chamomile tea cups:

Chamomile tea cups + Mint tea cups = Total tea cups
Let's denote the number of chamomile tea cups as x. Then, we have:
x + 27 = 42

Solving for x, we get:
x = 42 - 27
x = 15

So, the number of chamomile tea cups is 15. Since there are 3 rows, and each row has equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups, the number of mint tea cups in each row is still 9.

However, we need to verify if this is correct. If there are 15 chamomile tea cups in total, and 3 rows, then the number of chamomile tea cups in each row is 15 / 3 = 5. Since there are equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row is also 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip. 

Let's denote the number of berries the sloth picks up per trip as 'b'. Since the sloth takes 4 hours to make a round trip, in 8 hours, he can make 8/4 = 2 trips. 

Since the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, and he makes 2 trips, the total number of berries he picks up in 8 hours is 2b. 

We can set up the equation 2b = 24 to find the minimum number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip.

2b = 24
b = 24 / 2
b = 12

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much water is initially filled in the tank and then subtract the amount of water used over 6 days.

First, Anthony and his father fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool. Since there are 10000 gallons of water in the pool, half of that is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. To find out how much water will be remaining in the tank after 6 days, we need to multiply the rate of water usage by the number of days: 500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons.

Now, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount in the tank: 5000 gallons - 3000 gallons = 2000 gallons.

"To find the total calories of the pastries, we first need to find the calories of a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin. 

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 * (1/3) = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 * (1/3) = 150 calories.

Now, we can find the total calories of the mini cinnamon rolls: 200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories = 40,000 calories.

Next, we can find the total calories of the mini blueberry muffins: 300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories = 45,000 calories.

Finally, we can find the total calories of all the pastries: 40,000 calories + 45,000 calories = 85,000 calories.

"Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as p, and John's age as j. 

We are given that Paul is 10 years older than John, so p = j + 10.

We are also given that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, so P = p + j.

We are also given that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years old, so P + p + j = 100.

Substituting p = j + 10 into the equation P = p + j, we get P = (j + 10) + j, which simplifies to P = 2j + 10.

Substituting P = 2j + 10 and p = j + 10 into the equation P + p + j = 100, we get (2j + 10) + (j + 10) + j = 100.

Combine like terms to get 4j + 20 = 100.

Subtract 20 from both sides to get 4j = 80.

Divide both sides by 4 to get j = 20.

Now that we know j = 20, we can find p by substituting j into the equation p = j + 10, which gives p = 20 + 10 = 30.

Now that we know p = 30, we can find P by substituting p into the equation P = p + j, which gives P = 30 + 20 = 50.

Sydney spits 35 seeds, each 12 feet, so the total distance spat by Sydney is 35 * 12 = 420 feet.

The total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney is 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

They spat a total of 40 + 35 = 75 seeds.

The average total distance spat is 820 / 75 = 10.93 (rounded to two decimal places).

The final answer is: 10.93"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month and then find the difference in their total revenue.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month:

Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets
WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from each machine:

Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

Now, let's find the difference in their total revenue:

$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

The final answer is: $64,800"
"To find out how much Cameron would save, we first need to calculate the cost of his stay with the 24-hour option and the cost of his stay with the 12-hour option plus the additional hours.

Cameron stays from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. 

The 24-hour option would cost 1600 pesos.

For the 12-hour option, Cameron pays 1000 pesos for the initial 12 hours. Then, he pays 70 pesos for every additional hour. Since he stays for 5 more hours (17 - 12 = 5), he pays 5 * 70 = 350 pesos for the additional hours. So, the total cost for the 12-hour option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of the 12-hour option from the cost of the 24-hour option: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final answer is: $250"
"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to determine the amount each sheep needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Each goat needs 5 pounds, so twice that amount is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds. Three pounds less than that is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately:

For the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds
For the sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

To find the total amount of hay needed, we add the amount needed for the goats and the sheep:

75 pounds (goats) + 84 pounds (sheep) = 159 pounds

The final answer is: 159"
"To find out how much money John has left after buying gas and depositing money in the bank, we first need to calculate his total earnings for the week. 

John's total earnings = 50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars.

After spending 50 dollars on gas, he has:
300 - 50 = 250 dollars.

He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he will be left with:
250 - 100 = 150 dollars.

Now, let's calculate how much he spends on pencils:
5 pencils * 10 dollars/pencil = 50 dollars.

After buying pencils, he has:
150 - 50 = 100 dollars.

Now, let's find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy:
100 / 25 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of letters Craig spelled and the total number of letters his brother spelled. 

Craig spelled 20 words with 15 letters each, so the total number of letters he spelled is 20 * 15 = 300.

Since Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, the total number of letters his brother spelled is 300 + 50 = 350.

The total number of letters they've spelled is the sum of the letters Craig and his brother spelled, which is 300 + 350 = 650.

The final numerical answer is: 650"
"To find the total number of children in the drill, we need to multiply the number of children in each row by the number of rows and then multiply the result by the number of schools.

Number of children in each row = 8
Number of rows = 7

"To find the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, we first need to determine the total number of bottles she gives to the students. 

Since there are 29 pupils and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice, the total number of bottles given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58.

The teacher has 9 coupons, each redeemable for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles she can get is 9 * 100 = 900.

To find the number of bottles left for herself, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles she can get: 900 - 58 = 842.

The final answer is: 842"
"To find the total amount Patty charged, we need to calculate the labor cost and add it to the cost of parts and the initial visit fee.

The labor cost is $35 per hour, and the job took 2.25 hours. Since the labor is charged per hour or part thereof, we need to round up to the nearest hour for the labor cost. However, in this case, we can simply multiply the labor rate by the number of hours worked, which is 2.25.

Labor cost = $35 * 2.25 = $78.75

The cost of parts is $60.

The initial visit fee is $40.

Total cost = Labor cost + Cost of parts + Initial visit fee
Total cost = $78.75 + $60 + $40
Total cost = $178.75

The final answer is: $178.75"
"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we first need to calculate the original price of the CDs and then subtract the discount. 

The original price of 10 CDs is 10 * $15 = $150.

Since James gets a 40% discount, we need to find 40% of $150. 
40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the price James paid: 
$150 - $60 = $90.

James decides to sell 5 CDs for $40 each. 
The total amount he gets from selling the CDs is 5 * $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he got from selling the CDs from the price he paid for the CDs: 
$90 - $200 = -$110.

However, since James can't be out a negative amount of money, this means he actually lost money. The correct interpretation is that he is out $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"To find the total amount Jen will earn, we need to calculate the total revenue from each type of root crop and then add them together.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the time it took James to swim 60% of the distance. 

Distance = 20 miles
Speed = 2 miles per hour
Time = Distance / Speed = 20 / 2 = 10 hours

60% of the distance is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. 
Time taken to swim 12 miles = 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

Since he rests for half as long as the swimming time, he rests for 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, the remaining distance is 20 - 12 = 8 miles. 
He swims at half the speed, so his new speed is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour.
Time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles = 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

Total time taken = Time taken to swim 12 miles + Time taken to rest + Time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles
Total time taken = 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

"To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday and then subtract 40 from that result.

Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves as Sam had, so we subtract 40 from 490: 490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

The final answer is: 450"
"To find the total number of stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to subtract the stickers she lost from the stickers she initially received, and then add the stickers she received for helping her classmates.

Jasmine initially received 15 stickers. 
She lost 7 stickers, so we subtract 7 from 15: 15 - 7 = 8.
Then, she received 5 more stickers for helping her classmates. 
We add 5 to 8: 8 + 5 = 13.

- Commission rate: 10%
- Commission per copy: 10% of $5 = 0.1 * $5 = $0.5
- Total commission from New York Times: 6 * $0.5 = $3

Commission from Wall Street Journal:
- Number of copies sold: 10
- Price per copy: $15
- Commission rate: 8%
- Commission per copy: 8% of $15 = 0.08 * $15 = $1.2

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Deanna is 26 years old.
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old.
3. Marcus is half of Leo's age, so Leo's age is twice Marcus's age. 

To find Leo's age, we multiply Marcus's age by 2: 21 * 2 = 42.

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Bahati and Dinar. 

Let's denote the points scored by Dinar as x. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati's points can be represented as x + 10. 

We also know that Azibo scored 20 more points than Bahati, so Azibo's points can be represented as (x + 10) + 20 = x + 30.

The total points scored by the team is 45, which is the sum of the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x + 30) = 45

Combine like terms:
3x + 40 = 45

Subtract 40 from both sides:
3x = 5

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 5/3

However, x represents the points scored by Dinar, which cannot be a fraction. This indicates that the initial assumption of x being the points scored by Dinar is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Let's denote the points scored by Dinar as x. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so Bahati's points can be represented as x + 10. Azibo scored 20 more points than Bahati, so Azibo's points can be represented as (x + 10) + 20 = x + 30.

The total points scored by the team is 45, which is the sum of the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x + 30) = 45

Combine like terms:
3x + 40 = 45

Subtract 40 from both sides:
3x = 5

Since 3x = 5 is not possible, the initial assumption of x being the points scored by Dinar is incorrect. However, we can re-evaluate the problem by assuming x is the points scored by Dinar, but x must be an integer.

Let's re-evaluate the problem with x being an integer.

x + (x + 10) + (x + 30) = 45

Combine like terms:
3x + 40 = 45

Subtract 40 from both sides:
3x = 5

"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book in inches.

Since each paper is 100 pages to the inch and each paper is printed on both sides, we have 200 pages per inch (100 pages per side).

Given that the book is 1.5 inches thick, we can multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book:

200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 300 pages

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total time he spent stapling reports and then multiply it by the rate at which he staples reports.

First, let's find the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He stapled from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 15 hours by 60 minutes to get the total minutes:
15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we know that Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find the total number of reports he stapled, we need to multiply the total minutes by the rate at which he staples reports and then divide by the time it takes him to staple 30 reports.

First, let's find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
900 minutes / 15 minutes = 60 intervals

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we multiply the number of intervals by 30:
60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find the total minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. This is a total of 8 hours, which is equivalent to 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m. This means she slept from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m., which is a total of 7 hours and 55 minutes. 

To convert this to minutes, we multiply 7 hours by 60 and add 55 minutes: 7 * 60 = 420 minutes + 55 minutes = 475 minutes.

Now, we need to subtract the time she was sleepwalking, which was from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. This is a total of 23 minutes.

So, the total minutes she slept on her bed is 475 - 23 = 452 minutes.

The final answer is: 452"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. 

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

Number of measuring cups = 2 dozen = 2 * 12 = 24
Number of measuring spoons = 2/3 * 24 = 16

Now, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so we subtract 6 from the initial number of measuring spoons:

Remaining measuring spoons = 16 - 6 = 10

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the remaining measuring spoons and the measuring cups:

Total remaining utensils = 10 (measuring spoons) + 24 (measuring cups) = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we first need to find the number of occupied beds and then subtract it from the total capacity.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied. 

1/5 of 1000 is 100, so 100 beds are occupied initially.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we need to find the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 14 days.

In 14 days, 50 patients are admitted each day, so the total number of patients admitted is 50 * 14 = 700.

Now, we add the initial occupied beds to the total number of patients admitted: 100 + 700 = 800.

The total number of occupied beds is 800, so the number of unoccupied beds is 1000 - 800 = 200.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we first need to determine the number of non-work emails she sends. 

She sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to family. Two-thirds of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6. This means she sends 6 emails to her family.

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after sending emails to family. Since she sends 6 emails to family, the remaining emails are 9 - 6 = 3.

One-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend. One-third of 3 is (1/3) * 3 = 1.

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna.
2. Shawna is three times as old as Aliya.
3. Aliya is 3 years old.

From point 2, we can express Shawna's age in terms of Aliya's age: Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age = 3 * 3 = 9 years.

From point 1, we can express Shawna's father's age in terms of Shawna's age: Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age = 5 * 9 = 45 years.

"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number reported by Courtney and subtract it from her total.

Let's denote the actual number of people as x. Since Courtney overstated the number by 20%, we can set up the equation:

48 = x + 0.20x

Combine like terms:

48 = 1.20x

Now, divide both sides by 1.20 to solve for x:

x = 48 / 1.20
x = 40

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that Jason carried 2 balls, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. This means Jeffrey carried half the number of balls that Jason carried, which is 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them: 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

However, this is the number of balls carried by the boys, not the total number of balls the coach brought to practice. Since the boys picked up and carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is equal to the number of balls the boys carried.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of holes dug on the first day as H1 = 10, on the second day as H2 = 13, and on the third day as H3 = 8.

The total number of holes at the end of the third day is the sum of the holes dug on the first three days minus the two holes filled in: H_total_3 = H1 + H2 + H3 - 2 = 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29.

The problem states that the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. This means the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 times the number of holes at the end of the first day: H_total_4 = 4 * H1 = 4 * 10 = 40.

Since the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is the sum of the holes dug on the first four days minus the two holes filled in on the third day, we can set up the equation: H_total_4 = H1 + H2 + H3 + H4 - 2.

We know H_total_4 = 40, H1 = 10, H2 = 13, and H3 = 8. We can plug these values into the equation and solve for H4: 40 = 10 + 13 + 8 + H4 - 2.

Combine the constants: 40 = 31 + H4.

Subtract 31 from both sides: H4 = 9.

However, this is the total number of holes dug on the fourth day, including the treasure chest. Since the problem asks for the number of holes dug before finding the treasure, we need to subtract 1 (the hole with the treasure chest): H4_before_treasure = H4 - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's denote the number of corn chips that Amora and Lainey got as x. Since Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others, Collins got x + 15 corn chips.

We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, so we can set up the equation:

x = 70

Since Collins got x + 15 corn chips, we can set up the equation:

x + 15 = 70 + 15 (since Collins got 15 more than the others)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 15 = 85

Subtracting 15 from both sides, we get:

x = 70

This confirms that Amora and Lainey indeed got 70 corn chips each.

Now, let's find the total number of corn chips. We know that Collins got x + 15 corn chips, which is 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips that Amora, Lainey, and Collins got:

Total = x + x + (x + 15)
Total = 2x + (x + 15)
Total = 3x + 15
Total = 3(70) + 15
Total = 210 + 15
Total = 225

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the cost of travel, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of supplies. 

First, let's find 50% of the cost of supplies. 50% of $400 is 0.5 * 400 = $200.

Now, we add this to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel. 
Cost of travel = Cost of supplies + 50% of cost of supplies
Cost of travel = $400 + $200
Cost of travel = $600

The final answer is: $600"
"Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as L. We are given the following information:

1. L = S + 5
2. S = 4A - 13
3. A + S + L = 339

We can substitute the first equation into the third equation to get:
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
Combine like terms:
2S + A + 5 = 339

Now, substitute the second equation into the above equation:
2(4A - 13) + A + 5 = 339
Expand the equation:
8A - 26 + A + 5 = 339
Combine like terms:
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide both sides by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

"To find the total number of episodes, we need to find half of the number of minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, there are 20 minutes per episode. Half of 20 is 10. 

So, there are 10 episodes in total. 

To find the total time spent watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode: 10 episodes * 20 minutes per episode = 200 minutes.

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and then add it to the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the southerly direction for the first 10 hours:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours
Distance = 300 miles

Then, the bird flies towards the north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 36 miles

Since the bird is flying north, this distance is subtracted from the total southerly distance:
Total southerly distance = 300 miles - 36 miles
Total southerly distance = 264 miles

Finally, the bird flies towards the south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 110 miles

To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we add the total southerly distance and the distance traveled in the final southerly direction:
Total distance = Total southerly distance + Distance in the final southerly direction
Total distance = 264 miles + 110 miles
Total distance = 374 miles

"To find the total number of brownies Greta had left over, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and subtract the number of brownies eaten.

Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself, which is 12 brownies.

At her office, she received 1/2 a dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies.

Her friends at home had 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies.

So, the total number of brownies Greta received is 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

To find the number of brownies Greta had left over, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies she received: 66 - 18 = 48.

"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to find the age of Nani's brother and sister first.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means her age is 75% of Nani's age. To find 75% of Nani's age, we multiply his age by 0.75: 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we have the ages of all three family members: Nani (8 years), his brother (16 years), and his sister (6 years). 

The total age of all three family members is 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones.

The cost of the first two phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.

The cost of each of the remaining phones is half the price of the first phone, which is $600 / 2 = $300.

Since there are 2 kids and 1 wife, there are a total of 3 remaining phones. The cost of these phones is 3 * $300 = $900.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones: $1200 + $900 = $2100.

"To find the total number of players in both teams, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team by adding 7 to 13.

Number of players on Zeke's team = 13 + 7 = 20

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team.

Total number of players = 20 (Zeke's team) + 13 (Carlton's team) = 33

Given that the length (l) is 15 feet and the width (w) is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(15 + 10)
P = 2(25)
P = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

Total slats needed = 50 * 2
Total slats needed = 100

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we first need to determine the total number of oranges she had initially. 

Since she bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges is 12 * 20 = 240.

Then, she gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each, which is a total of 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, she gave away 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

So, the number of oranges she had left is 240 - 80 = 160.

Since she kept 1/4 of the oranges, she kept 1/4 * 160 = 40 oranges.

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges she had left: 160 - 40 = 120.

"To solve this problem, we need to know the number of states in the USA and India. 

The USA has 50 states. 

Let's denote the number of states in India as 'x'. According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, we can write the equation as:

x = (50 / 2) + 4

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 25 + 4
x = 29

Now, we know the number of states in India is 29. To find the total number of states in both countries together, we add the number of states in the USA and India:

Total number of states = 50 (USA) + 29 (India)
Total number of states = 79

"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books. 

The total cost of the books is the sum of the cost of the dictionary, the dinosaur book, and the children's cookbook. 

Total cost = $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, we need to subtract this from the total cost to find out how much more he needs to earn.

Amount needed to earn = Total cost - Amount saved = $39 - $14 = $25

Now, we can find out how many hours Tyler needs to work by dividing the amount he needs to earn by his hourly wage.

Hours needed to work = Amount needed to earn / Hourly wage = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cherries Richard and Jerry have. 

Since Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more than Richard, we can set up an equation to find out how many cherries Richard has. Let's denote the number of cherries Richard has as R. Then, we have:

R + 10 = 30

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation, we get:

R = 20

So, Richard has 20 cherries.

Now, we know that the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert and Richard have 30 and 20 cherries respectively. To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we can subtract the total number of cherries Robert and Richard have from the total number of cherries:

60 - (30 + 20) = 60 - 50 = 10

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many boxes of gingerbread and apple pie Sunny sold on both days and then calculate the total earnings.

Let's denote the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday as G and the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday as A.

We know that on Saturday, Sunny sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. So, the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday is A + 4.

We also know that on Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday. So, the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday is G + 5.

We are given that on Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. Therefore, A + 4 = 15, which implies A = 11.

We are also given that on Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday. Therefore, G + 5 = G + 5, which implies G = 10.

Now, we know that Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread on Saturday and 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday. 

On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie and 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread.

The total earnings from gingerbread on Saturday is 10 * 6 = 60 dollars.
The total earnings from apple pie on Saturday is 11 * 15 = 165 dollars.
The total earnings from gingerbread on Sunday is 15 * 6 = 90 dollars.
The total earnings from apple pie on Sunday is 15 * 15 = 225 dollars.

The total earnings for two days is 60 + 165 + 90 + 225 = 540 dollars.

"To find out how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we need to calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use over the 8 days.

Since she reapplies sunscreen every hour and will be outside 4 hours a day, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day. 

Over 8 days, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times/day * 8 days = 32 times.

Each application is 1 ounce, so she will use 32 ounces of sunscreen in total.

Since each bottle contains 8 ounces, we need to divide the total amount of sunscreen she will use (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces) to find out how many bottles she will need:

32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Emil is 19 years old now.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

From point 3, we can deduce that Emil's brother is currently half of Emil's age when Emil turns 24. Since Emil is 19 now, when he turns 24, he will be 24 - 19 = 5 years older. Therefore, his brother's age when Emil turns 24 will be 5 / 2 = 2.5 years.

Now, we know that when Emil turns 24, his brother will be 2.5 years old. This means his brother is currently 2.5 - 5 = -2.5 years old when Emil is 19. However, age cannot be negative, so this is a contradiction. This means our initial assumption that Emil's brother is half of Emil's age when Emil turns 24 is incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the information. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. This means his dad's age when Emil turns 24 will be 24 * 2 = 48 years.

Now, let's find Emil's dad's current age. Since Emil is 19 now, his dad's age when Emil turns 24 will be 48 - 5 = 43 years. However, this is the age of Emil's dad when Emil is 24, not now. To find Emil's dad's current age, we need to subtract 19 from 43, which is 43 - 19 = 24.

Now that we have Emil's dad's age, we can find Emil's brother's age. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. This means his brother's age when Emil turns 24 will be 24 / 2 = 12 years.

To find Emil's brother's current age, we subtract 5 from 12, which is 12 - 5 = 7.

Now that we have Emil's dad's age and his brother's age, we can find the sum of their ages. The sum of their ages is 24 + 7 = 31.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, we add the amount he caught each day: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings: 21 / 3 = 7.

"To find the number of students leaving early, we first need to find the number of football players, and then add the number of cheerleaders or band members.

First, let's find the number of football players. 20% of 30 students are football players. 

20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6

So, there are 6 football players.

Now, let's find the number of remaining students. Since 6 students are football players, the remaining students are 30 - 6 = 24.

Out of the remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band.

25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6

So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members.

Now, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early.

6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie's boots are size 5, we can multiply 5 by 5 to find Charlie's boot size.

Charlie's boot size = 5 * 5 = 25

Now, we need to find the average of Sophie's and Charlie's boot sizes. To do this, we add their sizes and divide by 2.

Average size = (Sophie's size + Charlie's size) / 2
Average size = (5 + 25) / 2
Average size = 30 / 2
Average size = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to calculate the total space available for plants. Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant, we need to subtract the space between plants from the total length of the flower bed.

First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches, since the width of the plants is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Now, let's calculate the total space available for plants. We need to subtract the space between plants from the total length of the flower bed. Since there are 17 plants, there will be 16 spaces between them. The space between each plant is 1.5 feet, which is 18 inches (1.5 * 12 = 18). 

Total space available for plants = 1332 inches - (16 * 18 inches) = 1332 - 288 = 1044 inches

Now, let's calculate the number of plants that can fit in the flower bed. The width of each plant is 12 inches, so:

Number of plants = Total space available for plants / Width of each plant
= 1044 / 12
= 87

However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she only needs to buy 87 - 17 = 70 more flowers.

The cost of each flower is $6, so the total cost will be:

Total cost = Number of flowers to buy * Cost per flower
= 70 * 6
= 420

The final answer is: $420"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day, we need to calculate 1/2 of the number of pretzels Edgar eats in a day. 

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. 
1/2 of 18 is 18 / 2 = 9 pretzels.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to multiply the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day by 7.

9 pretzels/day * 7 days = 63 pretzels

The final answer is: 63"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

The cost of petunias in one basket is 3 * $3.00 = $9.00.
The cost of sweet potato vines in one basket is 2 * $2.50 = $5.00.

The total cost for one basket is $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00.

Since Katherine has 5 baskets, the total cost will be 5 * $14.00 = $70.00.

The final answer is: $70.00"
"To find out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we first need to determine how much soil is left after planting the sunflowers and carnations.

The total amount of soil used for sunflowers is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.
The total amount of soil used for carnations is 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds.
The total amount of soil used for both sunflowers and carnations is 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Since they started with a 30-pound bag of soil, the amount of soil left is 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil, so the number of roses they can plant is 3 / 1 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we first need to calculate how much she sets aside each month for shoes. 

Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets 25% of her paycheck aside for shoes. To find 25% of $2,000.00, we multiply $2,000.00 by 0.25 (since 25% is equivalent to 0.25).

$2,000.00 * 0.25 = $500.00

So, Jessica sets aside $500.00 each month for shoes.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly savings by 12 to find the total savings in a year.

$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy with $6,000.00. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two separate tasks: peeling and cooking. 

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. Emily can peel 6 shrimp a minute, so to find the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 6. 

90 / 6 = 15 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp. Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so to find the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp, we need to find out how many batches of 30 shrimp she needs to cook. 

90 / 30 = 3 batches

Since each batch takes 10 minutes, we multiply the number of batches by the time per batch.

3 batches * 10 minutes/batch = 30 minutes

However, we need to add the time it takes to peel the shrimp to the time it takes to cook them. 

15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (cooking) = 45 minutes

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

The final answer is: 45"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in temperature after the air conditioner has been running and turned off.

First, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner is running on low for 3 hours:

Temperature change on low = -2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = -6 degrees

Next, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner is running on high for 4 hours:

Temperature change on high = -3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = -12 degrees

Now, let's calculate the total temperature change when the air conditioner is running:

Total temperature change while running = -6 degrees + (-12 degrees) = -18 degrees

The air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, and the room warms up at 2 degrees an hour. So, the temperature change while the air conditioner is off is:

Temperature change while off = 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees

Now, let's calculate the net temperature change:

Net temperature change = Total temperature change while running + Temperature change while off
= -18 degrees + 4 degrees
= -14 degrees

Since the net temperature change is -14 degrees, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature."
"To solve this problem, we need to find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time. 

Let's denote Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as 'x'. Since Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, and Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, we can set up the following equation:

x + 75 = 3(30 + 75)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 75 = 3(105)
x + 75 = 315
x = 240

However, this is the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time. To find his age when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to subtract 75 years from this age.

x - 75 = 240 - 75
x = 165

So, Bill was 165 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

The final answer is: 165"
"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each type and then add them together.

1. Checks for the electric bill: Since Buford writes a check once per month, and there are 12 months in a year, he writes 12 checks for the electric bill.
2. Checks for the gas bill: Similarly, he writes a check once per month for the gas bill, so he also writes 12 checks for the gas bill.
3. Checks to the church: Buford writes a check twice per month to the church, so in a year, he writes 2 * 12 = 24 checks to the church.
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: He writes a check quarterly, which means 4 times a year, so he writes 4 checks to the pest and lawn service.

Now, let's add up the total number of checks: 
12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52

The final answer is: 52"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as x. Since the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, the number of flights to Greece is (3/4)x. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is (1/4)x.

We are given that the second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, the total number of flights made by the first plane is 2 * 44 = 88.

Now, we can set up an equation to find the number of flights to France:

(1/4)x = (1/4) * 88

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4:

x = 88

Now that we know the total number of flights made by the first plane, we can find the number of flights to France:

(1/4)x = (1/4) * 88
= 22

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the individual howling times and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to determine the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6. 
His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since the trousers cost $30, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers to find out how much he had to contribute from his savings: $30 - $18 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W. We know that the total age of the children is 20, and Akbar and Alessandro are 3 and 4 years old, respectively. 

The total age of Akbar and Alessandro is 3 + 4 = 7. Since the total age of all four children is 20, the combined age of Helene and Wilfred is 20 - 7 = 13.

We are also given that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Let's denote the average age of the group as A. Then, Helene's age is 2A.

The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 20/4 = 5. So, A = 5.

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, Helene's age is 2A = 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we know that the combined age of Helene and Wilfred is 13, and Helene is 10 years old. Therefore, Wilfred's age is 13 - 10 = 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund, and then multiply it by 3.

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. 

Total amount collected so far = $500 + $1500 = $2000

Walter's friend donates $200, but this is not included in the amount that the lawyer will base his donation on. The lawyer will donate three times the amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, which is $2000.

So, the lawyer will donate 3 * $2000 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"
"To find the total number of cookies, we multiply the number of guests by the number of cookies each guest brought. 

Total cookies = 100 guests * 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies

Since the bride gave 1/2 of the cookies to the church, we need to find 1/2 of 1500.

1/2 of 1500 = 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies

Now, we know that each person in the church got 15 cookies. To find the number of people in the church, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got.

Number of people in the church = 750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 50 people

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, let's assume the total watermelon is divided into 6 equal slices. Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as 'x'. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the size of each adult's slice is 2x.

The total number of slices is 6, so the sum of all slices is 6x. 

The 2 adults get 2 * 2x = 4x slices, and the 4 kids get 4 * x = 4x slices. 

Since the total number of slices is 6x, we can set up the equation: 4x + 4x = 6x. This equation is true, so the total number of slices is indeed 6x.

Now, we want to find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. Each adult gets 2x slices, and the total number of slices is 6x. To find the percentage, we can divide the number of slices each adult gets by the total number of slices and multiply by 100:

(2x / 6x) * 100 = (1/3) * 100 = 33.33%

So, each adult gets 33.33% of the watermelon.

The final answer is: 33.33"
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on rounds and appointments, and then subtract that from the total hours he works.

First, let's calculate the time spent on rounds:
- Time spent on rounds = Number of inpatients * Time per inpatient
= 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient
= 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time spent on rounds to hours:
- Time spent on rounds (in hours) = 180 minutes / 60
= 3 hours

Next, let's calculate the time spent on appointments:
- Time spent on appointments = Number of appointments * Time per appointment
= 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment
= 300 minutes

Converting the time spent on appointments to hours:
- Time spent on appointments (in hours) = 300 minutes / 60
= 5 hours

Now, let's add the time spent on rounds and appointments to find the total time spent:
- Total time spent = Time spent on rounds + Time spent on appointments
= 3 hours + 5 hours
= 8 hours

Since Doctor Jones works 9 hours, we can subtract the total time spent from the total hours worked to find the time left for updating records:
- Time left for updating records = Total hours worked - Total time spent
= 9 hours - 8 hours
= 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake. 

First, let's convert the time to make the cake batter and bake the cake into hours. 
20 minutes is 20/60 = 1/3 hours, and 30 minutes is 30/60 = 1/2 hours. 

The total time for making the cake batter and baking the cake is 1/3 + 1/2 = 5/6 hours.

The total time required to cool the cake is 2 hours. 

The total time required to frost the cake is 10 minutes, which is 10/60 = 1/6 hours.

The total time required to make the cake is 5/6 + 2 + 1/6 = 2 1/3 + 2 = 4 1/3 hours.

Since Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we need to subtract the total time required to make the cake from 5:00 pm to find the latest time she can start making the cake.

Let's convert 5:00 pm to a 24-hour clock: 5:00 pm is 17:00.

The latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 17:00 - 4 1/3 hours. 

To subtract 4 1/3 hours from 17:00, we can convert 4 1/3 hours to a decimal: 4 1/3 = 13/3 = 4.33 hours.

17:00 - 4.33 hours = 12:27.

The latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 12:27 pm.

The final answer is 12:27."
"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. Since Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. Similarly, Peter sold 4.5x chocolate bars. Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars, so we can set up the equation:

3.5x + 4.5x = 64

Combine like terms:

8x = 64

Divide both sides by 8:

x = 8

The number of chocolate bars in a box is 8."
"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of the students per session, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25. 
The cost of students per session is $1.50 per student, and there are 10 students, so the total cost of students per session is 10 * $1.50 = $15.

The total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $15 (students) = $40.

The studio is rented 3 days a week, so the number of sessions per week is 3. 
There are 4 weeks in a month, so the total number of sessions in a month is 3 * 4 = 12.

The total earnings per session is $40. 
The total earnings in a month is $40 * 12 = $480.

The total earnings of the dance studio in a month is $480.

$480"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box for both Peter and Martha, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

For Peter: 64 chocolate bars / 4 boxes = 16 chocolate bars per box
For Martha: 56 chocolate bars / 7 boxes = 8 chocolate bars per box

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha:
16 (Peter's chocolate bars per box) - 8 (Martha's chocolate bars per box) = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we multiply the total population by 3/5.

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of babies born in a month is 30 * 4 = 120.

In a year, there are 12 months, so the total number of babies born in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The initial population of porcupines is 50, and 1440 babies are added in a year. Therefore, the total population after a year is 50 + 1440 = 1490.

The final answer is: 1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as a swimming pool) is V = lwh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height (or depth).

Given the dimensions of the pool: 
- Length (l) = 25 feet
- Width (w) = 14 feet
- Depth (h) = 4 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:
V = lwh = 25 * 14 * 4 = 1400 cubic feet

The pool company instructed them to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate how many gallons of water they need. 
1400 * 5.9 = 8260 gallons

The cost for the pool company to come and fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon:
8260 * 0.10 = 826

The final answer is: $826"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to determine the number of blue and yellow sticks in addition to the 9 red sticks.

First, we know there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. Since there are 9 red sticks, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

Next, we know the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks. Since there are 14 blue sticks, the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the distance traveled by Matteo, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles.

To find the distance traveled by Shandy, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles.

Now, we subtract the distance traveled by Matteo from the distance traveled by Shandy to find the difference: 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the number of female students, we first need to find the number of students over 16 and under 16, and then find the number of female students in each group.

Let's start by finding the number of students over 16 years old. Since half of the students are over 16, we have:
3000 / 2 = 1500 students over 16 years old.

Now, let's find the number of male students over 16 years old. Since one-fourth of the students over 16 are male, we have:
1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16 years old.

Now, let's find the number of female students over 16 years old. Since there are 1500 students over 16 and 375 are male, we have:
1500 - 375 = 1125 female students over 16 years old.

Next, let's find the number of students under 16 years old. Since the remaining half of the students are under 16, we have:
3000 / 2 = 1500 students under 16 years old.

Now, let's find the number of male students under 16 years old. Since one-half of the students under 16 are male, we have:
1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16 years old.

Now, let's find the number of female students under 16 years old. Since there are 1500 students under 16 and 750 are male, we have:
1500 - 750 = 750 female students under 16 years old.

Now, let's find the total number of female students. We have 1125 female students over 16 and 750 female students under 16:
1125 + 750 = 1875

"To find the number of laps each person can run, we need to calculate their individual lap counts.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find the difference in the number of laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's lap count from Bethany's lap count: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank and subtract it from the tank's capacity.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is (1/4) * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped (3/4) * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is (2/3) * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is (1/3) * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons. 

The remaining amount of water needed to fill the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we can break it down into two parts: the first part where the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour for 5 hours, and the second part where it loses 7% of its capacity per hour for 3 hours.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x.

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. This can be represented as:

x - (x * 0.09) * 5 = x - 0.45x = 0.55x

After 5 hours, the charge remaining is 0.55x.

In the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. This can be represented as:

0.55x - (0.55x * 0.07) * 3 = 0.55x - 0.165x = 0.385x

After 8 hours, the charge remaining is 0.385x.

We are given that the final charge remaining is 28% of the initial charge. This can be represented as:

0.385x = 0.28x

To find the initial charge, we can divide both sides by 0.28:

x = 0.385x / 0.28
x = 1.375x / 0.28
x = 1.375 / 0.28
x = 4.898

The charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 4.898 or 98.98% of the total capacity.

The final answer is: 98.98"
"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings. 

Her hourly wage is $10, and her hourly tips are $15. So, her total hourly earnings are $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1000.

Now, we need to find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of the car, which is 20% of $10,000. 

20% of $10,000 is 0.20 * $10,000 = $2000.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Janet to save $2000. We can do this by dividing the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her weekly earnings ($1000).

$2000 / $1000 = 2.

Therefore, Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has spent so far and subtract that from the $10 he has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items he has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.5 each: 4 * $0.5 = $2
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost so far: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Now, let's subtract the total cost from the $10 Jamaar has:

$10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can divide the remaining amount by the cost of one plum to find out how many plums Jamaar can buy:

$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"To find out how many pieces of sweets each friend received, we first need to determine the total number of pieces in the box and then divide that by the number of friends.

The box contains 15 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, the total number of pieces in the box is 15 * 60 = 900.

Since Anne kept 2 packs, she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs to her friends.

Each pack has 60 pieces, so the total number of pieces given away is 13 * 60 = 780.

Now, we divide the total number of pieces given away by the number of friends to find out how many pieces each friend received: 780 / 10 = 78.

The final answer is: 78"
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures by 8.

Total pictures = 72
Number of albums = 8
Pictures per album = Total pictures / Number of albums
Pictures per album = 72 / 8
Pictures per album = 9

Now, we know that 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits. Since the number of pictures per album is 9, we can multiply this by the number of albums for each category to find the total number of selfies and portraits.

Selfies = Pictures per album * Number of selfie albums
Selfies = 9 * 3
Selfies = 27

Portraits = Pictures per album * Number of portrait albums
Portraits = 9 * 2
Portraits = 18

The final answer is: 
Selfies: 27
Portraits: 18"
"To find the total time James spends reading, we need to determine how many sets of 3 pages he reads and then multiply that by the time it takes to read one set, and add the time it takes to read the remaining pages.

Since James reads 18 pages, we can divide 18 by 3 to find the number of sets of 3 pages he reads: 18 / 3 = 6.

Since it takes James 10 minutes to read one set of 3 pages, we multiply the number of sets by the time it takes to read one set: 6 * 10 = 60 minutes.

However, James also reads the remaining 0 pages (since 18 is divisible by 3) in the last set, so we don't need to add any additional time.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to calculate the number of guests who checked in and subtract the number of guests who checked out.

Initially, there were 100 guests.

24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests remaining is 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, so the number of guests remaining is 76 - 15 = 61.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30.

So, the number of guests now is 61 + 30 = 91.

After dinner, 7 more people checked in, so the final number of guests is 91 + 7 = 98.

The final number of guests in the hotel is 98."

"To find the number of points Aries is sure to get, we need to calculate the number of questions in each category and then find the number of questions Aries is sure to get in each category.

First, let's find the number of questions in each category:
- Easy questions: 40% of 60 = 0.4 * 60 = 24 questions
- Average and difficult questions: 60 - 24 = 36 questions
- Since the rest are equally divided as average and difficult questions, we have 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Now, let's find the number of questions Aries is sure to get in each category:
- Easy questions: 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18 questions
- Average questions: 50% of 18 = 0.5 * 18 = 9 questions

"Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 's' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'l'. We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write an equation: s = 2l.

We also know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * 4 = $12.

The total earnings from the sales are $120. The earnings from the small stuffed animals are 4s, and the earnings from the large stuffed animals are 12l. We can write the equation: 4s + 12l = 120.

Substituting s = 2l into the second equation, we get: 4(2l) + 12l = 120. Simplifying this equation, we get 8l + 12l = 120, which is 20l = 120.

Dividing both sides by 20, we get l = 6. Since s = 2l, we can substitute l = 6 into this equation to get s = 2 * 6 = 12.

"To find the total number of sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches each person eats in a week and then add them together.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, so in a week (7 days), he eats 5 * 7 = 35 sandwiches.

The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, so in a week (7 days), she eats 4 * 7 = 28 sandwiches.

The son eats 2 sandwiches per day, so in a week (7 days), he eats 2 * 7 = 14 sandwiches.

Now, let's add the total number of sandwiches each person eats in a week: 35 (man) + 28 (wife) + 14 (son) = 77 sandwiches.

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week.

"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings and then subtract the amount she gave to her sisters.

First, let's calculate her earnings from selling cookies: 
80 cookies * $1 each = $80

Next, let's calculate her earnings from selling cupcakes: 
60 cupcakes * $4 each = $240

Now, let's add her earnings from cookies and cupcakes: 
$80 + $240 = $320

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so the total amount she gave away is: 
2 * $10 = $20

Now, let's subtract the amount she gave away from her total earnings: 
$320 - $20 = $300

"To find the number of eggs found by the friends, we first need to determine the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins and then subtract that from the total number of eggs.

The Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so together they found 30 * 2 = 60 eggs.

Now, we subtract the number of eggs found by the Smith twins from the total number of eggs to find the number of eggs left for their friends. 

Total eggs = 100
Eggs found by Smith twins = 60
Eggs left for friends = Total eggs - Eggs found by Smith twins = 100 - 60 = 40

However, we are told that all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. This means that the friends found 40 - 10 = 30 eggs.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then multiply it by 40 dwarves and 30 days.

First, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe. Since he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe as with his bare hands, he can mine 2 * 12 = 24 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe.

Next, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. Since he can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe, he can mine 24 + (0.5 * 24) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes. Since one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, 40 dwarves can mine 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds of ore per day.

Finally, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in 30 days with steel pickaxes. Since they can mine 1440 pounds of ore per day, they can mine 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds of ore in 30 days.

"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for the first two packages. 

The ratio for the first package is 3/2, and for the second package is 6/4. We can simplify these ratios to find the price per sandwich. 

The ratio for the first package simplifies to 3/2, and for the second package, it simplifies to 6/4 or 3/2. 

Since the ratios are the same, the price per sandwich is consistent across both packages. 

Now, we can use this ratio to find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches. 

The price per sandwich is 3/2. To find the price for 8 sandwiches, we multiply the price per sandwich by 8: (3/2) * 8 = 24/2 = 12.

The price of the package with 8 sandwiches is $12.

"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to first calculate the remaining amount he owes after selling his old bedroom set.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount received from selling the old bedroom set: $1000
Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we can calculate the monthly payment as follows:

Monthly payment = 10% of $2000
= 0.10 x $2000
= $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 40% of 25 is 0.4 * 25 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 12 / 2 = 6. So, 6 yellow balloons were released, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Then, Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

Now, let's calculate the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school. She had 15 red balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons. 

Total number of balloons = 15 + 6 + 6 = 27

"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability of the complement of the event that he won't have to turn it in. 

There are three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 

1. The substitute teacher doesn't collect the homework (50% chance), 
2. The normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance), 
3. The normal teacher doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment (20% chance).

However, the last scenario is conditional on the second one not happening. So, we need to find the probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension, which is 100% - 40% = 60%. 

Now, we can find the probability of the third scenario: 60% * 20% = 12%.

The probability of the first scenario is 50%. 

The probability of the second scenario is 40%.

Now, we can add the probabilities of the first and second scenarios: 50% + 40% = 90%.

However, we need to subtract the probability of the third scenario from the sum of the first two scenarios because it's included in the first two scenarios. The probability of the third scenario is 12%. 

So, the probability that Marcus won't have to turn in his homework is 90% - 12% = 78%.

The probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is the complement of the event that he won't have to turn it in, which is 100% - 78% = 22%.

"To find out how many tickets each graduate can receive, we first need to determine the total number of available seats for guests. 

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center = 6000
Seats for graduates = 950
Seats for faculty = 300

Total seats taken = 950 (graduates) + 300 (faculty) = 1250

Available seats for guests = Total capacity - Total seats taken
= 6000 - 1250
= 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive.

Tickets per graduate = Available seats for guests / Number of graduates

"To solve this problem, we need to find the relationship between the number of small beans and the number of large beans. 

Let's start by using the information that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. This means that the number of small beans is 3 times the number of medium beans.

Since Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, the number of medium beans is 2 times the number of large beans. 

Let's denote the number of large beans as L. Then the number of medium beans is 2L, and the number of small beans is 3(2L) = 6L.

We are given that it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up. Therefore, L = 75.

Now, we can find the number of small beans by substituting L = 75 into the expression for the number of small beans: 6L = 6(75) = 450.

"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total earnings and total expenses.

Total earnings = Daily earnings * Number of days
Total earnings = $15/day * 3 days = $45

Total expenses = Daily expenses * Number of days
Total expenses = $3/day * 3 days = $9

Now, we can find out her net earnings by subtracting total expenses from total earnings.
Net earnings = Total earnings - Total expenses
Net earnings = $45 - $9 = $36

To find out her hourly earnings, we need to divide her net earnings by the total number of hours she worked.
Total hours worked = 6 hours/day * 3 days = 18 hours

Hourly earnings = Net earnings / Total hours worked
Hourly earnings = $36 / 18 hours
Hourly earnings = $2 per hour

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost due to loans and lost income while in college. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of loans he took: 
4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money he lost due to not working while in college. 
His income before college was $25,000/year. 
His income after college is $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year. 
The difference in income is $75,000/year - $25,000/year = $50,000/year. 
The total amount of money he lost due to not working while in college is $50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000.

The total amount of money he needs to earn is the sum of the loans and the lost income: 
$200,000 (loans) + $200,000 (lost income) = $400,000.

Now, let's calculate how long it will take him to earn this amount at his new income of $75,000/year:

The fabric pieces need to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. So, the length of each fabric piece will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet and the width will be 8 + 2 = 10 feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we need to calculate the area of one piece and then multiply it by 2. The area of one piece is length times width: 8 * 10 = 80 square feet. 

Since Jim needs two pieces, we multiply the area of one piece by 2: 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 
17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102. 
So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice as many as Tuesday's delivery is 102 * 2 = 204. 
5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209. 
So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

"Let's denote the share of the first person as x. 

Since the second person took $80 more than the first, the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Combine like terms: x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920.

Combine like terms again: 4x + 240 = 1920.

"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we first need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks have 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since the painters worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to convert 3/8ths to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days to get the total hours worked: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4 to get the hours worked by each painter: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms again:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

Number of balls in the first set = x + 4
= 6 + 4

190 - 80 = 110

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"To find the total amount Alison spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

1. The tank top costs $10.
2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48, but they were on sale for half price. Half of $48 is $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The athletic socks cost $8, and she had a coupon for $2 off, so the socks cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: $10 (tank top) + $15 (shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55.

The final answer is: $55"
"To find the total cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and then multiply it by the cost of each tile.

First, we need to find the area of a single tile. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1 ft, the area of a single tile is:

Area of a single tile = side length * side length
= 1 ft * 1 ft
= 1 sq ft

Now, we need to find the total number of tiles required to cover the kitchen floor. We can do this by dividing the total area of the kitchen floor by the area of a single tile:

Total number of tiles = Total area of kitchen floor / Area of a single tile
= 200 sq ft / 1 sq ft
= 200 tiles

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the total number of tiles by the cost of each tile:

Total cost = Total number of tiles * Cost of each tile
= 200 tiles * $12
= $2400

The final answer is: $2400"
"To find the increased cost of the insurance, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

60% of $120 = 0.6 * 120 = $72

Increased cost = Normal cost + Increased cost = $120 + $72 = $192

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we need to multiply it by 12 to find the yearly cost.

Yearly cost = Increased cost * 12 = $192 * 12 = $2304

The final answer is: $2304"
"To find the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a week, we need to calculate the total number of twin and king size sheets he puts on the beds and divide that by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. Since each twin bed requires 1 set of sheets and the king size bed requires 1 set of sheets, the total number of sets of sheets he puts on the beds is 4 + 1 = 5.

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time, we need to calculate how many twin sets he needs to wash in a week. Since he has 4 twin beds, he needs to wash 4 / 2 = 2 twin sets of sheets every week.

The king size bed requires 1 set of sheets per week, so he needs to wash 1 king set of sheets every week.

In total, Greg needs to wash 2 twin sets + 1 king set = 3 sets of sheets every week.

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time, we need to calculate how many loads of laundry he does in a week. Since he needs to wash 2 twin sets of sheets every week, he needs 2 loads of laundry for the twin sets. He also needs 1 load of laundry for the king size bed. So, in total, he does 2 + 1 = 3 loads of laundry every week.

To find the total number of loads of laundry he does in a year, we multiply the number of loads he does in a week by the number of weeks in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads of laundry he does in a year is 3 * 52 = 156.

The final answer is: 156"
"To find the total number of movies Jill and her friends watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of movies they watch in one weekend and then multiply it by 4.

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in one weekend, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

To find the total number of movies they watch in 4 weeks, we multiply the number of movies they watch in one weekend by 4: 6 * 4 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to calculate the number of stickers he collected this year and add it to the total number of stickers he had two years ago and last year.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. 
Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.
This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Now, we add the number of stickers he had last year to the number of stickers he collected this year: 150 + 100 = 250 stickers.

The total number of stickers Leo has in his collection is 250.

250"
"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to calculate the total amount of food Imma's cats eat per day and then divide the total amount of food available by that amount.

Imma has 3 cats and feeds them twice a day with 60 grams of cat food each time. So, the total amount of food her cats eat per day is:

3 cats * 2 meals/day * 60 grams/meal = 360 grams/day

Now, we need to divide the total amount of food available (720 grams) by the amount of food eaten per day (360 grams):

720 grams / 360 grams/day = 2 days

The cat food will last for 2 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many slices Jake and Silvia ate. 

Since Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake, Jake must have eaten 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

Now, we know that Becky ate 10 slices, Jake ate 7 slices, and Silvia ate 14 slices. To find the total number of slices they ate, we add these numbers together: 10 + 7 + 14 = 31.

The final answer is: 31"
"Let's denote the time Donovan took as 'x'. Since Betsy took 18 minutes longer than Donovan, the time Betsy took is 'x + 18'. 

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of the time taken by both Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. So, we can write the equation as:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since x is the time Donovan took, and Betsy took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's time is x + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

The final answer is: 58"
"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the costs of the cast, the visit, the painkillers, and the parking.

1. The cost of the cast is $200.
2. The cost of the visit is $300/hour for 0.5 hours (since it's a 30-minute visit). So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.
3. The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill for 30 pills. So, the cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.
4. The cost of parking is $6/hour for 2 hours. So, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up the costs: $200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The final answer is: $482"
"To find out how many emails James responds to, we first need to find out how many emails he doesn't respond to. 

20% of 80 emails is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails. 

Since James doesn't respond to these 16 emails, he responds to the rest, which is 80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Now, we need to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week. 

Since James responds to 64 emails per day, in a 5-day work week, he responds to 64 * 5 = 320 emails.

The final answer is: 320"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we need to calculate the number of classes that visited each day and then add them up.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the number of classes that visited each day:
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 207

"To find the average score across the 4 tests, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the number of tests.

John's scores on the first 3 tests are 100, 100, and 100. 
The sum of these scores is 100 + 100 + 100 = 300.

Adding the score of the 4th test, which is 80, to the sum gives us 300 + 80 = 380.

Now, we divide the total sum by the number of tests, which is 4. 
The average score is 380 / 4 = 95.

The final answer is: 95"
"To find the total number of pizzas left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team, and then subtract that from the total number of pizzas ordered.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club, we multiply 20 by 0.7:
20 * 0.7 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them, which is 40 * 0.8 = 32 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas eaten is 14 (by the glee club) + 32 (by the football team) = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered is 20 (by the glee club) + 40 (by the football team) = 60 pizzas.

To find the number of pizzas left, we subtract the total number of pizzas eaten from the total number of pizzas ordered: 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of big coupons. Since Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and he is sending out 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is 2 * 700 = 1400.

The cost of mailing the small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

The cost of mailing the big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

Now, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons together: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

The final answer is: $245"

1. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. 
   Number of sandwiches ordered by Sidney = 10 - 3 = 7

2. Each sandwich contains 4 meatballs. 
   Total meatballs in 7 sandwiches = 7 * 4 = 28

3. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatballs sub sandwiches. 
   Remaining sandwiches = 7 - 4 = 3

4. Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches. 
   Total remaining sandwiches = 3 + 3 = 6

5. Total meatballs in 6 sandwiches = 6 * 4 = 24

"To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we first need to find the number of trucks that did not experience mechanical failures. 

Since a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, we can find the number of trucks that failed by dividing the total number of trucks by 4.

Number of trucks that failed = Total number of trucks / 4
= 20 / 4
= 5

Now, we can find the number of trucks that did not experience mechanical failures by subtracting the number of failed trucks from the total number of trucks.

Number of trucks that did not fail = Total number of trucks - Number of trucks that failed
= 20 - 5
= 15

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, we can find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers by multiplying the number of trucks that did not fail by the tons of fertiliser each truck was carrying.

Total tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers = Number of trucks that did not fail * Tons of fertiliser per truck
= 15 * 20
= 300

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total cost of the butter, we first need to determine how much Dennis needs to buy. Since he needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

Since the grocery store has a promotion for buy one pound of butter get one half off, we can calculate the cost as follows:

- For the first pound of butter, the cost is $4.00.
- For the second pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).
- For the third pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).
- For the fourth pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).
- For the fifth pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).
- For the sixth pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).

The total cost of the butter is $4.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 = $12.00.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find the total cost of the party, we need to calculate the number of additional guests beyond the initial 20 and then multiply that by the cost per additional guest. 

First, let's find the total number of guests: 
Kayla invited 25 classmates + 7 dance class girls + 13 family members = 45 guests. 
However, 4 people said they could not come, so the total number of guests is 45 - 4 = 41.

Since the initial 20 guests are included in the rental fee, we need to find the number of additional guests: 
41 (total guests) - 20 (initial guests) = 21 additional guests.

Now, we can calculate the cost for the additional guests: 
21 additional guests * $6 per guest = $126.

Adding the initial rental fee to the cost for the additional guests: 
$125 (rental fee) + $126 (additional guests) = $251.

The final numerical answer is: $251"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume Maggie and Riza initially had x dollars each.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, so she spent 0.25x dollars. This means she has 0.75x dollars left.

Riza spent one-third of her money, so she spent 1/3x dollars. This means she has 2/3x dollars left.

Since they each have $60 left, we can set up the following equations:

0.75x = 60 (for Maggie)
2/3x = 60 (for Riza)

We can solve for x by multiplying both sides of the first equation by 4/3 to get:

x = 60 * (4/3)
x = 80

Now that we know x, we can find the total amount of money they have left:

Maggie has 0.75x = 0.75 * 80 = 60 dollars left
Riza has 2/3x = 2/3 * 80 = 53.33 dollars left

The total amount of money they have left is 60 + 53.33 = 113.33 dollars.

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to determine how many bananas the second monkey eats. 

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Since there are three monkeys and they eat a total of 315 bananas in a week, we need to find out how many bananas they eat in a day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of bananas eaten in a day is 315 / 7 = 45 bananas.

We already know that the first monkey eats 10 bananas and the second monkey eats 14 bananas each day. So, the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas.

The third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day, which is 45 - 24 = 21 bananas.

"To find out how many quarters Jenny leaves with, we first need to determine the total cost of the roses. 

Since roses cost $2 each, and she bought 15 roses, the total cost would be 15 * $2 = $30. However, the florist also offers a dozen roses for $15, which is 12 roses. Since 15 is not a multiple of 12, we can't directly use the dozen deal. So, we'll stick with the individual price of $2 per rose.

Jenny has five $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25. To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she paid with: $25 - $30 = -$5. However, this is not possible since she can't pay with a negative amount. This means she doesn't have enough money to buy 15 roses at $2 each.

Let's re-evaluate the situation. If she buys 12 roses at $2 each, the cost would be 12 * $2 = $24. This is within her budget of $25. The change she would get is $25 - $24 = $1. 

Since the florist only has quarters for change, and $1 is equal to 4 quarters, Jenny would leave with 4 quarters.

"To find the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the time intervals between the trains and the time Paul needs to wait for his train.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the train Paul will board.

Now, we need to find the time Paul needs to wait for his train. Since the current time is not given, we assume Paul starts waiting at time 0. The first train arrives at 10 minutes, but Paul will not board it. The second train arrives at 60 minutes, but Paul will not board it. The third train arrives at 125 minutes, but Paul will not board it. The fourth train arrives at 145 minutes, which is the train Paul will board.

To find the waiting time, we need to subtract the time the first train arrives from the time the fourth train arrives: 145 - 10 = 135 minutes. However, this is not the total waiting time. We need to consider the time Paul waits after the third train leaves the station. The third train leaves the station at 125 minutes, and the fourth train arrives at 145 minutes. So, Paul waits for 145 - 125 = 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station.

The total waiting time is the sum of the time Paul waits after the first train arrives and the time Paul waits after the third train leaves the station: 135 + 20 = 155 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far and then determine how many more weeks it will take her to reach 200 toothpicks.

Melanie saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks, so the total number of toothpicks she has saved is:
10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks for the sculpture, and she already has 120, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs:
200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week, we can divide the number of toothpicks she needs by the number of toothpicks she saves per week to find out how many more weeks it will take her to collect 200 toothpicks:
80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we first need to find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price, so the price he paid is 0.75 * $2000 = $1500.

Then, he sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is 1.2 * $1500 = $1800.

To find the discount percentage, we need to find the difference between the original price and the price at which Mr. Rogers' friend bought it, and then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100.

Discount percentage = ((Original price - Price paid by friend) / Original price) * 100
= (($2000 - $1800) / $2000) * 100
= ($200 / $2000) * 100

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours and then multiply it by the number of springs and the rate at which they create jellyfish.

There are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour. 

In 4 hours, there are 4 * 3600 = 14400 seconds.

Since each spring creates a new jellyfish every second, the rate of jellyfish creation per spring is 1 jellyfish per second.

With 5 springs working at the same rate, the total rate of jellyfish creation is 5 jellyfish per second.

To find the total number of jellyfish created in 14400 seconds, we multiply the rate of jellyfish creation per second by the total number of seconds: 5 * 14400 = 72000.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance James walked and then divide it by his speed.

First, James walked to the store, which is 4 miles away. Then, he walked back home, which is another 4 miles. So, the total distance he walked is 4 + 4 = 8 miles.

Since James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the time it took him to walk the total distance by dividing the total distance by his speed: 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours.

However, this is the total time it took him to walk to the store and back home. Since the question asks for the time it took him to reach the store, we need to divide this time by 2, because he walked to the store and back. 

So, the time it took him to reach the store is 2 hours / 2 = 1 hour.

"To find the total cost of buying bananas individually, we first need to find the total number of bananas. Since Jenny buys 10 bunches with 4 bananas per bunch, the total number of bananas is 10 * 4 = 40.

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

The cost of buying 10 bunches is $3.00 per bunch, so the total cost is 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

The amount saved by buying in bunches is $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as 'x'. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, the amount of fence Harry gets is 'x + 60'.

We know that the total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

This means Sam gets 20 feet of fence. To find out how much is left over, we need to subtract the total amount of fence Sam and Harry have from the total amount of fence. Since Sam has 20 feet and Harry has 20 + 60 = 80 feet, the total amount of fence they have is 20 + 80 = 100 feet. However, the question asks for the amount left over, which is not applicable in this case since they used the entire 100 feet."
"To find the rate of growth per year, we need to divide the growth in 4 years by 4.

"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

Let's start by finding the number of each type of bike sold:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150
- BMX bikes: 300 * 0.15 = 45
- MTB bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each type of bike:
- Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250 (since BMX is half the price of MTB, which is $500, so BMX is $500 / 2 = $250)
- MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add up the earnings from each type of bike to find the total earnings:

First, let's find the total time spent in classes. John takes 2 extra classes, each 40 minutes long, and he goes to class for 5 days a week. 

Time spent in classes per day = 2 * 40 minutes = 80 minutes
Time spent in classes per week = 80 minutes * 5 days = 400 minutes

Now, let's find the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday. John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time. 

First, we need to find the total minutes in a week. There are 24 hours in a day, and 7 days in a week, so there are 24 * 7 = 168 hours in a week. 

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 168 * 60 = 10080 minutes in a week.

Now, we can find the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday. 

Extra time per week = 1/16 * 10080 minutes = 630 minutes

Now, we can find the total time spent learning. 

Total time spent learning = Time spent in classes per week + Extra time per week
Total time spent learning = 400 minutes + 630 minutes = 1030 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 

Total time spent learning in hours = 1030 minutes / 60 = 17.17 hours

The final answer is: 17.17"
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to first find the initial height from which it is dropped. Since the third floor is 24 feet high, the initial height is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

The ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height with each bounce. So, on the first bounce, the height will be 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the height will be 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child in inches. 

The first child is 6 feet tall, which is equal to 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to determine the number of bags sold and then multiply that by the price per bag.

Since the orchard sold a total of 2000 apples and each bag contains 10 apples, we can find the number of bags sold by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:

Number of bags sold = Total apples / Apples per bag
= 2000 / 10
= 200

Now, we can find the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag:

Total earnings = Number of bags sold * Price per bag
= 200 * $5
= $1000

The final answer is: $1000"
"To solve this problem, we can work backwards from the information given. 

Let's start with the fact that the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. Since the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate, the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate must have been twice the amount the Allosaurus ate. 

So, the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate = 2 * 270 = 540 kilograms.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate was half of the original amount. 

Let's call the original amount of meat on the triceratops 'x'. Then, the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate is x/2 = 540.

To find the original amount of meat, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 540 * 2
x = 1080

So, the triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate.

The final answer is: 1080"
"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted and then divide it by the coverage of a gallon of paint to find out how many gallons are needed. After that, we can multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon to get the total cost.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their area is 10 * 8 = 80 square feet each. Since there are two of them, their total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their area is 5 * 8 = 40 square feet each. Since there are two of them, their total area is 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

The total area of all the walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

The cost per gallon is $12, so the total cost is 12 * 12 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to determine the probability of her choosing a shaken can out of the remaining cans.

Initially, there were 12 sodas. Ellen shook 3 of them, so 3 were shaken and 9 were unshaken. She took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas. Her brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken and 7 unshaken sodas.

The total number of sodas left is 2 + 7 = 9. The number of shaken sodas left is 2. 

The probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans: 2/9.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (2/9) * 100 = 22.22%."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add their distances together to find the total distance between them. So, the total distance is 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the total number of people Billy helps, we first need to determine the number of days he works. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days (since April 19th is the last day). So, the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th is 31 + 19 = 50 days.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50 days. To do this, we multiply 50 by 0.20 (which is 20% expressed as a decimal).

20% of 50 days = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days

Now, we subtract the number of days off from the total number of days to find the number of days Billy works.

50 days - 10 days = 40 days

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so we need to find the total number of hours he works in a day. 

3 hours/day * 2 people/hour = 6 people/day

Now, we multiply the number of people he can help per day by the number of days he works.

6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that were transported by the buses and the cars, and then subtract that from the total number of people that were present.

First, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the buses: 
12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the cars: 
20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people

Now, let's add the number of people transported by the buses and the cars: 
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the number of people transported from the total number of people present. However, the total number of people present is not given. We can assume that the total number of people present is the sum of the people transported by the buses and the cars, plus the people who were already inside the church. However, since we don't have information about the people who were already inside the church, we can only calculate the number of people who were transported.

The final answer is: $\boxed{480}$"
"To find Jeff's age, we need to first determine Martha's age, and then add 10 to it. 

Since Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can find Martha's age by subtracting 4 from Mike's age: 
Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now that we know Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age by adding 10 to Martha's age:
Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of each slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: time = length / speed = 300 / 60 = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide: time = length / speed = 240 / 80 = 3 minutes

Now, we need to find the difference in time between the two slides: 
time_difference = time_biggest - time_second_biggest = 5 - 3 = 2 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total time spent on lunches and breaks, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 x 15-minute breaks per day. 
Total time spent per day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 2 x 15 minutes (breaks) = 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60. 
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour.

Now, we multiply the time spent per day by 5 to find the total time spent in 5 days.
1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours.

The total time spent on lunches and breaks after 5 days is 5 hours."
"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can multiply 8 by 3.5 to find Micah's total.

Micah's miles = 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now, we know that the total miles run by all three is 52. We can subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total to find Ahito's miles.

Ahito's miles = Total miles - (Amber's miles + Micah's miles)
Ahito's miles = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's miles = 52 - 36
Ahito's miles = 16

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total amount she spent after returning the item and then add it to the initial charge.

1. Initial charge: $85.00
2. Return: -$15.00 (since she returned an item)
   New balance after return: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

3. Frying pan purchase: 20% off $20.00
   Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
   Price of frying pan: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

4. Towel purchase: 10% off $30.00
   Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
   Price of towels: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

5. Total amount spent after return: $70.00 (initial balance) + $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $113.00

The new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. A fifth of the jellyfish are large.
2. A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light.
3. The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue.
4. When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color.

From point 2, we know that 1/3 of the large jellyfish change color. This means 2/3 of the large jellyfish do not change color. Since the jellyfish that do not change color are small, we can conclude that 2/3 of the large jellyfish are small.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. Then, the number of large jellyfish is x/5, and the number of small jellyfish is 4x/5 (since 4/5 of the jellyfish are small).

We know that 2/3 of the large jellyfish are small, so we can set up the equation:

(2/3)(x/5) = 4x/5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x/15 = 4x/5

Multiplying both sides by 15, we get:

2x = 12x

Subtracting 12x from both sides, we get:

-10x = 0

Dividing both sides by -10, we get:

x = 0

However, this is not a valid solution, as it implies that there are no jellyfish in the tank. Let's re-examine the problem.

We know that 6 jellyfish changed color, and these are 1/3 of the large jellyfish. So, the number of large jellyfish that changed color is 6. Let's denote the number of large jellyfish as 'L'. Then, we can set up the equation:

(1/3)L = 6

Multiplying both sides by 3, we get:

L = 18

Now, we know that 2/3 of the large jellyfish are small, so the number of small jellyfish that are large is (2/3)(18) = 12.

The total number of small jellyfish is the sum of the small jellyfish that are large and the small jellyfish that are small. Let's denote the total number of small jellyfish as 'S'. Then, we can set up the equation:

S = 12 + (4x/5 - 12)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

S = 4x/5 - 12 + 12

S = 4x/5

We know that the total number of jellyfish is the sum of the large jellyfish and the small jellyfish. So, we can set up the equation:

x = L + S

Substituting the values, we get:

x = 18 + 4x/5

Multiplying both sides by 5, we get:

5x = 90 + 4x

Subtracting 4x from both sides, we get:

x = 90

The final answer is: 90"
"To find Caroline's age, we need to first find Ben's age, and then multiply it by 3.

We know Chris is 4 years old. Since Ben is two times older than Chris, we can find Ben's age by multiplying Chris's age by 2.

Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben's age, we can find Caroline's age by multiplying Ben's age by 3.

Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Lauren needs to save for her retirement. 

First, let's calculate her annual expenses in retirement: 40% of $100,000 is 0.4 * $100,000 = $40,000.

Since she plans to live for 20 years, her total expenses will be $40,000 * 20 = $800,000.

Lauren saves 20% of her salary, which is 0.2 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

To find out how many years she needs to work to save $800,000, we can divide the total amount needed by the annual savings: $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save for her retirement. Since she already has a retirement period of 20 years, we need to subtract this from the total number of years: 40 - 20 = 20 years.

"To find the total population of the school, we can use the information given about the boys. Since 40% of the school population is 240 boys, we can set up the equation:

0.4x = 240

where x is the total population of the school.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

Now that we know the total population of the school is 600, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total population:

Number of girls = Total population - Number of boys
= 600 - 240

The total height of the heels for the women wearing 4-inch heels is 3 * 4 = 12 inches.
The total height of the heels for the women wearing 2-inch heels is 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

The average height of heels is the total height of all the heels divided by the total number of women, which is 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Since Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days, we can calculate her daily target by dividing the total miles by the number of days:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Soledad is planning to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is a total of 250 miles per day. To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we subtract her planned daily miles from her target daily miles:

310 miles per day - 250 miles per day = 60 miles per day

So, Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

"To find the total amount the store will receive after selling all the balls, we need to calculate the total revenue from each color of ball and add them together.

The number of red balls is 3, and each red ball costs $9, so the total revenue from red balls is 3 * $9 = $27.

The number of blue balls is 11, and each blue ball costs $5, so the total revenue from blue balls is 11 * $5 = $55.

The number of green balls is 25, and each green ball costs $3, so the total revenue from green balls is 25 * $3 = $75.

Now, we add the revenues from each color of ball together: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157.

"To find the total distance John drives in a round trip, we need to calculate the distance of a single trip and then multiply it by 2.

The distance of a single trip is given by the formula: distance = speed * time. 

Given that the speed is 70 mph and the time is 2 hours, we can plug these values into the formula: distance = 70 * 2 = 140 miles.

Since John makes a round trip, we need to multiply the distance of a single trip by 2: 140 * 2 = 280 miles.

Now, we need to find out how many miles John drives in a month. Since John visits his parents twice a month, we can multiply the total distance of a round trip by 2: 280 * 2 = 560 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we can multiply the number of miles she walks per day by the number of days:

10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

Sofie's distance = 2 * Brian's distance

We know that Sofie's distance is 70 miles, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

70 = 2 * Brian's distance

To find Brian's distance, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Brian's distance = 70 / 2
Brian's distance = 35 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers and then find the remaining number of toys that the fifth worker needs to produce.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour:

2 workers * 6 toys/hour * 10 hours = 120 toys

Next, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour:

2 workers * 4 toys/hour * 10 hours = 80 toys

Now, let's add the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers:

120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys

Since the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to ship the order, the total number of toys needed is 400. Therefore, the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Now, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers:

200 toys

To find the number of toys produced by the fifth worker, we subtract the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers from the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers:

380 toys - 200 toys = 180 toys

Since the fifth worker works for 10 hours, we can find the number of toys produced per hour by dividing the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked:

180 toys / 10 hours = 18 toys/hour

"To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we first need to find the weight of each of his dogs. 

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/4 to find the weight of Elijah's first dog: 60 * (1/4) = 15 pounds.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/2 to find the weight of Elijah's second dog: 60 * (1/2) = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of Elijah's two dogs to find the total weight of his dogs: 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

To find the total weight of all three dogs, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs: 60 + 45 = 105 pounds.

First, we find the total weight of the M&M's: 3 large bags * 10 ounces = 30 ounces.

Since an ounce of M&M's has 30 M&M's, the total number of M&M's is 30 ounces * 30 M&M's/ounce = 900 M&M's.

Now, we need to find out how many small bags John can make. Each small bag contains 10 M&M's. 

To find the number of small bags, we divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag: 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's/small bag = 90 small bags.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the number of days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to first calculate half of the circumference of the earth. 

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of the circumference is 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers at a speed of 400 kilometers per day. 

To do this, we can divide the total distance (20,000 kilometers) by Alfie's speed (400 kilometers per day). 

20,000 kilometers / 400 kilometers per day = 50 days.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of the 2nd fastest car first, and then use that to find the speed of the fastest car.

Let's denote the speed of the average car as A, the speed of the 2nd fastest car as B, and the speed of the fastest car as C.

We are given that A = 120 miles per hour.

We are also given that the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so B = 5A = 5 * 120 = 600 miles per hour.

We are also given that the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, so C = 1.25B = 1.25 * 600 = 750 miles per hour.

Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is 750 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 750"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Liam's age two years ago. Since Liam is 16 years old now, two years ago he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince, so we can set up the equation: 14 = 2x, where x is Vince's age two years ago.

To find Vince's age two years ago, we need to solve for x. Divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 14 / 2 = 7.

Since we found Vince's age two years ago, we need to add 2 to find his current age: x + 2 = 7 + 2 = 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S. We know that A = M, C + S = 30, and C = S + 12.

From the equation C = S + 12, we can express C in terms of S: C = S + 12.

We also know that C + S = 30. Substituting C = S + 12 into this equation, we get S + 12 + S = 30. Combining like terms, we get 2S + 12 = 30.

Subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation, we get 2S = 18. Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 9.

Now that we know S = 9, we can find C by substituting S into the equation C = S + 12: C = 9 + 12 = 21.

Since A = M, and we know that A + M = 56 (since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs), we can express A + M as 2A = 56. Dividing both sides by 2, we get A = 28.

Now that we know A = 28 and C = 21, we can find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold: C - A = 21 - 28 = -7.

The final answer is: $\boxed{-7}$"
"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we first need to find the total number of boxes and the total weight of the crayons and boxes.

Since Nik wants to put the crayons into groups of 8, we can divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find the number of boxes: 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Since each box weighs 8 ounces and there are 25 boxes, the total weight of the boxes is 8 * 25 = 200 ounces.

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, and there are 200 crayons, so the total weight of the crayons is 1 * 200 = 200 ounces.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 200 ounces (boxes) + 200 ounces (crayons) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the total weight from ounces to pounds by dividing by 16: 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much John makes, we need to calculate the total number of planks he can make and then multiply it by the price of each plank.

First, let's find out how many logs John can make from the tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we multiply 80% by the total length of the tree (80 feet).

80% of 80 feet = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet long, we divide the total length of the logs by the length of each log to find the number of logs.

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

Now, we know John can make 16 logs, and from each log, he can cut 5 planks. So, we multiply the number of logs by the number of planks per log.

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

Finally, we multiply the total number of planks by the price of each plank to find out how much John makes.

80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the combined salary of Valerie and her brother, and then add her mother's salary to it.

Let's start by finding Valerie's brother's salary. Since Valerie earns 1/2 of what her brother earns, we can represent her brother's salary as 2 times Valerie's salary. 

Valerie's salary = $5000
Brother's salary = 2 * Valerie's salary = 2 * $5000 = $10,000

Now, we need to find the combined salary of Valerie and her brother. 

Combined salary of Valerie and brother = Valerie's salary + Brother's salary = $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so we can represent her salary as 2 times the combined salary of Valerie and her brother.

Mother's salary = 2 * Combined salary of Valerie and brother = 2 * $15,000 = $30,000

Now, we can find the total amount of money they all have together by adding their individual salaries.

Total amount of money = Valerie's salary + Brother's salary + Mother's salary = $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the speed at which Grandma walks on the beach and the sidewalk. Let's denote the speed on the beach as x miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, and the distance covered on the beach is 2 miles. Using the formula distance = speed * time, we can write:

2 = x * 40

To find the speed on the beach, we can divide both sides by 40:

x = 2 / 40
x = 1/20 miles per minute

Now that we have the speed on the beach, we can find the speed on the sidewalk, which is 2x:

Speed on sidewalk = 2 * (1/20)
Speed on sidewalk = 1/10 miles per minute

Now, we can find the time taken to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk:

Time = distance / speed
Time = 1 / (1/10)
Time = 10 minutes

Since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk, it takes her 10 minutes. Now, we need to find the total time taken for the entire 3-mile walk. We already know that she spends 40 minutes on the beach. The remaining distance is 3 - 2 = 1 mile, which she walks on the sidewalk. We already calculated that it takes her 10 minutes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk.

Total time = time on beach + time on sidewalk
Total time = 40 + 10
Total time = 50 minutes

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Jane to save a total of $60, we first need to calculate how much she has saved so far. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount saved is 4 * 8 = $32.

Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60. This is 60 - 32 = $28.

Since she saves $4 per week, we can find out how many weeks it will take her to save $28 by dividing 28 by 4. 

28 / 4 = 7.

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add up the number of blue birds in each tree. 

First, we have 3 trees with 7 blue birds each, so the total number of blue birds in these trees is 3 * 7 = 21.

Next, we have 2 trees with 4 blue birds each, so the total number of blue birds in these trees is 2 * 4 = 8.

Finally, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds.

To find the total number of blue birds, we add the number of blue birds in each group: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

"Let's denote the initial number of marbles Bob has as 'x'. 

If he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have x + 2*12 = x + 24 marbles. According to the problem, this equals 60. 

So, we can write the equation: x + 24 = 60.

To find the initial number of marbles, we need to solve for x. Subtract 24 from both sides of the equation: x = 60 - 24.

x = 36.

Now, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 36 - 10 marbles.

36 - 10 = 26

The final answer is: 26"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature of the second bottle. 

Let's denote the temperature of the second bottle as x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle, the total temperature of the water in the bottle is the weighted average of the two temperatures. Since the amount of water poured from the second bottle is much smaller than the amount poured from the 33-degree mug, we can approximate the weighted average as the temperature of the 33-degree mug.

However, we know that the water in the bottle is now drinkable, which means it's at least 40 degrees. 

We can set up the inequality:

(33 * 4 + x * 1) / 5 >= 40

Simplifying the inequality:

132 + x >= 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x >= 68

So, the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of cows:

Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 21 days in three weeks. 

Number of cows added in three weeks = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of cows = Initial number of cows + Number of cows added
Total number of cows = 50 + 420
Total number of cows = 470

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens:

Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. 

Number of chickens added in three weeks = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
Total number of chickens = Initial number of chickens + Number of chickens added
Total number of chickens = 20 + 210
Total number of chickens = 230

Now, let's add the total number of cows and chickens to find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks:

Total number of animals = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens
Total number of animals = 470 + 230
Total number of animals = 700

"To find the cost of each single bagel, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels with the 10% discount. 

The original cost of 4 packs of bagels is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00. 

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $40.00. 
10% of $40.00 = 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the original cost to get the discounted cost: 
$40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Since each pack has 9 bagels, the total number of bagels is 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the discounted cost by the total number of bagels: 
$36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops, so we can write this as:

Gomer's scoops = 23 - 5
Gomer's scoops = 18

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops, so we can write this as:

Potatoes per scoop = 6 - 3
Potatoes per scoop = 3

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. We can multiply the number of scoops by the number of potatoes per scoop:

Total potatoes = Gomer's scoops * Potatoes per scoop
Total potatoes = 18 * 3
Total potatoes = 54

"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, and then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days is 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester increases his egg consumption to 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days is 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

Now, we add the total number of eggs from both periods: 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens: 240 eggs / 12 = 20.

"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to determine the total number of red jellybeans. We are given that there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans. 

Let's denote the number of red jellybeans as R and the number of green jellybeans as G. We know that R = 2G. Since we are given that G = 17, we can substitute this value into the equation to find R.

R = 2G
R = 2(17)
R = 34

Now that we know there are 34 red jellybeans, we can find the total number of non-blue jellybeans by adding the number of green and red jellybeans.

Total non-blue jellybeans = G + R
Total non-blue jellybeans = 17 + 34
Total non-blue jellybeans = 51

Since there are a total of 60 jellybeans, we can find the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the total number of non-blue jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans.

Number of blue jellybeans = Total jellybeans - Total non-blue jellybeans
Number of blue jellybeans = 60 - 51
Number of blue jellybeans = 9

"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the total number of lemons he collects in one year and then multiply it by 10.

First, let's find the total number of lemons he collects in one year. Since he has 5 trees and each tree gives 6 lemons, we multiply the number of trees by the number of lemons per tree:

5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons/year

Now, we multiply the number of lemons collected in one year by 10 to find the total number of lemons collected in a decade:

30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women on the bus initially. 

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can let the number of men be 5x and the number of women be 9x. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the equation: 5x + 9x = 84

Combine like terms: 14x = 84

Divide both sides by 14: x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the initial number of women: 9x = 9 * 6 = 54

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining is: 54 - 20 = 34

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many sunflowers and bouquets Faraday sold per day. 

Let's denote the number of sunflowers sold per day as 's' and the number of bouquets sold per day as 'b'. We know that each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, so the total number of sunflowers sold per day is 12b + s.

We are given that Faraday earned $26 from the sunflowers and $56 from the bouquets per day. Since each sunflower costs $2 and each bouquet costs $8, we can set up the following equations:

2s + 8b = 26 (equation 1)
8b = 56 (equation 2)

From equation 2, we can solve for b:
b = 56 / 8
b = 7

Now that we know b, we can substitute this value into equation 1 to solve for s:
2s + 8(7) = 26
2s + 56 = 26
2s = -30
s = -15

However, the number of sunflowers sold per day cannot be negative, so this solution is not valid. Let's re-examine the problem. We can simplify equation 1 by dividing both sides by 2:

"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys, the revenue from selling 60% of the rocks, and then find the difference between the two.

First, let's find out how many rocks Adam can buy with $100. Since each rock costs $5, we divide the total amount by the cost per rock:

100 / 5 = 20 rocks

Now, Adam sells 60% of his inventory, which is 60% of 20 rocks:

60% of 20 = 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks

The revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:

12 * 7 = $84

The cost of buying 20 rocks at $5 each is:

20 * 5 = $100

Since Adam only sells 12 rocks, he still has 8 rocks left, which he didn't sell. The cost of these unsold rocks is:

8 * 5 = $40

However, we need to find the total cost of the rocks he bought, which is the cost of the rocks he sold plus the cost of the rocks he didn't sell:

Total cost = 100 (cost of rocks he sold) + 40 (cost of rocks he didn't sell) = 140

Now, we can find the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks, which is $84. To find the loss, we subtract the total revenue from the total cost:

Loss = Total cost - Total revenue
= 140 - 84
= 56

The final answer is: $56"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene. 

Let's start by finding the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene:

- Large-sized picture scenes: 45 / 5 = 9 days
- Medium-sized picture scenes: 36 / 6 = 6 days
- Small-sized picture scenes: 49 / 7 = 7 days

Now, we need to find the LCM of 9, 6, and 7. 

The prime factorization of 6 is 2 * 3.
The prime factorization of 7 is 7.
The prime factorization of 9 is 3^2.

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:
LCM(6, 7, 9) = 2 * 3^2 * 7 = 2 * 9 * 7 = 126

So, it will take Lauren 126 days to complete all the picture scenes.

The final answer is: 126"
"To find out how many eggs each child receives, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. 

First, let's determine the total number of eggs. Since Chatty prepared three dozen eggs, we need to convert this to a numerical value. One dozen is equal to 12, so three dozen is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children: 36 eggs / 4 children = 9 eggs per child.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to calculate the total cost of food for one month. 

First, we need to determine the number of days in May. May has 31 days.

Since each fish needs $1 worth of food per day, and Jen has 3 fish, the daily cost of food for all her fish is 3 * $1 = $3.

To find the total cost for the month, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days in May: $3 * 31 = $93.

The final numerical answer is: $93"
"To find out how many roses Patricia has now, we need to subtract the number of roses she gave away from the initial number of roses, then add the number of roses she bought.

Initial number of roses: 30
Number of roses given away: 24
Number of roses bought: 15

First, subtract the number of roses given away from the initial number: 30 - 24 = 6
Then, add the number of roses bought: 6 + 15 = 21

So, Patricia now has 21 roses."
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken. 

The total distance traveled is the sum of the two distances: 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles.

The total time taken is the sum of the two times: 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

The average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time: average speed = total distance / total time = 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning. 

The probability of the first ticket winning is 20% or 0.2. 
The probability of the second ticket winning is three times more likely, so it's 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

Now, we multiply the probabilities of both tickets winning: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many seashells Carrey collected first. Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as x.

Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, the number of seashells Carlos collected is 2x.

We are given that Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so the number of seashells Jim collected is 2x + 5.

We know that the total number of seashells collected by all three is the sum of the seashells collected by each of them: x + 2x + (2x + 5) = 5x + 5.

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, each person got (5x + 5) / 3 seashells.

However, we still need to find the value of x. We can do this by using the information that Jim collected 27 seashells. Since Jim collected 2x + 5 seashells, we can set up the equation 2x + 5 = 27.

Solving for x, we get 2x = 22, and x = 11.

Now that we know x, we can find the number of seashells each person got: (5x + 5) / 3 = (5(11) + 5) / 3 = (55 + 5) / 3 = 60 / 3 = 20.

"To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and add the number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday). So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

On Saturday and Sunday, Mason eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 + 5 = 10.

Now, we add the total number of carrots Mason eats on weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week: 20 + 10 = 30.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. 

The second song is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes. To find 60% of 5 minutes, we multiply 5 by 0.6 (which is the decimal form of 60%).

5 * 0.6 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song. To find the total length of the second song, we add 3 minutes to the length of the first song.

5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now, we have the lengths of both songs: 5 minutes for the first song and 8 minutes for the second song. To find the total time of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs.

5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the profit from each day and then add them together.

On Monday, Linus bought 2 devices for $20 each, so the total cost is 2 * $20 = $40. He sold each device for twice the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40. So, the profit from each device is $40 - $20 = $20. Since he bought 2 devices, the total profit from Monday is 2 * $20 = $40.

On Tuesday, Linus bought 4 devices for $20 each, so the total cost is 4 * $20 = $80. He sold each device for twice the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40. So, the profit from each device is $40 - $20 = $20. Since he bought 4 devices, the total profit from Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80.

The total profit is the sum of the profit from Monday and Tuesday, which is $40 + $80 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to determine Carl's height first. We know that Isabel is 7 feet tall and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel. 

Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
Ned's height = 7 - 2
Ned's height = 5 feet

Since Carl is one foot taller than Ned, we can find Carl's height by adding 1 foot to Ned's height.

Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 + 1
Carl's height = 6 feet

We are given that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. To find the length of the cane, we can divide Carl's height by 2.

Length of Carl's cane = Carl's height / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 6 / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 3 feet

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many bottles are required to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people. 

First, we need to find out how many bottles are required to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 1 person. Since each juice can cover 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand, we need to divide 100% by 20% to get the number of bottles required for 1 person.

100% / 20% = 5 bottles per person

Now, we need to find out how many bottles are required to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people. We can multiply the number of bottles required for 1 person by 2300.

5 bottles/person * 2300 people = 11500 bottles

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles it needs to produce to meet the demand of 11500 bottles.

11500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 7300 bottles

The final answer is: 7300"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the number of babies wearing purple and blue. Since Carla has 8 babies and 3/4 of them wear purple, the number of purple babies is 3/4 * 8 = 6. The number of blue babies is 1/4 * 8 = 2.

Next, we need to find the number of babies wearing bows. All 2 blue babies wear bows, and 1/3 of the 6 purple babies also wear bows. So, the number of purple babies wearing bows is 1/3 * 6 = 2. The total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4.

Now, we need to find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This can be calculated by dividing the number of purple babies wearing bows by the total number of babies wearing bows, and then multiplying by 100.

The probability is (2 / 4) * 100 = 50%.

First, let's find the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday. 

Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Now, let's find the total number of reports received on Wednesday by subtracting the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday, and then subtracting that result from the total number of reports received last week.

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received last week - (Reports received on Monday and Tuesday + Reports received on Thursday and Friday)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)

"To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the amount of money he earned from each sale and add them together.

First, Abraham sold half of his land for $50. Since he owns 80 square meters, half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. 

Next, he sold 1/4 of his land for $30. Since he owns 80 square meters, 1/4 of that is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters.

The remaining land is 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters.

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, the amount of money he earned from selling the remaining land is 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he earned. He earned $50 from the first sale, $30 from the second sale, and $60 from the third sale. 

Total money earned = $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many eggs each person finds and then subtract the total from the initial number of eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs. 
Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.
Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

The total number of eggs found is 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27.

Initially, Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, Cole hid 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the total found from the initial number: 36 - 27 = 9.

"To find the total amount John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments in each complex and then the total number of collections he makes in a week.

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so the total number of apartments in these two complexes is 2 * 200 = 400.

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400. 

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. 

So, the last complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

The total number of apartments in all three complexes is 400 + 640 = 1040.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections he makes in a week is 3 * 1040 = 3120.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment, so the total amount he makes in a week is 3120 * $0.40 = $1248.

"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and add them up.

- In the 5th year, the tree produces 50 fruits.
- In the 6th year, the tree produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- In the 7th year, the tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- In the 8th year, the tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Since a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits, an 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.
- In the 9th year, the tree doesn't produce any fruit.
- In the 10th year, the tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced by the tree during its 10 years of life:

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R. 

We are given that R = 4B and B = Y - 7. 

We also know that R + B + Y = 37.

Substituting R = 4B into the equation R + B + Y = 37, we get 4B + B + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5B + Y = 37.

Substituting B = Y - 7 into the equation 5B + Y = 37, we get 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37.

Expanding the equation 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37, we get 5Y - 35 + Y = 37.

Combining like terms in the equation 5Y - 35 + Y = 37, we get 6Y - 35 = 37.

Adding 35 to both sides of the equation 6Y - 35 = 37, we get 6Y = 72.

Dividing both sides of the equation 6Y = 72 by 6, we get Y = 12.

Now that we know Y = 12, we can find B by substituting Y into the equation B = Y - 7. B = 12 - 7 = 5.

Now that we know B = 5, we can find R by substituting B into the equation R = 4B. R = 4 * 5 = 20.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume Ronnie was given x dollars initially. Since Rissa was given thrice as much, Rissa was given 3x dollars.

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Ronnie is left with x - y dollars and Rissa is left with 3x - y dollars, where y is the amount they each gave to their little sister.

We are given that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

3x - y = (4/5)(3x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3x - y = 12x/5

Multiplying both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

15x - 5y = 12x

Subtracting 12x from both sides, we get:

3x - 5y = 0

Now, we need to find the value of y. Since Ronnie and Rissa gave an equal amount of money to their little sister, we can set up the equation:

x - y = (1/2)(3x - y)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - y = (3/2)x - (1/2)y

Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

2x - 2y = 3x - y

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:

-2y = x - y

Adding y to both sides, we get:

-y = x

Multiplying both sides by -1, we get:

y = -x

Now, substitute y = -x into the equation 3x - 5y = 0:

3x - 5(-x) = 0

Expanding the equation, we get:

3x + 5x = 0

Combine like terms:

8x = 0

Dividing both sides by 8, we get:

x = 0

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the value of y:

y = -x
y = -0
y = 0

Now that we have the values of x and y, we can find the amount of money left in Ronnie's pocket:

Ronnie's money = x - y

Multiplying both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

15x - 5y = 12x

Subtracting 12x from both sides, we get:

3x - 5y = 0

Now, we need to find the value of y. Since Ronnie and Rissa gave an equal amount of money to their little sister, we can set up the equation:

x - y = (1/2)(3x - y)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - y = (3/2)x - (1/2)y

Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

2x - 2y = 3x - y

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:

-2y = x - y

Adding y to both sides, we get:

-y = x

Multiplying both sides by -1, we get:

y = -x

Now, substitute y = -x into the equation 3x - 5y = 0:

3x - 5(-x) = 0

Expanding the equation, we get:

3x + 5x = 0

Combine like terms:

8x = 0

Dividing both sides by 8, we get:

x = 0

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the value of y:

Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

2x - 2y = 3x - y

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:

-2y = x - y

Adding y to both sides, we get:

-y = x

Multiplying both sides by -1, we get:

y = -x

Now, substitute y = -x into the equation 3x - 5y = 0:

3x - 5(-x) = 0

Expanding the equation, we get:

3x + 5x = 0

Combine like terms:

8x = 0

Dividing both sides by 8, we get:

x = 0

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the value of y:

y = -x
y = -0
y = 0

However, this is not possible since Ronnie was given $5 initially. Let's re-examine the problem.

Let's assume Ronnie was given x dollars initially. Since Rissa was given thrice as much, Rissa was given 3x dollars.

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Ronnie is left with x - y dollars and Rissa is left with 3x - y dollars, where y is the amount they each gave to their little sister.

We are given that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

3x - y = (4/5)(3x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3x - y = 12x/5

Multiplying both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

15x - 5y = 12x

Subtracting 12x from both sides, we get:

3x - 5y = 0

Now, we need to find the value of y. Since Ronnie and Rissa gave an equal amount of money to their little sister, we can set up the equation:

x - y = (1/2)(3x - y)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - y = (3/2)x - (1/2)y

Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

2x - 2y = 3x - y

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:

-2y = x - y

Adding y to both sides, we get:

-y = x

Multiplying both sides by -1, we get:

y = -x

Now, substitute y = -x into the equation 3x - 5y = 0:

3x - 5(-x) = 0

"Let's break down the information given:

- There are four colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow.
- There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint.
- Half the mural is yellow.
- The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as x. Since there are equal amounts of these three colors, the total amount of these three colors is 3x.

Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, so the sum of all four colors is 12. We can set up the equation:

3x + 6 = 12

Subtract 6 from both sides:

3x = 6

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 2

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, the amount of red paint is x = 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, then add them together.

First, let's find the area of one bedroom: 
Area of one bedroom = length * width = 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms = 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area = 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas together: 
Total area = area of bedrooms + area of living room + area of the rest of the house
Total area = 960 + 1200 + 1000
Total area = 3160 square feet.

On Wednesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.

On Thursday, she counts double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.

On Friday, she counts double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add up the number of clouds for each day: 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93.

Number of pods in the new box = 100 + 20 = 120

Now, we know that the new box costs $12 and has 120 pods. To find out how many cycles we can run for $1, we need to divide the number of pods by the cost of the box and then divide the result by the cost per cycle.

Cost per cycle = $12 / 120 = $0.1 per cycle

Now, we can find the number of cycles we can run for $1:
Number of cycles for $1 = 1 / $0.1 = 10

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since he withdraws 1000 dollars in 20 dollar bills, he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home. So, he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he uses 20 bills to pay for the bill. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he has 20 bills left, and each bill is worth $20, he has 20 * 20 = $400. Tripling this amount gives him 3 * 400 = $1200.

5. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we need to divide the total amount of money by 5. 1200 / 5 = 240.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of goals scored by team A in the first half as A1 and the number of goals scored by team B in the first half as B1.

Given that team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A in the first half, we can write an equation:
B1 = A1 - 2

We are also given that team A scores 4 goals in the first half, so A1 = 4.

Substituting A1 = 4 into the equation B1 = A1 - 2, we get:
B1 = 4 - 2
B1 = 2

Now, let's consider the second half. We are given that team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so the number of goals scored by team B in the second half is 4 * B1 = 4 * 2 = 8.

We are also given that team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half, so the number of goals scored by team A in the second half is (1/4) * 8 = 2.

The total number of goals scored by team A in the match is A1 + (number of goals scored by team A in the second half) = 4 + 2 = 6.

The total number of goals scored by team B in the match is B1 + (number of goals scored by team B in the second half) = 2 + 8 = 10.

The total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by team A and team B: 6 + 10 = 16.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much chalk is left after Monday and then determine how many days it will last.

Initially, the teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. He uses 45% of it on Monday, so the amount of chalk used is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.

The amount of chalk left after Monday is 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.

Since the teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how many days it will last until it reaches 2 inches.

Let's assume the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day. We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Initial chalk - (chalk used each day) = 2

2.75 - (0.20 * x) = 2

where x is the number of days.

Solving for x, we get:

0.20x = 2.75 - 2
0.20x = 0.75
x = 0.75 / 0.20
x = 3.75

Since the teacher can't use a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can use the exact value because the teacher will have chalk left after 3.75 days, but it will be less than 2 inches, so he will have to recycle it on the 4th day.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

Since there are 12 boys and 12 girls in the class, the total number of students is 12 + 12 = 24.

The number of students not on varsity is 24 (total students) - 7 (students on varsity) = 17.

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:

C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we first need to determine the total number of books he can buy with $27000. 

Since he can buy 100 books for $500, we can find the total number of books he can buy by dividing the total amount he has ($27000) by the cost of 100 books ($500).

Total number of books = Total amount / Cost per 100 books
Total number of books = $27000 / $500
Total number of books = 54

Now that we know Bob can buy a total of 54 books, we need to find out how many books he can buy per school. Since he is distributing the books to 3 schools, we divide the total number of books by 3.

Number of books per school = Total number of books / Number of schools
Number of books per school = 54 / 3
Number of books per school = 18

"To solve this problem, we need to find the net rate at which Jay is building snowballs. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in 1 hour, which is equivalent to 60 minutes. So, his rate of building snowballs is 20/60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. To find the rate at which snowballs melt, we divide the number of snowballs that melt by the time it takes for them to melt: 2/15 snowballs per minute.

Now, we need to find the net rate at which Jay is building snowballs. This is the rate at which he builds snowballs minus the rate at which they melt: (1/3) - (2/15) = (5/15) - (2/15) = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Since Jay wants to have 60 snowballs, we need to find out how many minutes it will take to build 60 snowballs at a rate of 1/5 snowballs per minute. 

To do this, we divide the total number of snowballs by the net rate: 60 / (1/5) = 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

However, this is the time it would take if Jay didn't melt any snowballs. Since he melts 2 snowballs every 15 minutes, we need to account for this. 

Let's find the number of 15-minute intervals in 300 minutes: 300 / 15 = 20 intervals.

In each interval, 2 snowballs melt, so in 20 intervals, 20 * 2 = 40 snowballs will melt.

To find the actual number of snowballs Jay will have after 300 minutes, we subtract the number of snowballs that melted from the total number of snowballs he built: 60 - 40 = 20 snowballs.

However, this is not the answer we are looking for. We want to know how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs. 

Let's re-evaluate the situation. Jay builds 20 snowballs in 60 minutes, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. This means that for every 15 minutes, Jay effectively builds 20 - 2 = 18 snowballs.

Since Jay wants to have 60 snowballs, we can divide 60 by 18 to find out how many 15-minute intervals it will take him to build 60 snowballs: 60 / 18 = 3.33 intervals.

Since each interval is 15 minutes, we multiply the number of intervals by the length of each interval: 3.33 * 15 = 49.95 minutes.

However, this is still not the answer we are looking for. We need to account for the fact that Jay builds snowballs at a rate of 20 per hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes.

Let's re-evaluate the situation. Jay builds 20 snowballs in 60 minutes, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. This means that for every 60 minutes, Jay effectively builds 20 - (2 * 4) = 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs.

Since Jay wants to have 60 snowballs, we can divide 60 by 12 to find out how many 60-minute intervals it will take him to build 60 snowballs: 60 / 12 = 5 intervals.

Since each interval is 60 minutes, we multiply the number of intervals by the length of each interval: 5 * 60 = 300 minutes.

However, this is still not the answer we are looking for. We need to account for the fact that Jay builds snowballs at a rate of 20 per hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes.

Let's re-evaluate the situation. Jay builds 20 snowballs in 60 minutes, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. This means that for every 60 minutes, Jay effectively builds 20 - (2 * 4) = 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs.

However, we can also express the rate at which Jay builds snowballs as 20/60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

"To find Jim's age, we need to first determine John's age 20 years ago. Since John is 28 now, we subtract 20 from 28 to find his age at the time of the Digimon release.

28 - 20 = 8

Since John was twice as old as Jim at the time of the Digimon release, we can set up an equation to find Jim's age:

John's age 20 years ago = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago
8 = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago

To find Jim's age 20 years ago, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Jim's age 20 years ago = 8 / 2
Jim's age 20 years ago = 4

Now, we need to find Jim's current age. Since 20 years have passed, we add 20 to Jim's age 20 years ago:

Jim's current age = Jim's age 20 years ago + 20
Jim's current age = 4 + 20
Jim's current age = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of slices each person ate and then add them up.

Doxa ate 1 slice. 
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, let's add up the number of slices they ate: 
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the remaining bandages after the first day are x - 38 + 50.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The remaining bandages after the second day are (x - 38 + 50) - 28.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages (2 * 50 = 100) and used half a pack (50 / 2 = 25 bandages). The remaining bandages after the third day are ((x - 38 + 50) - 28) - 25 + 100.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation:

(x - 38 + 50) - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78

Simplifying the equation:

x - 38 + 50 - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78
x + 57 = 78

Subtracting 57 from both sides:

x = 21

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the total cost of the haircut, we need to calculate the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut separately and then add them together.

The cost of the color is $40, as given.

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, and May's hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches. To find the total inches cut, we subtract the final length from the initial length: 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

Now, we multiply the cost per inch by the total inches cut: 2 inches * $30/inch = $60.

The total cost of the haircut and color is the sum of the color cost and the haircut cost: $40 + $60 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To find Jen's total earnings, we need to calculate her total hours worked and her attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her total hours worked in April. Since there are 4 weeks in April and she works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week, we can calculate her total hours worked as follows:

Total hours worked = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks
Total hours worked = 180 hours

Next, let's calculate her total earnings from her hourly rate:

Total earnings from hourly rate = Total hours worked * Hourly rate
Total earnings from hourly rate = 180 hours * $1.5/hour
Total earnings from hourly rate = $270

Since Jen did not incur any absences for the month, she will receive the attendance bonus of $10.

Total earnings = Total earnings from hourly rate + Attendance bonus
Total earnings = $270 + $10
Total earnings = $280

The final answer is: $280"

"To find the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we first need to find the amount of blood in one shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, a shark has 3 * 40 = 120 gallons of blood.

Now, we need to find the total amount of blood in ten sharks. To do this, we multiply the amount of blood in one shark by the number of sharks: 120 * 10 = 1200 gallons.

The final answer is: 1200"
"To find the total number of people who entered the restaurant, we need to calculate the number of people who entered at each time and add them up.

First, 50 people entered in the morning. 

At 10:00, 40 more people entered, so the total number of people at this point is 50 + 40 = 90.

Then, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. So, the total number of people now is 90 + 80 = 170.

Finally, 3 times as many people as the number that came in first (50) entered by evening, which is 3 * 50 = 150 people. So, the total number of people now is 170 + 150 = 320.

The total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and the number of black pens separately and then add them together.

First, we know that Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Since each pack has 5 pens, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

We are also told that Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. Since there are 25 red pens, the number of black pens is 2 * 25 = 50 black pens.

To find the total number of pens Alain has, we add the number of red pens and the number of black pens: 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately and then add them together.

Let's start with the scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600. To find the cost per bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles:

Cost per bottle of scotch = Total cost / Number of bottles
= $600 / 10
= $60 per bottle

Now, let's find the number of bottles of cognac. John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of cognac per bottle is 50% more than the cost of scotch per bottle. To find the cost of cognac per bottle, we multiply the cost of scotch per bottle by 1.5 (since 50% more is the same as multiplying by 1.5):

Cost per bottle of cognac = Cost per bottle of scotch * 1.5
= $60 * 1.5
= $90 per bottle

Now, we can find the total cost of the cognac by multiplying the cost per bottle by the number of bottles:

Total cost of cognac = Cost per bottle of cognac * Number of bottles of cognac
= $90 * 20
= $1800

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount John spent:

Total amount spent = Total cost of scotch + Total cost of cognac
= $600 + $1800
= $2400

The final answer is: $2400"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. He also planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which means he planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so the total number of White Oak trees becomes 20 + 10 = 30. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days. The total number of White Oak trees is 20 + 30 = 50. The total number of Lodgepole Pine trees is 40 + 50 = 90.

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 50 + 90 = 140.

"To find the amount of root beer available for each person to drink, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer remaining after all the events.

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed by his children, so the remaining amount is:
24 - 4 = 20 gallons

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, so the remaining amount is:
20 - 7 = 13 gallons

On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed by Ronnie, so the remaining amount is:
13 - 5 = 8 gallons

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, and they shared the remaining root beer equally. To find the amount each person got, we divide the remaining amount by the number of people:
8 / 3 = 2.67 gallons

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.67}$"
"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as 'x'. 

The problem statement can be translated into the equation: 4x + 8 = 40.

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable 'x'. 

First, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for 'x': x = 32 / 4
x = 8

The number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 8."
"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we first need to calculate one-third of the total number of fish. 

One-third of 66 is 66 / 3 = 22.

Now, we know that 22 fish have red stripes. To find the number of remaining fish, we subtract the number of fish with red stripes from the total number of fish.

Remaining fish = Total fish - Fish with red stripes
= 66 - 22
= 44

Now, we need to find the number of fish with blue stripes, which is 5/11 of the remaining fish.

Number of fish with blue stripes = (5/11) * Remaining fish
= (5/11) * 44
= 20

Now, we need to find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes. We already know that 22 fish have red stripes, and 20 fish have blue stripes. However, we need to be careful not to double-count the fish that have both red and blue stripes. 

Since we don't have information about the fish that have both red and blue stripes, we will assume that there are no fish with both red and blue stripes for the sake of this problem. 

Total fish with red and blue stripes = Fish with red stripes + Fish with blue stripes
= 22 + 20
= 42

"To find out how many eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we need to calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors she initially had and then subtract the ones she used up or lost.

Amy initially had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors from the palettes.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 eyeshadow colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister stole one of the palettes, which had 4 colors, so Amy lost 4 eyeshadow colors.

Amy used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which had 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she used up 3 eyeshadow colors.

In total, Amy lost 4 + 3 = 7 eyeshadow colors.

So, Amy has 26 - 7 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to break down the information given.

Mattison's height is 60 inches. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is, so the total height of the two-story house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The first floor's floor to ceiling height is thrice as high as Mattison's height, which is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Since the total height of the two-story house is 420 inches, and the first floor's height is 180 inches, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is the same as the height of the second floor, which is 240 inches.

"To find the number of shells found by team Gogetters, we first need to determine the number of shells found by team Alphas and team The finders.

Team Alphas found 40% of the total 700 shells. To find 40% of 700, we multiply 700 by 0.4:
700 * 0.4 = 280 shells found by team Alphas.

The remaining shells are 700 - 280 = 420 shells. Team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells. To find 60% of 420, we multiply 420 by 0.6:
420 * 0.6 = 252 shells found by team The finders.

Now, we subtract the shells found by team Alphas and team The finders from the total to find the number of shells found by team Gogetters:
700 - 280 - 252 = 168 shells found by team Gogetters.

The final answer is: 168"
"To find the total amount of exercise needed for all 4 dogs, we can multiply the average exercise per dog by the number of dogs. 

Average exercise per dog = 3 miles
Number of dogs = 4

Total exercise needed = Average exercise per dog * Number of dogs
Total exercise needed = 3 * 4
Total exercise needed = 12 miles

Now, we know the total exercise needed for all 4 dogs and the exercise needed for the first 3 dogs. 

First dog's exercise = 1 mile
Second dog's exercise = 4 miles
Third dog's exercise = 3 miles

Total exercise for the first 3 dogs = First dog's exercise + Second dog's exercise + Third dog's exercise
Total exercise for the first 3 dogs = 1 + 4 + 3
Total exercise for the first 3 dogs = 8 miles

To find the exercise needed for the last dog, we subtract the total exercise for the first 3 dogs from the total exercise needed for all 4 dogs.

Exercise needed for the last dog = Total exercise needed - Total exercise for the first 3 dogs
Exercise needed for the last dog = 12 - 8
Exercise needed for the last dog = 4 miles

60% of $100,000 = 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000

To find the amount of money John had leftover after paying debt, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the amount borrowed.

$100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To find the total weight of the tunas caught, we need to add the weights of the three tunas. 

Weight of the first tuna = 56 kg
Weight of the second tuna = 46 kg
Weight of the last tuna = 26 kg

Total weight of the tunas = 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kg

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we can multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Total weight of the tunas * Cost per kilogram
Total earnings = 128 kg * $0.50/kg
Total earnings = $64

The final answer is: $64"
"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first find the selling price of the magazines. 

The cost price of the magazines is $72. Trinity sells the magazines at 11/8 of the price she bought them. 

Let's find the selling price: 
Selling price = (11/8) * Cost price
Selling price = (11/8) * 72
Selling price = 11 * 9
Selling price = 99

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:
Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

The final answer is: $27"
"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed by each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed by the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed by the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total amount of water removed by the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, we add the total amount of water removed by each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The final answer is: 29"
"To find out how many balloons were thrown, we need to first find the total number of balloons Jolene and her friends had initially. 

They filled up 10 packs of balloons with 30 balloons per pack, so the total number of balloons is 10 * 30 = 300.

Since 12 balloons were left by the end of the afternoon, we subtract these from the total to find the number of balloons thrown: 300 - 12 = 288.

The final answer is: 288"
"To find the total amount of the second medicine, we need to calculate 3 times the amount of the first medicine. 

The first medicine is 14 mL, so 3 times that amount is 3 * 14 = 42 mL.

Now, we need to find the total amount of both medicines in one dose. The first medicine is 14 mL and the second medicine is 42 mL, so the total amount in one dose is 14 + 42 = 56 mL.

To find the total amount in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8. 

56 mL * 8 = 448 mL.

The final answer is: 448"
"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we first need to find the capacity of John's school. 

Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class has 120 students, we can find the capacity of one of John's classes by multiplying 120 by 1/8.

Capacity of one of John's classes = 120 * (1/8) = 15 students

Since John has two classes, we multiply the capacity of one class by 2 to find the total capacity of John's school.

Capacity of John's school = 15 * 2 = 30 students

Now, we add the capacity of Ali's school (which is 120 students) to the capacity of John's school to find the combined capacity of both schools.

Combined capacity = 120 + 30 = 150

The final answer is: 150"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total interest Stephen owes his sister. 

First, we need to find the total interest he owes. The interest is 2% of the initial amount borrowed, which is $300. 

Interest = 2% of $300 = 0.02 * $300 = $6

Now, we know that Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months. So, the total amount he pays in the first 11 months is:

Total paid in 11 months = $25 * 11 = $275

Since Stephen borrowed $300 and paid $275 in the first 11 months, the remaining amount he owes is:

Remaining amount = $300 - $275 = $25

However, this remaining amount includes the principal and the interest. We already calculated the interest as $6. So, the interest remaining after 11 months is:

Interest remaining = $6

Now, in the twelfth month, Stephen will pay the remaining principal and the interest. The remaining principal is $25, and the interest remaining is $6. 

Total paid in the twelfth month = $25 (principal) + $6 (interest) = $31

The final answer is: $31"
"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we first need to determine the total number of diaper changes required for both children. Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and there are 2 children, the total number of diaper changes is 2 * 5 = 10.

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, we need to find half of the total number of diaper changes. Half of 10 is 10 / 2 = 5.

Therefore, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day. 

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total volume of the jar, we need to calculate the area of the base and multiply it by the height. The base is a square with a side length of 6 inches, so the area is 6 * 6 = 36 square inches. Multiplying this by the height of 15 inches gives us a volume of 36 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, we need to find 80% of the total volume to get the effective volume. This is 0.8 * 540 = 432 cubic inches.

Each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, so we can divide the effective volume by the volume of a single jelly bean to get the total number of jelly beans: 432 / 0.15 = 2880.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3: 2880 * 0.3 = 864.

However, we are given that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find how far off Tim's guess was, we need to find the difference between his estimated number of red jelly beans and the true number. 

To estimate the number of red jelly beans, we need to know the total number of jelly beans first. Since we know the true number of red jelly beans and the percentage of red jelly beans, we can find the total number of jelly beans by dividing the true number of red jelly beans by 0.3: 900 / 0.3 = 3000.

Now we can find the estimated number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3: 3000 * 0.3 = 900.

Since the estimated number of red jelly beans is equal to the true number of red jelly beans, Tim's guess was not off at all.

The final answer is: $0$"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the bus had 20 people.

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first stop, 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered at the second stop. So, the total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the remaining spaces, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost of visits for the first 5 years and the cost of visits for the next 3 years.

For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit is $2. Since Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, the annual cost is 3 * $2 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 5 * $6 = $30.

The cost of one visit increases by 150% after 5 years. A 150% increase means the new cost is 2.5 times the original cost. So, the new cost of one visit is $2 * 2.5 = $5. The annual cost for the next 3 years is 3 * $5 = $15. For 3 years, the total cost is 3 * $15 = $45.

The total cost for all 8 years is the sum of the cost for the first 5 years and the cost for the next 3 years: $30 + $45 = $75.

The final numerical answer is: $75"
"To find the total number of students who will try the escape room, we need to multiply the number of students in each grade by the number of grades. 

There are 4 grades (4-7), and 10 students in each grade. 

Total students = 4 * 10 = 40

Since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we need to divide the total number of students by 8 to find the number of groups.

Number of groups = Total students / 8 = 40 / 8 = 5

Since each group uses their full 45 minutes, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is the number of groups multiplied by the time per group.

Total time = Number of groups * Time per group = 5 * 45 = 225 minutes

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the total amount Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the cost of the tables and the cost of the roof frames separately and then add them together.

The cost of the tables is 4 tables * $20 per table = $80.
The cost of the roof frames is 2 frames * $10 per frame = $20.

Now, we add the cost of the tables and the cost of the roof frames together: $80 + $20 = $100.

The final numerical answer is: $100"
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length can be expressed as 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet, we can find the length of the longer piece by multiplying x by 4:

4x = 4(8) = 32

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound to find the total pounds of meat needed.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Now that we know Aiden needs 5 pounds of ground beef, we can find out how much seasoning he needs. He adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat.

Total pounds of meat needed = 5
Seasoning per pound = 2 tablespoons

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat needed * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2
Total seasoning needed = 10

"To find the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the width of one window by the number of windows. 

Width of one window = 35 inches
Number of windows = 5

Total width of windows = Width of one window * Number of windows
Total width of windows = 35 * 5
Total width of windows = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the total width by 2.

Fabric needed = 2 * Total width of windows
Fabric needed = 2 * 175
Fabric needed = 350 inches

"To find the total inches of rain on Tuesday, we first need to determine how much rain fell on Monday, which is given as 2 inches. 

Next, we need to calculate the amount of rain expected on Tuesday, which is 1 more inch than twice the amount of rain on Monday. 

Twice the amount of rain on Monday is 2 * 2 = 4 inches. 

Adding 1 more inch to this gives us 4 + 1 = 5 inches.

So, the total inches of rain expected on Tuesday is 5 inches.

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes as C and the number of brownies as B. We are given that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, so we can write this as:

B = 3C - 2

We also know that each person gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. Therefore, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

Since the total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, we can write:

C + B = 10

Substituting the expression for B from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

C + (3C - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:

4C - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:

4C = 12

Divide both sides by 4:

C = 3

"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure. 

The original price of the manicure is $35 and the pedicure is $40. The discount is 20% off the total price of both manicure and pedicure. 

First, we need to find the total price of both manicure and pedicure: 
Total price = $35 + $40 = $75

Now, we need to find 20% of $75 to calculate the discount:
Discount = 20% of $75 = 0.20 * $75 = $15

Now, we subtract the discount from the total price to get the discounted price:
Discounted price = Total price - Discount = $75 - $15 = $60

Next, we need to calculate the cost of nail art for her fingers. Since there are 10 fingers, the cost of nail art is:
Nail art cost = $3 * 10 = $30

Now, we add the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of nail art to get the total cost:
Total cost = Discounted price + Nail art cost = $60 + $30 = $90

The first 3 magazines send 12 issues a year, so the total from these magazines is 3 * 12 = 36 issues.

The second magazine sends 6 issues a year.

The third magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, which is 4 * 6 = 24 issues.

Now, we add the total issues from all magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 issues.

The final answer is: 66"
"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that Samantha has 27 paintings and she has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. 

Let's denote the number of paintings Shelley has as S. Since Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, we can write an equation:

Samantha's paintings = Shelley's paintings - 12
27 = S - 12

To find the number of paintings Shelley has, we can add 12 to both sides of the equation:

S = 27 + 12
S = 39

Now that we know Shelley has 39 paintings, we can use the information that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as K. We can write another equation:

Shelley's paintings = Kim's paintings + 8
39 = K + 8

To find the number of paintings Kim has, we can subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

K = 39 - 8
K = 31

"To find the price of the toy after the discount in January, we need to follow the given changes in price.

Initially, the price of the toy is $40.

In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we multiply the initial price by 1.8 (which is 100% + 80% = 180% or 1 + 0.8 = 1.8).

Price in December = $40 * 1.8 = $72

In January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we multiply the price in December by 0.5 (which is 100% - 50% = 50% or 1 - 0.5 = 0.5).

Price in January = $72 * 0.5 = $36

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the total amount from the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons separately and then add them together.

For the standard rate lessons, Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 per hour. So, the total amount from standard rate lessons is 4 * $80 = $320.

For the reduced rate lessons, Charlie has 2 lessons at a 25% discount. The reduced rate is 75% of the standard rate, which is 0.75 * $80 = $60 per hour. So, the total amount from reduced rate lessons is 2 * $60 = $120.

Now, we add the total amount from standard rate lessons and reduced rate lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day: $320 + $120 = $440.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pomelos Eve gave away. Let's denote the number of pomelos Eve gave away as x.

We know that after giving away x pomelos, Eve is left with 1/4 of the original 20 pomelos. This means that the number of pomelos Eve has left is 20 * 1/4 = 5.

Since Eve gave away x pomelos, the number of pomelos she has left is the original number of pomelos minus the number she gave away: 20 - x = 5.

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation: -x = -15.

Multiplying both sides by -1, we get x = 15.

So, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

"To find the number of apples Walter ate, we first need to find the number of apples remaining after he ate 2/5 of them. 

Walter bought 60 apples and ate 2/5 of them. 
2/5 of 60 is (2/5) * 60 = 24 apples.

So, the number of apples remaining after Walter ate 2/5 of them is 60 - 24 = 36 apples.

Walter then gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. 
25% of 36 is (25/100) * 36 = 9 apples.

So, the number of apples remaining after Walter gave his sister 9 apples is 36 - 9 = 27 apples.

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. 
The total amount of money Walter received is 27 * 3 = $81.

We can write this as an equation: 9 = (3/4)x

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4/3 to isolate 'x'. 

x = 9 * (4/3)
x = 12

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

"To find the distance covered by Michael in 3 days, we need to calculate the total distance he travels in that time. 

First, we need to find the total hours in 3 days. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3 days is 3 * 24 = 72 hours.

Now, we can multiply the average speed by the total hours to find the total distance traveled: 
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hr
Distance = 3600 km

Now, we can find the percentage of the distance covered by dividing the distance traveled by the total distance and multiplying by 100:
Percentage = (Distance traveled / Total distance) * 100
Percentage = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage = 0.6 * 100
Percentage = 60%

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.
2. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass, so he used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.
3. The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.
4. The remaining grapes are used by their mother to make pies. Since each pie requires 12 grapes, the number of pies she can make is the total number of grapes remaining divided by 12.
5. Let's denote the initial number of grapes as x. The number of grapes remaining after Madeline and her brother used their share is x - 36.
6. Since their mother used the remaining grapes to make pies, the number of pies she made is (x - 36) / 12.
7. We are told that their mother made 4 pies, so we can set up the equation (x - 36) / 12 = 4.
8. To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by 12 to get x - 36 = 48.
9. Adding 36 to both sides of the equation gives us x = 84.

"To find the total cost of making macaroni and cheese, we need to calculate the cost of the pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese.

The cost of the pasta is $1.00 per box. Since Bud makes it once a week, he buys 1 box per week. There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total cost of pasta in a year is 1 * 52 = $52.

The cost of cheddar cheese is $3.00. Since Bud makes it once a week, the total cost of cheddar cheese in a year is 3 * 52 = $156.

The cost of gruyere cheese is twice the cost of cheddar cheese, which is 2 * 3 = $6.00. Since Bud makes it once a week, the total cost of gruyere cheese in a year is 6 * 52 = $312.

The total cost of making macaroni and cheese in a year is the sum of the costs of pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese: 52 + 156 + 312 = $520.

"To find the total number of minutes the custodian works in a day, we multiply the number of hours they work by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes/day

The total number of classrooms is 80, and it takes them 15 minutes per classroom. So, the total time spent cleaning classrooms is:

80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we divide the time spent cleaning by the total time worked in a day and multiply by 100.

(1200 minutes / 480 minutes) * 100 = 250%

The custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning classrooms, which is equivalent to 2.5 times their workday.

"To solve this problem, let's first determine the capacity of each shelf. 

Let's denote the capacity of a middle shelf as M. Since the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, its capacity is 2M. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so its capacity is 2M - 5.

We know that each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books. Therefore, M = 10. 

Now, we can calculate the capacity of the bottom and top shelves:
- Bottom shelf: 2M = 2 * 10 = 20
- Top shelf: 2M - 5 = 2 * 10 - 5 = 15

The total capacity of one bookcase is the sum of the capacities of all its shelves: 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to find out how many bookcases are required to hold all of them. 

To do this, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase: 110 / 55 = 2.

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"To find Rose's profit, we first need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The cost of 5 dozens of eggs is 5 * $2.40 = $12.

Since 1 dozen has 12 eggs, 5 dozens have 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

Rose will sell each egg for $1/3, so the total revenue will be 60 * ($1/3) = $20.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $20 - $12 = $8.

"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first calculate the total cost of the bag after the discount and then divide it by the number of sticks.

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and there's a $3.00 discount. So, the discounted price is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

Since the price is in dollars, we need to convert it to cents for consistency. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so the discounted price in cents is $15.00 * 100 = 1500 cents.

Now, we divide the total cost in cents by the number of sticks to find the cost per stick: 1500 cents / 30 sticks = 50 cents per stick.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B. We are given that B = 5S - 4. We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so S + B = 116.

We can substitute the expression for B into the second equation: S + (5S - 4) = 116. Combining like terms, we get 6S - 4 = 116. Adding 4 to both sides, we get 6S = 120. Dividing both sides by 6, we get S = 20.

Now that we know S, we can find B by substituting S into the equation B = 5S - 4: B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

The final answer is: 96"
"To find the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years, we need to calculate the total number of games she has played and then multiply it by her score per game.

Ara has been playing 40 games every year for 4 years. So, the total number of games she has played is:
40 games/year * 4 years = 160 games

Since her score for every game is 21 points, we can multiply the total number of games by her score per game to find the total points:
160 games * 21 points/game = 3360 points

The final answer is: 3360"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Brendan initially had 10 marbles.
2. He dropped half of them, so he had 10 / 2 = 5 marbles left.
3. He found 3 more marbles, so now he had 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.
4. However, one of the marbles he picked up was actually a bead, so he removed it from the count. This leaves him with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know that for every 2 customers that come into the car dealership, 1 will buy a car. This means that for every 2 customers, Jason will sell 1 car. 

Since Jason needs to sell 15 cars, he will need 15 * 2 = 30 customers to come into the car dealership.

Next, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, Jason gets 1 customer to come into the car dealership. This means that for every 25 calls, he will get 1 customer. 

To get 30 customers, Jason will need 30 * 25 = 750 telephone calls.

The final answer is: 750"
"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the family, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Next, let's calculate the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of 8 rooms is 4 rooms. So, 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, which is 4 * 4 = 16 small candles. The other 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each, which is 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles. 

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Now, we add the number of flashlights and the number of candles together: 4 flashlights + 36 candles = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many chips each person gets, we need to first find the total number of chips Mitchell bought. Since he bought two bags of chips with 55 chips each, we multiply the number of bags by the number of chips in each bag.

Total chips = 2 bags * 55 chips/bag = 110 chips

Since there are 5 family members, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of family members to find out how many chips each person gets.

Chips per person = Total chips / Number of family members
= 110 chips / 5
= 22 chips

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to calculate the time taken for each side and add them up.

The first side takes 5 minutes.
The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 2 * 5 = 10 minutes each.
The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time taken for all sides:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

The total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to add the number of robots, helmets, and footballs together: 10 (robots) + 20 (helmets) + 40 (footballs) = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the number of calls Tim deals with in a day, we need to divide the total hours he spends at work by the time it takes to deal with a call. 

First, we convert the time it takes to deal with a call from minutes to hours: 15 minutes = 15/60 = 0.25 hours.

Now, we divide the total hours Tim spends at work by the time it takes to deal with a call: 6 hours / 0.25 hours = 24 calls per day.

To find the total number of calls he deals with in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls he deals with in a day by the number of days: 24 calls/day * 5 days = 120 calls.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total time it takes for Phineas to cover the distance on land and in water. 

Since Phineas is 200 yards away from home, and half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, we can calculate the distance for each part as follows:

Distance on land = 200 yards / 2 = 100 yards
Distance in water = 200 yards / 2 = 100 yards

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for Phineas to cover each part of the distance:

Time on land = Distance on land / Speed on land = 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes
Time in water = Distance in water / Speed in water = 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes

Since Phineas needs to cover both parts of the distance, we add the time it takes for each part:

Total time = Time on land + Time in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

"To find the total cost of the phone plan, we need to determine the cost of the additional phones and add it to the cost of the main phone.

Let's assume the cost of each additional phone is x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We know that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

The total cost of the phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones:

Total cost = 20 + 40
Total cost = 60

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in a day and then multiply it by the number of days in June.

Since Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day, and 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can calculate the total number of doughnuts he makes in a day as follows:

10 dozen * 12 doughnuts/dozen = 120 doughnuts/day

Since Derrick sells all the doughnuts, we can assume he sells 120 doughnuts every day.

June has 30 days. So, the total number of doughnuts Derrick sells in June is:

120 doughnuts/day * 30 days = 3600 doughnuts

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money Derrick makes in June by multiplying the total number of doughnuts sold by the price per doughnut:

3600 doughnuts * $2/doughnut = $7200

The final answer is: $7200"

"To find the time it takes for John to speak 10 pages, we first need to calculate his new speaking speed in words per minute (WPM) after training.

His original speed is 150 WPM. After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so we multiply his original speed by 2.5:

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Now, we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so:

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words/page = 4500 words

To find the time it takes to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM, we divide the total number of words by the new speed:

Time = Total words / New speed
Time = 4500 words / 375 WPM
Time = 12 minutes

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the total number of people he saw on the first three days and add it to the total number of people he saw on the remaining days.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the number of people on the second day is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day, so the number of people on the third day is 2 * 70 = 140.

The total number of people on the first three days is 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, the total number of people he saw on the remaining days is 60 * 4 = 240.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 260 + 240 = 500.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of kernels popped in each 30-second interval and then add them up.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount popped, so 3 * 20 = 60 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, four times the initial popping rate, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 0.5 * 80 = 40 kernels popped.

Now, we need to add up the kernels popped in each interval: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels.

However, we also need to account for the kernels that popped from the residual heat. A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat, which is 0.25 * 40 = 10 kernels.

So, the total number of kernels that popped is 200 + 10 = 210.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of lemonade Tim needs to make, including the extra gallon for Allen. 

First, we know that Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party, and an extra gallon for Allen. So, the total amount of lemonade is 4 + 1 = 5 gallons.

Since each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, and Tim needs 5 gallons, he will need 5 cups of lemon juice.

We are given that 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice. To find out how many lemons are needed for 5 cups of juice, we can set up a proportion:

6 lemons / 1 cup = x lemons / 5 cups

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

6 * 5 = 1 * x
30 = x

So, Tim will need 30 lemons.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we need to calculate the daily consumption of both breeds and then multiply it by 7.

The German Shepherds consume 5 kilograms each per day, and there are 3 of them. So, the total consumption of German Shepherds per day is 3 * 5 = 15 kilograms.

The Bulldogs consume 3 kilograms each per day, and there are 2 of them. So, the total consumption of Bulldogs per day is 2 * 3 = 6 kilograms.

The total daily consumption of dog food is the sum of the consumption of both breeds: 15 + 6 = 21 kilograms.

To find the total consumption in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 21 * 7 = 147 kilograms.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by Elvis in both directions and then find the remaining distance from his house.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the west direction. Distance = Speed * Time. Since Elvis traveled for 5 hours at 18mph, the distance traveled in the west direction is:

Distance = 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles

Now, Elvis turns around and travels east for 8 hours at the same speed of 18mph. The distance traveled in the east direction is:

Distance = 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles in the west direction and 144 miles in the east direction, the net distance from his house is the difference between the two distances:

Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

The final answer is: 54"
"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and subtract it from the initial value.

Initial value of the boat = $9000

Depreciation in the first year = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after the first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Depreciation in the second year = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after the second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Depreciation in the third year = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after the third year = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The final value of the boat after three years is $3528."
"To find the number of pink candies, we first need to determine the number of orange and yellow candies.

The total age of the 2 brothers is 12 + 24 = 36 years.

The total age of all siblings is the sum of the total age of the brothers and the total age of the sisters, which is 48 + 36 = 84 years.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity separately and then add them together.

Meditation time per day: 15 minutes (morning) + 15 minutes (night) = 30 minutes
Since Charisma meditates 7 days a week, the total meditation time per week is: 30 minutes/day * 7 days/week = 210 minutes/week

Yoga time per day: 1 hour = 60 minutes
Since Charisma practices yoga 5 days a week, the total yoga time per week is: 60 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 300 minutes/week

Total time spent on meditation and yoga per week: 210 minutes/week (meditation) + 300 minutes/week (yoga) = 510 minutes/week

In 4 weeks, the total time spent on meditation and yoga is: 510 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 2040 minutes

The final answer is: 2040"
"To find the total square feet of fabric used, we need to calculate the total area of fabric from each type of shirt and then add them together.

The area of fabric from small shirts: 11 small shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet
The area of fabric from medium shirts: 8 medium shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet
The area of fabric from large shirts: 6 large shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet

Now, we add the areas together: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet

"To find the total number of seeds, we first need to determine the number of seeds in a small sunflower and a large sunflower.

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower as follows:
3 dozen * 12 seeds/dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 seeds

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find the number of seeds in a large sunflower, we need to calculate 50% of the seeds in a small sunflower and add it to the number of seeds in a small sunflower:
50% of 36 seeds = 0.5 * 36 = 18 seeds
Number of seeds in a large sunflower = 36 seeds + 18 seeds = 54 seeds

Now, we can find the total number of seeds by adding the number of seeds in a small sunflower and a large sunflower:
Total seeds = 36 seeds + 54 seeds = 90 seeds

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many pens Sarah has, we first need to determine how many pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we can calculate Timothy's pens as follows:

Timothy's pens = 3 * George's pens
Timothy's pens = 3 * 18
Timothy's pens = 54

Now that we know Timothy has 54 pens, we can find out how many pens Sarah has. Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we can calculate Sarah's pens as follows:

Sarah's pens = 1/2 * Timothy's pens
Sarah's pens = 1/2 * 54
Sarah's pens = 27

The final answer is: 27"

"To find the total amount of money the company will receive, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks and then multiply it by the price per bar.

First, let's find the number of days in two weeks: 2 weeks * 7 days/week = 14 days.

Since the company produces 5000 bars per day, the total number of bars produced in 14 days is: 5000 bars/day * 14 days = 70,000 bars.

Now, let's find the total amount of money the company will receive by selling these bars: 70,000 bars * $2/bar = $140,000.

The final answer is: $140,000."
"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

For the T-shirts, Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a buy one get one 50% off deal. This means that the price of one T-shirt is 100% and the price of the other T-shirt is 50% of the original price. 

The original price of each T-shirt is $8. So, the price of the first T-shirt is $8 and the price of the second T-shirt is 50% of $8, which is 0.5 * $8 = $4. 

The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

For the shoes, the original price is $40 and there is a 40% discount. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: 0.4 * $40 = $16. 

The discounted price of the shoes is the original price minus the discount amount: $40 - $16 = $24.

The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is the cost of the T-shirts plus the cost of the shoes: $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find out how much money Ryan has, we need to calculate his total earnings from doing chores and subtract the cost of the ice cream cones.

Ryan earns $6 each week for 3 weeks, so his total earnings are 6 * 3 = $18.

He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each, so the total cost of ice cream cones is 4 * 1.25 = $5.

Now, let's subtract the cost of ice cream cones from his total earnings: 18 - 5 = $13.

The cost of a movie ticket is $6.50. To find out how many tickets Ryan can buy, we divide his remaining money by the cost of a ticket: 13 / 6.50 = 2.

Total cost for Ellen = $100 + $5 = $105

Lani's purchases:
- A pair of sunglasses for $30
- Two bathrobes at $100 each = 2 x $100 = $200
Total cost for Lani = $30 + $200 = $230

Total amount spent by both Ellen and Lani = Total cost for Ellen + Total cost for Lani
= $105 + $230
= $335

The final answer is: $335"
"To find the profit, we first need to calculate the cost of making one jar of the mixture and then multiply it by the number of jars sold.

The cost of making one jar of the mixture is the sum of the costs of the ingredients:
- Passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6 per pound = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8 per pound = $12
- Honey: 2 pounds * $10 per pound = $20
Total cost per jar = $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

The profit per jar is the selling price minus the cost per jar:
Profit per jar = $50 - $44 = $6

To find the total profit from selling 10 jars, we multiply the profit per jar by the number of jars:
Total profit = $6 * 10 = $60

The final answer is: $60"
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add them together.

A quarter is worth $0.25, so 32 quarters are worth 32 x $0.25 = $8.

A dime is worth $0.10, so 95 dimes are worth 95 x $0.10 = $9.50.

A nickel is worth $0.05, so 120 nickels are worth 120 x $0.05 = $6.

A penny is worth $0.01, so 750 pennies are worth 750 x $0.01 = $7.50.

Now, let's add the values together: $8 + $9.50 + $6 + $7.50 = $30.50.

The total dollar amount in the jar is $30.50.

"To find out how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days he is open and then multiply that by the number of cars he services per day and his hourly wage.

Josh is open every day except Sunday and Wednesday, so he is open 5 days a week. In 2 weeks, he will be open for 5 days/week * 2 weeks = 10 days.

Since Josh services 3 cars a day, in 10 days, he will service 3 cars/day * 10 days = 30 cars.

Josh gets paid $4 per car, so in 10 days, he will make 30 cars * $4/car = $120.

Initially, Randy has 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. 

1. He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. 
   - Oatmeal cookies: 9 - 1 = 8
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 4 - 1 = 3
   - Sugar cookies: 5 - 1 = 4

2. He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch.
   - Oatmeal cookies: 8 - 2 = 6
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 3 (no change)
   - Sugar cookies: 4 (no change)

3. He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends.
   - Oatmeal cookies: 6 (no change)

"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the amount he would get for the first half of the collection and the second half separately, and then add them together.

Since Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, we can divide them into two equal halves: 6 toy soldiers for the first half and 6 toy soldiers for the second half.

For the first half, Matthew would get 6 toy soldiers * $5 per toy = $30.

For the second half, Matthew would get 6 toy soldiers * $7 per toy = $42.

To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we add the amounts from the first and second halves: $30 + $42 = $72.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of holes dug by the dog and then determine how many days it takes Nate to fill them in.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is 6 * 14 = 84.

Each day, Nate fills in 9 holes, but the dog digs 6 new ones at night. So, the net number of holes filled in each day is 9 - 6 = 3.

To find the number of days it takes to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled in each day: 84 / 3 = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the number of weeks by dividing the number of days by 7: 28 / 7 = 4.

"Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P. We are given the following information:

1. T = 16 (initially requested)
2. P = 14 (initially requested)
3. Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested: T = 16 / 2 = 8
4. Igor gathered two more Petri dishes than requested: P = 14 + 2 = 16
5. The total number of items Igor had is 29: T + B + P = 29

Substituting the values of T and P from steps 3 and 4 into the equation from step 5, we get:

8 + B + 16 = 29

Combine like terms:

24 + B = 29

Subtract 24 from both sides:

B = 5

However, we know that Igor initially picked up the correct number of beakers, which is 7. Since he lost some beakers, the number of beakers he had left is 5. To find the number of beakers he lost, we subtract the number of beakers he had left from the initial number of beakers:

Beakers lost = 7 - 5 = 2

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws needed for the tables and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws, so each table needs 4 * 2 = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is 8 * 4 = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, so to find out how many he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, so if Vanessa runs at a speed of V miles per minute, Aaron runs at a speed of 2V miles per minute.
2. Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, so if Aaron runs 4 miles, Vanessa runs 2 * 4 = 8 miles.
3. Since Aaron runs 4 miles in 16 minutes, his speed is 4 miles / 16 minutes = 0.25 miles per minute.
4. Since Aaron's speed is 2V, we can set up the equation 2V = 0.25 miles per minute.
5. Solving for V, we get V = 0.25 / 2 = 0.125 miles per minute.
6. Since Vanessa runs 8 miles at a speed of 0.125 miles per minute, the time it takes her to complete her part of the race is 8 miles / 0.125 miles per minute = 64 minutes.

"To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first need to determine the total amount of line required for the existing dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, we multiply 200 by 3.

200 * 3 = 600

This means he needs 600 feet of line for the existing dock. Since he already has 6 feet of new line, we need to subtract that from the total amount needed.

600 - 6 = 594

So, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total.

"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate their daily revenue and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

First, let's calculate the daily revenue. They get 6 reservations a night, and each reservation includes 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine. 

Daily revenue = (6 reservations * 2 meals * $5) + (6 reservations * $5)
Daily revenue = (6 * 2 * $5) + (6 * $5)
Daily revenue = $60 + $30
Daily revenue = $90

Since they are open 2 days a week, we multiply the daily revenue by 2.

Weekly revenue = $90 * 2
Weekly revenue = $180

"To find the cost price of each watermelon, we first need to find the total cost of the watermelons. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price of each watermelon is:

Cost price of 50 watermelons = $80
Cost price of 1 watermelon = $80 / 50
Cost price of 1 watermelon = $1.60

Now, we know the cost price of each watermelon and the profit percentage. The profit percentage is 25%, which means the selling price is 125% of the cost price (100% + 25% profit). 

Selling price of 1 watermelon = 1.25 * Cost price of 1 watermelon
Selling price of 1 watermelon = 1.25 * $1.60
Selling price of 1 watermelon = $2

"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then determine the age of John's youngest son.

First, let's find James' current age. We know that James is twice as old as Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. This means that Dora's current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

We also know that James is 9 years older than John, since John was 19 when James was born. Therefore, John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son's current age is 37 - 32 = 5 years.

In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount and then add the labor cost.

The original cost of the radiator is $400. Mark gets it for 80% off, which means he pays 20% of the original cost. 

20% of $400 is 0.2 * 400 = $80.

So, Mark pays $80 for the radiator.

The mechanic charges $50 an hour and works for 3 hours, so the labor cost is 50 * 3 = $150.

The total cost is the cost of the radiator plus the labor cost: $80 + $150 = $230.

The final answer is: $230"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation:

C + W = 20

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, so we can write the equation:

2C + 4W = 70

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by 2 to get:

2C + 2W = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate C:

(2C + 4W) - (2C + 2W) = 70 - 40
2W = 30

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

W = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of chickens:

C + 15 = 20
C = 5

So, there are 5 chickens on the farm.
