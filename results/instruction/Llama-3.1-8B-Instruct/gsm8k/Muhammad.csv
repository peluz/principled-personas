"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first determine how many eggs she has left after eating and baking. 

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and bakes 4 for muffins, so she uses a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. 

Now, let's subtract the number of eggs she uses from the total number of eggs she lays: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

Janet sells these 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. To find out how much she makes, we multiply the number of eggs she sells by the price per egg: 9 * 2 = 18.

So, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

"To find the total number of bolts needed for the robe, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, we can calculate the white fiber as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts (blue fiber) / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we add the blue fiber and white fiber to get the total number of bolts:

Total bolts = 2 bolts (blue fiber) + 1 bolt (white fiber) = 3 bolts

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit Josh made, we first need to determine the total value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

Let's denote the increased value as x. We can set up the equation: 
80,000 + 50,000 = x + 1.5x (since 150% is the same as multiplying by 1.5)

Combine like terms: 
130,000 = 2.5x

Now, divide both sides by 2.5 to solve for x: 
x = 130,000 / 2.5
x = 52,000

So, the total value of the house after the repairs is $52,000. 

To find the profit, we subtract the original cost of the house from the new value: 
Profit = New Value - Original Cost
Profit = 52,000 - 80,000
Profit = -28,000

However, since Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, we need to add that to the profit to get the total profit: 
Total Profit = Profit + Repairs
Total Profit = -28,000 + 50,000
Total Profit = 22,000

The final answer is: $22,000"
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he has in a week.

Since James runs 3 sprints in one session, and each sprint is 60 meters, the total meters he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James runs 3 sessions a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to determine the total number of cups of feed she gives her chickens in a day. 

In the morning, she gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives her chickens 25 cups of feed. So, the total number of cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of feed per day, and she has 20 chickens, the total number of cups of feed needed per day is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

Now, we subtract the total number of cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total number of cups of feed needed per day to find out how many cups of feed she needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day. 

60 - 40 = 20 cups.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 
The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * $3 = $1.8. 
We can see that the cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of the previous glass. 

The sequence of the cost of the glasses is: $5, $3, $1.8, $1.08, $0.64, $0.384, $0.2304, $0.13824, $0.082944, $0.0497664, $0.02986584, $0.017929504, $0.010757904, $0.006454144, $0.0038272864, $0.002306377184, $0.0013737264904.

To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of all the glasses. 
Total cost = $5 + $3 + $1.8 + $1.08 + $0.64 + $0.384 + $0.2304 + $0.13824 + $0.082944 + $0.0497664 + $0.02986584 + $0.017929504 + $0.010757904 + $0.006454144 + $0.0038272864 + $0.002306377184 + $0.0013737264904
Total cost ≈ $23.999999999999996

However, we can simplify this process by using a formula. The cost of the first glass is $5, and the cost of the second glass is 60% of $5. The cost of the third glass is 60% of the second glass, which is (0.6)^2 * $5. The cost of the fourth glass is (0.6)^3 * $5, and so on. 

The total cost can be calculated as: 
Total cost = $5 + 2 * (0.6 * $5) + 3 * (0.6^2 * $5) + 4 * (0.6^3 * $5) + ... + 16 * (0.6^15 * $5)

This is a geometric series with the first term a = $5, the common ratio r = 0.6, and the number of terms n = 16. The sum of a geometric series can be calculated as: 
S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

However, since we are multiplying each term by the term number, we need to use the formula for the sum of a geometric series with the first term multiplied by the term number: 
S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)^2

Plugging in the values, we get: 
S = $5 * (1 - 0.6^16) / (1 - 0.6)^2
S ≈ $23.999999999999996

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   Since Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

2. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   Since Charleston has 80 sheep, Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, let's add up the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:
160 (Toulouse) + 80 (Charleston) + 20 (Seattle) = 260

"To find the total time it takes Carla to download the file, we need to calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 x 200 = 80 GB. Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Next, we need to add the time it takes to install the updates, which is 20 minutes.

Now, we need to calculate the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file. 60% of 200 GB is 0.6 x 200 = 120 GB. The time it takes to download 120 GB is 120 / 2 = 60 minutes.

The total time it takes to download the file is the sum of the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file. 

Total time = 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts. 

First, let's calculate the distance John traveled on his way to the point where he turned around. Since he drove for 3 hours at 60 mph, we can use the formula distance = speed * time. 

Distance = 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles.

Now, let's calculate the distance he traveled on his way back home. He spent the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he didn't move. Then, he drove for half an hour at 30 mph. 

Distance = 30 mph * 0.5 hours = 15 miles.

After that, he drove for the remaining 2 hours at 80 mph. 

Distance = 80 mph * 2 hours = 160 miles.

Now, we need to add the distances he traveled on both legs of his trip to find the total distance from home. 

Total distance = 180 miles + 15 miles + 160 miles = 355 miles.

However, this is the total distance he traveled. Since he turned around at the point where he forgot something, we need to subtract the distance he traveled on the way to that point from the total distance to find the distance from home. 

Distance from home = Total distance - Distance to the point where he turned around
= 355 miles - 180 miles
= 175 miles.

"To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately, then add them together.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so her overtime rate is $10 * 1.2 = $12/hour. 
Her overtime earnings are:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460

"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and then add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. Then, we subtract 54 from 180 to get 126 downloads in the third month.

Now, we add the downloads from each month together: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them together.

Next, let's find the cost of the mini cupcakes: 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen will be 2 x $80 = $160.

Now, let's find the cost of the mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen will be 6 x $55 = $330.

Finally, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of planting the tree and the annual expenses, and then find the point at which the total earnings from selling lemons exceed these costs.

The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. The annual expenses are $3 for watering and feeding the tree. 

The tree grows 7 lemons per year, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. So, the total earnings from selling lemons per year is 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.

Now, let's calculate the net earnings per year by subtracting the annual expenses from the total earnings from selling lemons: $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

Since the initial cost of planting the tree is $90, we need to find the number of years it takes for the net earnings to cover this cost. We can do this by dividing the initial cost by the net earnings per year: $90 / $7.5 = 12 years.

However, this calculation assumes that the tree will start earning money immediately after the first year. Since the tree costs $90 to plant, it will take 1 year to plant the tree, and then 11 more years to cover the initial cost.

Therefore, it will take 12 years for the tree to start earning money on its own, but since the first year is the planting year, it will take 13 years in total for the tree to start earning money on its own after the initial investment.

The final answer is: 13"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume Melanie started with 'x' vacuum cleaners.

At the green house, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners, which is x/3.

At the red house, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners.

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which is (x - x/3 - 2)/2.

We know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, the total number of vacuum cleaners she sold is x - 5.

We can set up an equation based on the information:

x - (x/3) - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = x - 5

To simplify the equation, let's multiply both sides by 6 to get rid of the fractions:

6x - 2x - 12 - 3(x - x/3 - 2) = 6x - 30

Combine like terms:

4x - 12 - 3x + x + 6 = 6x - 30

Combine like terms:

2x - 6 = 6x - 30

Add 6 to both sides:

2x = 6x - 24

Subtract 6x from both sides:

-4x = -24

Divide both sides by -4:

x = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, and then subtract that from the total number of students.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20 * 0.2 = 4 students

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
16 * 0.25 = 4 students

The number of students who enrolled in jazz dance is 4, and the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance is also 4. So, the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students.

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

"To determine the maximum profit, we need to calculate the potential value of each purchase after the market fluctuation. 

For the jewelry, the value will increase by 2.5% of $5,000, which is 0.025 * $5,000 = $125. So, the new value of the jewelry will be $5,000 + $125 = $5,125.

For the electronic gadgets, the value will increase by 1.2% of $8,000, which is 0.012 * $8,000 = $96. So, the new value of the electronic gadgets will be $8,000 + $96 = $8,096.

Since the merchant is looking to maximize profit, we need to compare the potential profit from each option. 

The profit from the jewelry will be $5,125 - $5,000 = $125.

The profit from the electronic gadgets will be $8,096 - $8,000 = $96.

The maximum profit will be from the jewelry, which is $125."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered on the first day and the distance covered on the second day.

On the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance. So, each train covers 80 miles on the first day.

On the second day, they travel northward, covering 150 miles. Again, since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance. So, each train covers 150 miles on the second day.

To find the total distance covered by each train in the two days, we add the distances covered on the first and second days:

Total distance covered by each train = 80 miles (first day) + 150 miles (second day) = 230 miles

The final answer is: 230"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:

She works 35 hours a week as a teacher and gets paid $20 per hour. So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
35 hours/week * $20/hour = $700/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are:
$700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:

She works 15 hours a week as a coach and gets paid $30 per hour. So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
15 hours/week * $30/hour = $450/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are:
$450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
$35,000/year (teaching) + $22,500/year (coaching) = $57,500/year

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To find out how many eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to first calculate how many eggs she eats in a day and then multiply that by the number of days in 4 weeks.

Since Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. 

There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are 4 x 7 = 28 days.

Now, we multiply the number of eggs she eats per day by the number of days in 4 weeks: 3 eggs/day * 28 days = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks: 84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozen eggs.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much time Marissa has left to walk the remaining distance. 

She has walked 4 miles in 1 hour and 2 miles in another hour, so she has walked a total of 6 miles in 2 hours. 

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles, and she has already walked 6 miles, so she has 12 - 6 = 6 miles left to walk.

Since she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, and the total distance is 12 miles, she needs to cover the total distance in 12 / 4 = 3 hours.

She has already walked for 2 hours, so she has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left to walk the remaining 6 miles.

To find her required speed, we divide the remaining distance by the remaining time: 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total amount of water in the orange drink, we first need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. 

Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters. 

Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the remaining one-third is non-water. So, the non-water content in the orange drink is 10 - 6.67 = 3.33 liters.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water in the pineapple drink. Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

When we add the orange and pineapple drinks together, we get a total of 24 liters. However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink. So, the actual amount of orange drink left is 10 - 1 = 9 liters.

The amount of water in the remaining orange drink is 6.67 - 1/3 * 1 = 6.67 - 0.33 = 6.34 liters.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is the sum of the water in the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink. 

Total water = 6.34 + 9 = 15.34 liters.

The final answer is: 15.34"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha.
2. Samantha is now 31 years old.
3. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old.
4. Raymond had a son at the age of 23, so the son is 25 - 23 = 2 years younger than Raymond.
5. Since the son is 2 years younger than Raymond, and Raymond is 25 years old, the son is 25 - 2 = 23 years old.
6. To find out how many years ago the son was born, we need to subtract the son's age from the current year. However, we don't know the current year, but we can find the difference in age between Samantha and the son, which is 31 - 23 = 8 years.

However, we need to find out how many years ago the son was born. Since we know the son is 23 years old and Samantha is 31, we can find the difference in their ages, which is 8 years. This is the time that has passed since Samantha was born. Since Raymond was 23 when his son was born, we need to find the time that has passed since Raymond was 23. 

Since Raymond is 25 and Samantha is 31, the time that has passed since Raymond was 23 is 25 - 23 = 2 years. However, this is the time that has passed since Raymond was 23, not the time that has passed since the son was born. 

To find the time that has passed since the son was born, we need to add the 8 years that have passed since Samantha was born to the 2 years that have passed since Raymond was 23. However, this is incorrect because the 8 years that have passed since Samantha was born is the time that has passed since the son was born plus the 2 years that have passed since Raymond was 23. 

So, the time that has passed since the son was born is 8 - 2 = 6 years.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many DVDs Billy sold, we need to calculate the total number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought a total of 3 DVDs.
The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought a total of 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs.

Now, let's add the total number of DVDs sold to the first 5 customers: 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

Since the last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, we don't need to add anything to the total.

So, Billy sold a total of 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"To find out how many centimeters shorter the candle will be, we need to calculate the total time it burns and multiply it by the rate at which it melts.

The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is a total of 4 hours.

The rate at which the candle melts is 2 centimeters per hour.

So, the total amount of melting is 4 hours * 2 centimeters/hour = 8 centimeters.

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to determine the amount of the discount and add it to the discounted price. 

First, let's find the amount of the discount: 
Discount = 25% of the original price
Let's call the original price 'x'. 
Discount = 0.25x

Since the discounted price is $19.50, we can set up the equation:
x - 0.25x = 19.50
Combine like terms:
0.75x = 19.50
Now, divide both sides by 0.75 to solve for x:
x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To find the total cost of the items Marie ordered excluding the pizza, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken meal, the milk, and the apples.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of the items excluding the pizza is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

To find the number of boxes of pizza, we need to divide the cost of the pizza by the cost of each box.

Number of boxes of pizza = $17 / $8.50 = 2.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total amount Mishka spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she buys and multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will go through 60 servings in 60 days. 

Each carton has 15 servings, so to find out how many cartons she buys, we divide the total number of servings by the number of servings per carton: 
60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Now, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton to find the total cost:
4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

So, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

First, let's find the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip. Since Henry's second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip is 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

Now, we know that Henry's first stop was after 20 miles. So, the distance from the first stop to the second stop is 45 - 20 = 25 miles.

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, which means the second pair costs 2 * 33 = $66. 

The total cost of the two pairs of heels is 33 + 66 = $99. We are also told that the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. 

Let's represent the cost of the boots as 'x'. Since the two pairs of heels cost five dollars less than the boots, we can write the equation: x - 5 = 99.

To find the cost of the boots, we need to solve for 'x'. We can do this by adding 5 to both sides of the equation: x = 99 + 5.

x = 104

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let Darrell's age be 7x and Allen's age be 11x, where x is a constant.

Since their total age is 162, we can write the equation: 
7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 
18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: 
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age: 
Allen's age = 11x = 11 * 9 = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the total number of guesses and divide it by the number of people.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.
The second person guesses 20 more than half of the first one, which is (80 / 2) + 20 = 60.
The third person guesses 25% more than the first one, which is 80 + (80 * 0.25) = 100.

Now, let's add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

There are 3 people, so we divide the total by 3 to find the average: 240 / 3 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total hours John spends taking care of dogs in a week, we need to first calculate the total hours he spends per day. 

There are 10 dogs, and each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. 

Total hours per day = Number of dogs * Hours per dog per day
Total hours per day = 10 * 0.5
Total hours per day = 5 hours

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the total hours per day by 7 to get the total hours per week.

Total hours per week = Total hours per day * 7
Total hours per week = 5 * 7
Total hours per week = 35 hours

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'. 

We know that the total number of coins is 110, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 30) = 110.

Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 110.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

Since x represents the number of silver coins, and there are 30 more gold coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"

"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes separately, then add them together.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which is 1. Then, we add this to the original 4 points to get the total points scored in the second 20 minutes: 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The total points Mike scored is 9."
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to first calculate how many yogurts he eats in 30 days and then find out the cost of those yogurts.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Since they are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry buys in 30 days. To do this, we divide the total number of yogurts he eats by 4: 60 / 4 = 15.

Now, we multiply the number of sets by the cost per set: 15 * $5.00 = $75.00.

So, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To find out how many Lego sets John has left, we first need to calculate how much money he made from selling the Lego sets. 

He sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is 13 * 15 = $195.

Next, we need to find out how much money he spent on video games. He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so the total amount of money he spent is 8 * 20 = $160.

Since he had $5 left after buying the video games, we can find out how much money he had before buying the video games by adding the money he had left to the money he spent on video games. So, he had $160 + $5 = $165 before buying the video games.

Now, we know that he made $195 from selling the Lego sets and he had $165 before buying the video games. This means that he must have spent $195 - $165 = $30 on something else before buying the video games.

However, we are not given any information about what he spent the $30 on, but we are asked to find out how many Lego sets he has left. Since he made $195 from selling the Lego sets and he spent $30, we can find out how many Lego sets he sold for $30 by dividing $30 by $15 (the price of each Lego set). 

$30 / $15 = 2 Lego sets.

So, John sold 2 Lego sets for $30. To find out how many Lego sets he has left, we need to subtract the number of Lego sets he sold from the total number of Lego sets he had initially. 

13 - 2 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"

He runs 3 hours on the first day. The other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours per day. 

So, the total hours he runs per week is 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours.

Now, we know John runs 60 miles a week and 6 hours a week. To find his speed, we divide the total miles by the total hours: 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running and walking speeds. 

Given that Dana can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, and she can skip at 3 miles per hour, we can find her running speed by multiplying her skipping speed by 2. 

Dana's running speed = 2 * 3 miles per hour = 6 miles per hour.

We are also given that Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. So, we can find her walking speed by dividing her running speed by 4.

Dana's walking speed = 6 miles per hour / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, we know that Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, in 6 hours, she will spend 2 hours running and 4 hours walking.

Distance traveled while running = Speed * Time = 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.

Distance traveled while walking = Speed * Time = 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours = 6 miles.

Total distance traveled = Distance traveled while running + Distance traveled while walking = 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone. 

When Polly holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. Since she can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, she can throw it 3 * 400 = 1200 feet with the gemstone.

The dragon's flames reach 1000 feet. To find the distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames, we subtract 1000 from the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

"To find out how many calories you can still consume, we need to subtract the calories you've already consumed from your daily target. 

Daily target: 2000 calories
Consumed calories: 1800 calories
Remaining calories: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, we need to find out how many servings you can have with 200 calories.

Remaining calories: 200
Calories per serving: 250
Number of servings: 200 / 250 = 0.8

Since there are 5 servings in a 300g bag, we need to find out how many grams you can eat with 0.8 servings.

Number of servings: 0.8
Servings per bag: 5
Fraction of the bag: 0.8 / 5 = 0.16

To find the grams, we multiply the fraction of the bag by the total weight of the bag.

Fraction of the bag: 0.16
Weight of the bag: 300g
Grams you can eat: 0.16 * 300 = 48

"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

First, let's find the total cost. Since one pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00, and Charlie makes 10 candles from one pound of beeswax, the cost per candle is $1.00. 

Now, let's find the total cost for 20 candles: 
Total cost = cost per candle * number of candles
Total cost = $1.00 * 20
Total cost = $20.00

Next, let's find the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, so the total revenue is:
Total revenue = price per candle * number of candles
Total revenue = $2.00 * 20
Total revenue = $40.00

Now, let's find the net profit:
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply it by the average time it takes to write an article (4 hours).

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 
2/5 of 5 is 2, so she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. 
Twice 7 is 14, so she wrote 14 articles on Wednesday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days:
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. To find the number of blue ties, we can divide the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost per tie:

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

Now, we know that the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. This means the cost of a red tie is 1.5 times the cost of a blue tie:

Cost of a red tie = 1.5 * Cost of a blue tie
= 1.5 * $40
= $60

To find the total amount spent on red ties, we multiply the number of red ties by the cost per red tie:

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

The total amount spent on ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

Total units = 120

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total units to determine the number of unoccupied units.

1/4 of total units = (1/4) * 120
1/4 of total units = 30

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30.

"To find the total time Tom's ship takes to travel from 1 to 4 PM and back, we need to calculate the time taken for each leg of the journey separately.

First, let's find the time taken to travel from 1 to 4 PM. Since the speed is not given for this part of the journey, we can assume it's the same as the return journey, which is 6 mph. However, the problem states that he travels at 10 miles per hour for this part. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Time = Distance / Speed
Distance = 3 miles (4 - 1 = 3 miles)
Time = 3 miles / 10 mph = 0.3 hours

Now, let's find the time taken to travel back from 4 to 1 PM. 
Distance = 3 miles (1 - 4 = -3 miles, but we take the absolute value)
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 3 miles / 6 mph = 0.5 hours

Total time = Time taken to travel from 1 to 4 PM + Time taken to travel back from 4 to 1 PM
Total time = 0.3 hours + 0.5 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much weight the comic books are removing from the bag. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and Uriah removes 30 comic books, the total weight removed by the comic books is:

30 * 1/4 = 30/4 = 7.5 pounds

Now, Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from the bag. Since the comic books are removing 7.5 pounds, the remaining weight that needs to be removed by the toys is:

15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so to find out how many toys need to be removed, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total revenue for each day, we need to calculate the revenue from truck tires and car tires separately and then add them together.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires at $60 each and 4 car tires at $40 each. 
Revenue from truck tires on Thursday = 6 * $60 = $360
Revenue from car tires on Thursday = 4 * $40 = $160
Total revenue on Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires at $40 each and no truck tires.
Revenue from car tires on Friday = 12 * $40 = $480
Total revenue on Friday = $480

To find the day with higher revenue, we compare the total revenue on Thursday and Friday. 
Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue.

Now, to find how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we subtract the revenue of the day with lower revenue from the day with higher revenue.
Difference in revenue = $520 - $480 = $40

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of kittens, we first need to determine the number of kittens each cat had. 

Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens, and since there were 7 adopted kittens, Patchy had 3 * 7 = 21 kittens.

Trixie had 12 kittens.

Now, we add the number of adopted kittens to the number of kittens from the two house cats: 7 (adopted) + 21 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 40.

The Doubtfire family now has 40 kittens."
"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we first need to determine how many lollipops are left after eating 2. 

Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2, so the remaining lollipops are 30 - 2 = 28.

Since Jean wants to put 2 lollipops in each bag, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to find out how many bags can be filled.

28 lollipops / 2 lollipops per bag = 14 bags

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate how many times he can afford the total cost of a movie outing, which is the sum of the ticket price and the popcorn price.

The total cost of a movie outing is $7 (ticket) + $7 (popcorn) = $14.

Now, let's divide the total amount of money Peter has ($42) by the cost of a movie outing ($14) to find out how many times he can go to the movies.

$42 ÷ $14 = 3

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times."
"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit, and then divide the result by the weight of each box.

First, let's calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge:

Bridge's weight limit: 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck: 3755 pounds
Remaining weight capacity: 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Now, let's divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of each box:

Weight of each box: 15 pounds
Maximum number of boxes: 1245 / 15 = 83

So, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83.

The final answer is: 83"

"To find Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to calculate the value of the pension after 30 years and then add the additional 5% of the value for the last 10 years.

First, let's calculate the total value of the pension after 30 years. Since she gets $50,000 per year for 10 years, the total value is:
$50,000 * 10 = $500,000

Now, for the next 20 years, she gets 5% of the value of the pension per year. The value of the pension after 20 years is the same as the total value calculated above, which is $500,000. 

The annual pension for the last 10 years is 5% of $500,000:
5% of $500,000 = 0.05 * $500,000 = $25,000

Now, we add the annual pension for the first 10 years and the annual pension for the last 10 years:
$50,000 + $25,000 = $75,000

The final answer is: $75,000"
"To find the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to calculate the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately and then add them together.

The streaming service charges $140 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the first half of the year consists of 6 months. 

The amount she paid for the first half of the year is 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, the company charges 10% less than the initial amount. To find the amount charged for the second half, we need to calculate 10% of $140 and subtract it from $140.

10% of $140 = 0.1 * $140 = $14
Amount charged for the second half of the year = $140 - $14 = $126

The amount she paid for the second half of the year is 6 * $126 = $756.

Now, we add the amount she paid for the first half and the second half of the year to find the total amount she paid for the streaming service by the end of the year.

Total amount = $840 + $756 = $1596

The final answer is: $1596"
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to determine the car's miles per gallon (mpg) rating. We can do this by dividing the distance traveled since the last fill-up (100 miles) by the amount of gas used (4 gallons).

mpg = distance / gas used
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know the car's mpg rating, we can find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a full tank by multiplying the tank capacity (12 gallons) by the mpg rating.

miles per tank = tank capacity * mpg
miles per tank = 12 gallons * 25 miles/gallon
miles per tank = 300 miles

"To find the total time Jim spends on TV and reading, we need to calculate the time spent in one week and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the time spent in one week:

- Time spent watching TV: 2 hours
- Time spent reading: 2 hours / 2 = 1 hour (since he reads for half as long as he watches TV)

Total time spent in one day: 2 hours (TV) + 1 hour (reading) = 3 hours

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent in one week is: 3 hours * 3 = 9 hours

Now, let's multiply the total time spent in one week by 4 to find the total time spent in 4 weeks: 9 hours * 4 = 36 hours

"To find the total number of people sent by the schools, we need to calculate the total number of students and coaches.

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players. So, the total number of students from each school is 2 teams * 5 players/team = 10 players.

Each school also has 2 coaches, one for each team. So, the total number of coaches from each school is 2 coaches.

Now, we multiply the number of students and coaches from each school by the total number of schools to find the total number of people sent by all schools.

Total number of students = 10 players/school * 4 schools = 40 players
Total number of coaches = 2 coaches/school * 4 schools = 8 coaches

"To find out how much Shiela will pay each month, we need to calculate the total cost of the cell phones first, then divide it by the number of months.

The total cost of the cell phones is 5 units * $150/unit = $750.

Since a 2% interest will be charged for each unit, the total interest for 5 units is 5 * 2% = 10% of the total cost.

The interest amount is 10% of $750 = 0.1 * $750 = $75.

So, the total amount Shiela needs to pay is the cost of the cell phones plus the interest, which is $750 + $75 = $825.

"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year. 

First, let's find out how many days are in a year. There are 365 days in a year.

The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food for the first 180 days. So, the amount of dog food eaten in the first 180 days is 1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups.

The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food for the rest of its life, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days. So, the amount of dog food eaten in the rest of the year is 2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups.

The total amount of dog food eaten in the first year is 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags of dog food used in the first year is 550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags.

"To find out how many games the team won, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of games they lost is x. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is x + 8.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, which is the sum of the games they won and the games they lost. So, we can write the equation as:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:
2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:
2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 7

Since x represents the number of games they lost, and they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we first need to calculate her salary after five years of service, and then calculate the increase for the next three years.

Initially, Sylvie's salary is $600. 

After one year, her salary will be 600 + (600 * 0.10) = 600 + 60 = $660.

After two years, her salary will be 660 + (660 * 0.10) = 660 + 66 = $726.

After three years, her salary will be 726 + (726 * 0.10) = 726 + 72.6 = $798.60.

After four years, her salary will be 798.60 + (798.60 * 0.10) = 798.60 + 79.86 = $878.46.

After five years, her salary will be 878.46 + (878.46 * 0.10) = 878.46 + 87.846 = $966.306.

Now, for the next three years, her salary will increase by 10% each year. 

After six years, her salary will be 966.306 + (966.306 * 0.10) = 966.306 + 96.6306 = $1062.9366.

"To find out how many gift bags Christina needs, we first need to calculate the number of guests who will actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, we can find the number of guests who will attend by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of invited guests.

16 (invited guests) - (1/4 of 16) = 16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply the number of guests who will attend by 0.75.

12 (guests) * 0.75 (gift bags per guest) = 9

So, Christina needs 9 gift bags. Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag.

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 60 + 120
= 180

According to the first point, the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats:
Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
= 180 - 12
= 168

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats:
Total number of pets = Number of rabbits + Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 168 + 60 + 120
= 348

The final answer is: 348"
"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls and then subtract the number of girls in the girl scout.

First, let's find the number of boys and girls. We know that 2/5 of the students are boys. 

Number of boys = (2/5) * 200 = 80

Since there are 200 students in total, the number of girls can be found by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students.

Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

Now, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = (2/3) * 120 = 80

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Number of girls not in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many hours James slept, we need to calculate 2/3 of the hours Harry slept. 

Harry slept 9 hours, so 2/3 of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6 hours.

Now, we need to find the difference between the hours Harry and James slept. 
Harry slept 9 hours and James slept 6 hours. 
So, the difference is 9 - 6 = 3 hours.

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we first need to determine how much volume of tomatoes she started with. Since the sauce made 32 ounces and it's half the volume of the tomatoes, the original volume of tomatoes must be 32 * 2 = 64 ounces.

Since each 16-ounce can contains three tomatoes, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans Freda used. To do this, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of each can: 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Since each can contains three tomatoes, we multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can: 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to first determine the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam. 

We know that 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. 

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as 'x'. Since 5 cars took an exit, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is x + 20 + 5 (the 5 cars that took an exit).

We are given that there were originally 30 cars on the motorway. Since the 5 cars that took an exit are not included in the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

Now, we can set up the equation: x + 20 + 5 = 25

Simplifying the equation, we get x + 25 = 25

Subtracting 25 from both sides, we get x = 0.

However, this doesn't make sense because it's not possible for no cars to drive through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. Let's re-examine the problem.

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we first need to determine how many plants she has initially and then subtract the number of plants she gives away.

Mary initially has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so she has 2 * 40 = 80 potted plants.

She received 18 new potted plants from the nursery, so now she has 80 + 18 = 98 potted plants.

She decides to give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges, so she gives away 40 potted plants.

To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we subtract the number of plants she gave away from the total number of plants she had: 98 - 40 = 58.

So, Mary will have 58 potted plants left.

The final answer is: 58"
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and add them up.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend, which is 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. Since the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of doorbell rings: 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175.

To find the number of 3-mile sections, we divide the total distance by the distance covered per section: 
42 miles / 3 miles per section = 14 sections

Now, we multiply the number of sections by the time it takes to cover each section:
14 sections * 10 minutes per section = 140 minutes

Now, there are 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left. 

Her mom places a third of the remaining 750 pieces, which is 750 * (1/3) = 250 pieces. 

Now, we subtract the pieces her mom placed from the remaining pieces: 750 - 250 = 500 pieces.

So, there are 500 pieces left to be placed.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to find the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The outer dimensions of the box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick. So, the inner dimensions will be (5-2) inches by (6-2) inches by (4-2) inches, which is 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches.

The formula to find the volume of a rectangular prism is length * width * height. 

So, the inner volume of one box is 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is 3 * 24 = 72 cubic inches.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 2 episodes of a 1-hour show, which is a total of 2 hours. 

On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's call the number of episodes he watched 'x'. The total time he watched on Wednesday is 30x minutes, which is equal to 0.5x hours.

On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is a total of 1.5 hours.

On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is a total of 2 hours.

The total time he watched is 7 hours. We can set up an equation to represent this:

2 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7

Combine like terms:

5.5 + 0.5x = 7

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

0.5x = 1.5

Divide both sides by 0.5:

x = 3

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as 'x'. Since Henry wants to make twice as many as he did last year, he plans to bake 2x cookies this year.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has a total of 110 cookies. This can be represented as (2x + 15) - 5 = 110.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 10 = 110.

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get 2x = 100.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 50.

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To find the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of gas without the rewards, and then subtract the cashback rewards.

The cost of gas per gallon is $3.00, and the person is buying 10 gallons. 

Total cost of gas = cost per gallon * number of gallons
Total cost of gas = $3.00 * 10
Total cost of gas = $30.00

The cashback rewards are $0.20 per gallon, and the person is buying 10 gallons.

Total cashback rewards = cashback per gallon * number of gallons
Total cashback rewards = $0.20 * 10
Total cashback rewards = $2.00

Now, we subtract the total cashback rewards from the total cost of gas to find the final cost.

Final cost = Total cost of gas - Total cashback rewards
Final cost = $30.00 - $2.00
Final cost = $28.00

The final answer is: $28.00"
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by each, we need to multiply the width by the length of each roll-up. 

Beatrice's roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 rolls long, so the total number of roll-ups she ate is 2 * 24 = 48.

Marcell's roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 rolls long, so the total number of roll-ups he ate is 3 * 14 = 42.

To find the average number of roll-ups eaten by each, we need to add the total number of roll-ups eaten by each and divide by 2. 

Total roll-ups eaten = 48 + 42 = 90
Average roll-ups eaten = 90 / 2 = 45

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to first find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rows in 64 seconds. Since it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find the time it takes her to row 10 feet by dividing 16 seconds by 2, which is 8 seconds. 

Now, we can find out how many sets of 10 feet she rows in 64 seconds by dividing 64 seconds by 8 seconds, which is 8. This means she rows 8 sets of 10 feet in 64 seconds.

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, and she rows 8 sets of 10 feet, the total water taken on is 8 * 2 = 16 liters.

From point 1, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, then Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

From point 2, we know that Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Since Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs, the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo is 300 / 50 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total cost of the lumber, we need to calculate the cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards and the 4 x 4 x 10 boards separately and then add them together.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $10 per board = $100.

The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $16 per board = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the lumber is 1.5 times the original price. 

The new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 per board.

The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 per board.

The total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $15 per board = $150.

The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $24 per board = $120.

The total revenue is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we need to first find the total parts in the ratio, which is 7 + 13 = 20. 

We know that the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons. To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar, we need to find the fraction of the total that represents the sugar, which is 7/20. 

We can multiply the total amount of sugar and water (120) by the fraction of sugar (7/20) to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used:

(7/20) * 120 = (7 * 120) / 20
= 840 / 20
= 42

The final answer is: 42"
"To find the total amount John paid, we need to calculate the cost of the shoes for all his children. 

First, we find the cost of shoes for one child: 2 pairs * $60 per pair = $120.

Then, we multiply this by the number of children: $120 * 3 = $360.

So, John paid $360 in total. 

The final answer is: $360"
"To find the number of containers that were imported on the second day, we first need to find the total number of vehicles that were already at the port. We know that there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles already at the port is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we know that the total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30. To find the number of vehicles that were added on the second day, we subtract the initial number of vehicles from the total number of vehicles: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers that were imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added on the second day by 5: 20 / 5 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Lylah's salary four years ago. 

Let's assume Lylah's salary four years ago was 'x'. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can express Adrien's salary as 1.3x. We are given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, so we can set up the equation:

1.3x = 40000

To find 'x', we can divide both sides by 1.3:

x = 40000 / 1.3
x = 30769.23

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30769.23.

Now, we need to find Adrien's salary four years later. We are given that his salary increased by 40% of his original salary. We can express this as:

New salary = Original salary + (40% of Original salary)
= 40000 + (0.4 * 40000)
= 40000 + 16000
= 56000

Now, we need to find Lylah's salary four years later. Since their salaries increased simultaneously, we can assume the percentage increase in Lylah's salary is the same as Adrien's, which is 40%. We can express Lylah's new salary as:

New salary = Original salary + (40% of Original salary)
= 30769.23 + (0.4 * 30769.23)
= 30769.23 + 12307.69
= 43076.92

Now, we can find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later:

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
= 56000 + 43076.92
= 99076.92

The final answer is: $99077"
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to first calculate how many sheets he uses in a week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a month.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So, the total number of sheets he uses in a week is 2 * 30 = 60 sheets.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the number of sheets used in a week by 4 to get the total number of sheets used in a month. 

60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of fruits, we first need to determine the number of fruits each person brought. 

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. 

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, so Kael brought 2 * 5 = 10 apples. 
Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, so Kael brought 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

Now, we need to find the total number of fruits each person brought. 
Morisette brought 5 + 8 = 13 fruits. 
Kael brought 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of fruits each person brought. 
13 (Morisette's fruits) + 14 (Kael's fruits) = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate the hours she slept on each day and add them up.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

The rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday) she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours she slept for each period:

- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday and Wednesday: 2 days * 6 hours = 12 hours
- Thursday to Sunday: 5 days * 7 hours = 35 hours

Now, let's add up the total hours: 8 + 12 + 35 = 55

"To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour.

First, let's calculate the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's calculate the remaining time after 3 hours:
Total time = 7 hours
Time already run = 3 hours
Remaining time = Total time - Time already run
Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours
Remaining time = 4 hours

Now, let's calculate the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distances together to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours:
Total distance = Distance at 10 miles/hour + Distance at 5 miles/hour
Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total distance = 50 miles

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many letters Jennie stamped and then subtract that from the total number of letters that were already stamped when she began.

We know that Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. Since there are 60 letters needing stamps, one-third of that is 60 / 3 = 20 letters.

We also know that after Jennie stamped 20 letters, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This means that the 20 letters Jennie stamped were added to the pile of already-stamped letters.

So, to find out how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began, we need to subtract the 20 letters Jennie stamped from the current number of letters in the pile (30). 

30 - 20 = 10

Therefore, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Julia initially bought a package of spoons, but we don't know the quantity yet. Let's call this quantity 'x'.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons while making the stew.
4. When she went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons.

Now, let's write an equation to represent the situation:

Initial spoons (x) + spoons from her husband (5) - spoons used (3) = Total spoons (12)

x + 5 - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation:

x + 2 = 12

Subtract 2 from both sides:

x = 10

So, Julia bought 10 spoons in the package.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages. 

First, let's find the number of fish sausages. Since Dylan bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, we can add 6 to the number of chicken sausages: 
38 (chicken sausages) + 6 = 44 (fish sausages)

Now, we can add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages to find the total number of sausages:
38 (chicken sausages) + 44 (fish sausages) = 82

The final answer is: 82"
"To find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we first need to determine the number of friends Amy has. Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily has 50 friends, we can calculate Amy's friends by adding 20 to Lily's friends.

Amy's friends = Lily's friends + 20
Amy's friends = 50 + 20
Amy's friends = 70

Now, to find the total number of friends they have together, we add the number of friends Lily and Amy have.

Total friends = Lily's friends + Amy's friends
Total friends = 50 + 70
Total friends = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to determine the cost of each item and then multiply it by the quantity.

First, let's find the cost of a watermelon. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs $15, the cost of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45.

Next, we find the cost of an orange. An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so the cost of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each item:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is the sum of the costs of all items: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

The final answer is: $880"
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total time spent by doctors and the total amount charged to patients, then subtract the cost from the revenue.

First, let's find the total time spent by doctors. The hospital sees 500 people a day, and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. 

Total time spent by doctors = 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours.

Total time spent by doctors = 12000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The doctors charge $150 an hour, so the total cost to the hospital is:

Total cost to the hospital = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30000

Now, let's find the total amount charged to patients. The hospital charges $200 an hour, and the total time spent is 200 hours.

Total amount charged to patients = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40000

The profit made by the hospital is the difference between the total amount charged to patients and the total cost to the hospital.

Profit = Total amount charged to patients - Total cost to the hospital
Profit = $40000 - $30000
Profit = $10000

"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the total number of rides taken by Pam and Fred and then multiply it by the cost of each ride.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she took a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he took a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

The total number of rides taken by both Pam and Fred is 4 + 6 = 10 rides.

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is 10 * 6 = 60.

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we first need to determine how many miles he walked on Tuesday. 

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. 
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, which is 4 * 6 = 24 miles.

Now, we know that his total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. We already know that he walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday. 

So, the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles. 

To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday: 41 - 28 = 13 miles.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 

First, let's find out how many questions Mark completed in 8 hours: 
8 hours * 5 questions per hour = 40 questions

Since Mark completed 40 questions in 8 hours, he left 75 - 40 = 35 questions incomplete in the first test.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour.

Now, let's find out how many questions Mark completed in 6 hours: 
6 hours * 5 questions per hour = 30 questions

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine the total number of semi-automatic cars. 

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars by dividing the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100

"Let's break down the information given. 

Let's denote the number of baby bees as B, the number of worker bees as W, and the number of queens as Q. 

We know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B. 

We also know that there are twice as many babies as queens, so B = 2Q.

We are given that the total number of bees is 700, so W + B + Q = 700.

Substituting W = 2B and B = 2Q into the total equation, we get 2B + B + Q = 700, which simplifies to 3B + Q = 700.

Since B = 2Q, we can substitute this into the equation to get 3(2Q) + Q = 700, which simplifies to 6Q + Q = 700, or 7Q = 700.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100.

Now that we know Q = 100, we can find B by substituting Q into the equation B = 2Q, which gives us B = 2(100) = 200.

Finally, we can find W by substituting B into the equation W = 2B, which gives us W = 2(200) = 400.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of food items and non-food items separately and then add them together.

Food items: milk and eggs
Cost of milk = 2 dollars
Cost of eggs = 3 dollars
Total cost of food items = 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Non-food items: light bulbs, cups, and roach traps
Cost of light bulbs = 3 dollars
Cost of cups = 3 dollars
Cost of roach traps = 4 dollars
Total cost of non-food items = 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount.
Tax amount = 10% of 10 dollars = 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar

Now, we add the tax amount to the total cost of non-food items.
Total cost of non-food items with tax = 10 + 1 = 11 dollars

Now, we add the total cost of food items and non-food items with tax to get the final total.
Total cost = 5 + 11 = 16 dollars

"To calculate the total income, we need to consider all 8 clients (3 current and 5 potential). 

Each client will need 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. So, the total number of bottles of bleach needed is 8 * 2 = 16, and the total number of packs of cloths needed is 8 * 1 = 8.

The cost of bleach is $2 per bottle, so the total cost of bleach is 16 * $2 = $32. The cost of cloths is $5 per pack, so the total cost of cloths is 8 * $5 = $40.

The total expenses are the sum of the cost of bleach and the cost of cloths, which is $32 + $40 = $72.

Since the total income is $92, the profit is the difference between the total income and the total expenses, which is $92 - $72 = $20.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.

In the next 6 hours, half of the bees that left return, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.

In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees leave the hive as the initial 30, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.

So, the total number of bees that left the hive before the last 6 hours is 30 + 15 = 45 bees.

In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left before that return to the hive, which is 45 bees.

Therefore, Debra saw 45 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

"To find out who will win the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distance from miles to feet for both Steve and Tim. Since 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet, we can convert their distances as follows:

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school:

Steve's time: distance / speed = 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: distance / speed = 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes to get home and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will win the race. To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to subtract the winner's time from the loser's time:

Waiting time = Tim's time - Steve's time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

First, let's calculate the cost of inflating the bicycle tires. Each bicycle has 2 tires, and there were 5 bicycles. So, the total number of bicycle tires is 5 * 2 = 10. The cost of inflating these tires is 10 * 25 cents = $2.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of inflating the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and there were 3 tricycles. So, the total number of tricycle tires is 3 * 3 = 9. The cost of inflating these tires is 9 * 25 cents = $2.25.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of inflating the unicycle tire. A unicycle has 1 tire, and there was 1 unicycle. So, the total number of unicycle tires is 1 * 1 = 1. The cost of inflating this tire is 1 * 25 cents = $0.25.

Now, let's add up the total cost of inflating all the tires: $2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.00.

The final answer is: $5.00"
"To find out how much change Carl receives, we first need to calculate the total cost of the cookies. 

There are 10 packs of cookies, and each pack has 6 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is 10 * 6 = 60 cookies.

Each cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost of the cookies is 60 * $0.10 = $6.

Carl pays with a $10 bill, so the change he receives is $10 - $6 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Dave ate 14 french fries initially.
2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   Now, the total amount eaten by Dave and the seagull is 14 + 7 = 21 french fries.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 french fries.
   Now, the total amount eaten is 21 + 9 = 30 french fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries. Let's denote the initial amount of fries as 'x'. 
   After the seagull and pigeons ate, the remaining amount is x - 30.
   The raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is (2/3) * (x - 30).
   The remaining amount after the raccoon is (x - 30) - (2/3) * (x - 30).
   Simplifying this, we get (1/3) * (x - 30).
5. After the raccoon, ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. 
   So, the remaining amount after the raccoon is (1/3) * (x - 30) - 1 = 5.
   Now, we can solve for 'x'.
   (1/3) * (x - 30) = 6
   x - 30 = 18
   x = 48

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a week, we need to calculate the total hours for each type of day and then add them up.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour. So, the total hours for these days are 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 such days in a week, the total hours for these days are 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours. So, the total hours for these days are 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 such days in a week, the total hours for these days are 2 * 4 = 8 hours.

The total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a week is 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester is 17 * 16 = 272 hours.

The final answer is: 272"
"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of the baguettes from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is 2 * 12 = 24 inches long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches

Now, let's add the total length of each type of baked good together:

1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12:

3360 inches / 12 = 280 feet

"To find the total number of bananas needed for 2 months, we need to calculate the total number of bananas needed for each type of ape and then add them together.

The monkeys need 200 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 200 * 2 = 400 bananas.

The gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 400 * 2 = 800 bananas.

The baboons need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, let's add the total number of bananas needed for each type of ape: 400 (monkeys) + 800 (gorillas) + 200 (baboons) = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he's running back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. 

To find the total distance Kelly ran, we add the distance she ran back and forth and the distance she ran to the 40-yard line and back. So, the total distance Kelly ran is 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

Since 3000 is greater than 2920, Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance. So, 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

The final answer is: 80"

"To find the number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond now, we need to subtract the number of tadpoles that hid under the rock from the number of tadpoles that came out from under the lily pad.

Initially, Finn saw 11 tadpoles. 

6 tadpoles came out from under the lily pad, so now there are 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles.

Then, 2 tadpoles hid under the rock, so we subtract 2 from 17: 17 - 2 = 15.

Therefore, Finn can see 15 tadpoles in the pond now.

"To find the depth of the water on Wednesday, we need to first find the depth of the water on Tuesday. 

The depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth of the water on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find two thirds of 24, we multiply 24 by 2/3.

24 * (2/3) = 16

So, the depth of the water on Wednesday is 16 feet.

"To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin, we need to add the number of starfish, sea horses, and clownfish he caught. 

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 

Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Now, let's find the number of fish caught by Locsin. 

Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.

Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.

Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Now, let's find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin.

Total fish caught = Total fish caught by Anakin + Total fish caught by Locsin
Total fish caught = 19 + 13
Total fish caught = 32

"To find out how many times Sandra has to babysit, we need to determine how many eggs she needs in total for the Spanish flans and then divide that by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs needed for 15 Spanish flans. Since each flan requires 3 eggs, we multiply 15 by 3:

15 * 3 = 45 eggs

Now, we know Sandra gets 9 eggs per babysitting job. To find out how many times she needs to babysit, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job:

45 eggs / 9 eggs per babysitting job = 5 babysitting jobs

So, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to get enough eggs for 15 Spanish flans.

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. We are given that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write an equation:

S = 2B

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This means that in 2 years, Seth's age will be S + 2 and Brooke's age will be B + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write another equation:

S + 2 + B + 2 = 28

Combine like terms:

S + B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

S + B = 24

Now we can substitute S = 2B into this equation:

2B + B = 24

Combine like terms:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red.
2. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four.
3. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, and Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.

From point 3, we know Sally Four is 8 years old. 

From point 2, we can calculate Granny Red's age: 
Granny Red's age = 2 * Sally Four's age
Granny Red's age = 2 * 8
Granny Red's age = 16

From point 1, we can calculate Sally Two's age: 
Sally Two's age = Granny Red's age + 3
Sally Two's age = 16 + 3
Sally Two's age = 19

Now, we know the ages of Sally Four, Sally Two, and Granny Red. We still need to find the age of the fourth bird, but there's no information about it. However, the question asks for the total age of the four birds. Since we have three birds' ages, we can add them up and assume the fourth bird's age is unknown for now.

Total age of Sally Four, Sally Two, and Granny Red = 8 + 19 + 16
Total age of Sally Four, Sally Two, and Granny Red = 43

Since we don't have information about the fourth bird's age, we can't calculate the total age of all four birds. However, we can express the total age as an equation: 
Total age of all four birds = 43 + unknown age of the fourth bird.

But since the question asks for a numerical answer, we'll assume the fourth bird's age is 0 (which is not possible in reality, but it's a mathematical assumption to provide a numerical answer). 

Total age of all four birds = 43 + 0
Total age of all four birds = 43

The final answer is: 43"
"To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we first need to calculate the increased minimum payments for each debt. 

The minimum payment for the student loans is $300, so 50% more than that would be 300 + (300 * 0.5) = 300 + 150 = $450.

The minimum payment for the credit card is $200, so 50% more than that would be 200 + (200 * 0.5) = 200 + 100 = $300.

The minimum payment for the mortgage is $500, so 50% more than that would be 500 + (500 * 0.5) = 500 + 250 = $750.

Now, we need to add up the increased minimum payments for each debt to find the total monthly payment. 
Total monthly payment = 450 + 300 + 750 = $1500.

To find the total payment in a year, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12.
Total yearly payment = 1500 * 12 = $18,000.

The final answer is: $18,000."
"To find the total time it takes Billy to peel and cut all the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes, then add the time it takes to cut one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds = 5/60 minutes (converting seconds to minutes)

Total time to peel all potatoes: 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes/potato = 90 minutes
Total time to cut all potatoes: 60 potatoes * (5/60) minutes/potato = 5 minutes

Now, we add the total time to peel and cut all potatoes: 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much they made in total from selling lemonade and then subtract the cost of sugar to find the cost of lemons.

Let's start by finding the total revenue from selling lemonade. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Since they made $25 in profit, and we know that profit is revenue minus cost, we can set up an equation to find the total revenue. Let's call the number of gallons they made 'x'. The total revenue is $10x.

The cost of making lemonade is $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar per gallon. So, the total cost per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.

The profit equation is: Total Revenue - Total Cost = Profit
$10x - $5x = $25

Simplifying the equation, we get:
$5x = $25

Dividing both sides by 5, we get:
x = 5

So, they made 5 gallons of lemonade.

Now, we know that the cost of lemons per gallon is $3. To find the total cost of lemons, we multiply the cost per gallon by the number of gallons:
Total cost of lemons = $3 * 5 = $15

Chinese participants = 160

Now, we know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of girls on the Chinese team = Chinese participants - Number of boys
Number of girls on the Chinese team = 160 - 60
Number of girls on the Chinese team = 100

"To find out how much money Zaid has left after all these expenses and donations, we need to follow the order of operations.

First, let's calculate the amount Zaid spends on rent: 1/4 of 6000 is 6000 * 1/4 = 1500.

Next, let's calculate the amount Zaid spends on car fuel: 1/3 of 6000 is 6000 * 1/3 = 2000.

Now, let's subtract the rent and car fuel expenses from Zaid's monthly income: 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500.

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity: 2500 * 1/2 = 1250.

Now, let's subtract the donation from the remaining amount: 2500 - 1250 = 1250.

Zaid gives his daughter 200 and his wife 700, so let's subtract these amounts from the remaining amount: 1250 - 200 - 700 = 350.

Therefore, Zaid will have 350 dollars left after all these expenses and donations.

$50 (first week) + $80 (second week) = $130

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the number of votes the loser got, we first need to find the total number of votes the winner got. Since the winner got 3/4 of the votes, we can calculate this as follows:

Total votes = 80
Winner's votes = 3/4 * Total votes
Winner's votes = 3/4 * 80
Winner's votes = 60

Now, to find the number of votes the loser got, we subtract the winner's votes from the total votes:

Loser's votes = Total votes - Winner's votes
Loser's votes = 80 - 60
Loser's votes = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, and there are 200 pink calla lilies. 

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Then, the number of pink calla lilies is 5x. Since there are 200 pink calla lilies, we can set up the equation 5x = 200.

To find the value of 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 5. 

x = 200 / 5
x = 40

So, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. We are also told that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Therefore, the number of red roses is 4 times the number of white carnations.

Number of red roses = 4 * 40
Number of red roses = 160

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

Let's denote Mark's current age as M and Jean's current age as J. We know that Jean is two years older than Mark, so we can write an equation:

J = M + 2

We are also given that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Two years ago, Mark's age would be M - 2, and Jan's age would be 30 - 2 = 28. We can write an equation based on this information:

M - 2 = (1/2)(28) + 5

Simplifying the equation:

M - 2 = 14 + 5
M - 2 = 19
M = 21

Now that we know Mark's age, we can find Jean's age using the first equation:

J = M + 2
J = 21 + 2
J = 23

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time for each team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them up.

The well-rounded team's total time is 55 seconds per runner, and they have 4 runners. So, their total time is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner runs 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's total time is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, and then find the difference between them.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is 3/6, since there are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. This simplifies to 1/2 or 50%.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4, since the probability of rolling an even number on a six-sided die is 1/2, and we need to roll two even numbers consecutively.

Now, let's convert these probabilities to percentages: 1/2 = 50% and 1/4 = 25%.

The difference in probability is 50% - 25% = 25%.

So, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To find out how many apples Jenna picked, we need to determine half of the number of apples her mom picked. Since her mom picked 20 apples, we can calculate Jenna's share by dividing 20 by 2.

20 / 2 = 10

Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom picked 20, Jenna picked 10 apples. To find the total number of apples they both picked, we need to add Jenna's share to her mom's share.

20 (mom's apples) + 10 (Jenna's apples) = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the number of rats in each cage, we first need to determine the total number of small rodents (rats and hamsters) and the total number of straws given to them. 

Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'r'. Since there are 3 cages of rats, the total number of rats is 3r. 

The total number of hamsters is 10. Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw, so the total number of straws given to hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

The total number of straws given to small rodents (rats and hamsters) is 160. Since 50 straws are given to hamsters, the remaining straws are given to rats. So, the number of straws given to rats is 160 - 50 = 110.

Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, so the total number of rats is 110 / 6 = 18.33. However, since the number of rats must be a whole number, we can assume that the number of rats is a multiple of 6. 

Since there are 3 cages of rats, the total number of rats is 3r. We know that the total number of rats is 18.33, but since it's a multiple of 6, we can round it to the nearest multiple of 6, which is 18. 

So, the total number of rats is 18. To find the number of rats in each cage, we divide the total number of rats by 3: 18 / 3 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To calculate the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months and add it to the initial amount.

The monthly interest rate is 2%, which is 0.02 as a decimal. 

The interest for the first month is $100 * 0.02 = $2.
The interest for the second month is $102 * 0.02 = $2.04.
The interest for the third month is $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808.

Now, let's add the interest for all three months to the initial amount:
$100 + $2 + $2.04 + $2.0808 = $106.1208.

So, Mandy should pay $106.12 to Benedict. 

106.12"
"To find the number of bags the trader sold, we need to first calculate the total cost and total revenue. 

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The total cost of buying the bags is $20x (since each bag costs $20).
The total cost of transporting the bags is $2x (since each bag costs $2 to transport).
The total cost is the sum of the buying cost and the transportation cost: $20x + $2x = $22x.

The total revenue from selling the bags is $30x (since each bag is sold at $30).

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: $30x - $22x = $8x.

We are given that the profit is $400, so we can set up the equation: $8x = $400.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 8: x = $400 / $8.

x = 50.

"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide it by 3.

First, let's find the cost of the food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. Since they spent $20.25 on tickets, the cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

The cost of the rides is 2 rides * $33 per ride = $66.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3: $102 / 3 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"To find out how many peaches John collects, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he collects peaches and then multiply it by the number of peaches he collects per minute.

Since John collects peaches for 3 hours, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, we know John collects 2 peaches per minute. To find the total number of peaches, we multiply the total minutes by the peaches collected per minute:

180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

So, John collects 360 peaches.

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ducks needs per day, we first need to calculate the total pounds of insects they need per week. 

Since there are ten ducks and each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, we multiply the number of ducks by the pounds of insects each duck needs per week:

10 ducks * 3.5 pounds/duck/week = 35 pounds/week

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of insects they need per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total pounds of insects needed per week by 7:

35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

So, the flock of ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day.

"To find the total number of trees Tom has left, we need to calculate the net change in the number of trees over 10 years.

Initially, Tom has 50 trees.

Each year, he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees. So, the net change in trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8.

Over 10 years, the net change in trees is 8 * 10 = 80.

So, the total number of trees Tom has after 10 years is 50 + 80 = 130.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we multiply 130 by 0.3 (which is 30% as a decimal).

Number of trees that die = 130 * 0.3 = 39.

Now, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years to find the final number of trees Tom has.

Number of trees left = 130 - 39 = 91.

The final answer is: 91"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos on Sue's front yard.

On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out on Sue's front yard. So, now there are 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. Now, there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos.

The total number of flamingos on Sue's front yard is 30 pink + 6 white = 36 flamingos.

To find out how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

"To find out how much change Violetta will get, we need to first calculate the total cost of the crayons. Since she wants 5 crayons and each crayon costs $2, we multiply the number of crayons by the cost per crayon.

Total cost = Number of crayons * Cost per crayon
Total cost = 5 * $2
Total cost = $10

Since Violetta prepared $20 for the purchase, we subtract the total cost from the amount she prepared to find the change.

Change = Amount prepared - Total cost
Change = $20 - $10
Change = $10

Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens. 

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $12.00

Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. 

Total pounds of carrots used = Number of restaurants * Pounds per restaurant
Total pounds of carrots used = 40 * 2
Total pounds of carrots used = 80 pounds

Now, we subtract the total pounds of carrots used from the total pounds of carrots available to find out how many pounds will not be used.

Pounds of carrots not used = Total pounds of carrots - Total pounds of carrots used
Pounds of carrots not used = 200 - 80
Pounds of carrots not used = 120

We know that Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 2 * 5 cents = 10 cents per sentence.

Mark's total earnings from Publisher A are 1000 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 5000 cents.

Mark's total earnings from Publisher B are 1000 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 10000 cents.

New weekly salary = Old weekly salary + Raise
New weekly salary = 2000 + 100 = 2100

Since John got the award on the first day of the year, he will receive the $5000 reward only once. 

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the year:

"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to find the total score she needs for the semester. Since there are six tests and she wants an average of 93, we multiply 93 by 6 to get the total score.

Total score needed = Average score * Number of tests
Total score needed = 93 * 6
Total score needed = 558

Next, we add up the scores of the first five tests and subtract the lowest score to get the total score Brinley has so far.

Scores of the first five tests = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86
Scores of the first five tests = 338

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score among the five tests. The lowest score is 71.

Total score so far = Scores of the first five tests - Lowest score
Total score so far = 338 - 71
Total score so far = 267

Half a dozen plates cost 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

Now, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since twenty dozen cups is equal to 20 * 12 = 240 cups, we can find the cost of each cup by dividing the total cost by the number of cups.

Cost of each cup = Total cost of twenty dozen cups / Number of cups

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy and the total amount of money she has earned so far.

The total cost of the items is the cost of the jacket plus the cost of 2 pairs of shoes: 
$30 (jacket) + 2 * $20 (shoes) = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved before she started babysitting. She earns $5 each time she babysits the kids, so the total amount she has earned from babysitting is:
$5 * number of times she babysits.

Let's denote the number of times she babysits as 'x'. Then, the total amount she has earned from babysitting is $5x.

She also earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. Let's denote the number of times she mows the lawn as 'y'. Then, the total amount she has earned from mowing the lawn is $4y.

The total amount of money she has is the sum of the money she already had, the money she earned from babysitting, and the money she earned from mowing the lawn:
$10 (initial savings) + $5x (babysitting) + $4y (mowing the lawn).

Since she wants to buy the jacket and shoes, the total amount of money she has must be greater than or equal to the total cost of the items:
$10 + $5x + $4y ≥ $70.

We want to find the minimum number of times she must mow the lawn, so we want to find the smallest value of 'y' that satisfies the inequality. To do this, we can first subtract $10 from both sides of the inequality:
$5x + $4y ≥ $60.

Since we want to find the minimum value of 'y', we can try to find the smallest value of 'x' that satisfies the inequality. We know that $5x must be less than or equal to $60 - $4y, so we can write:
$5x ≤ $60 - $4y.

Now, we can try to find the smallest value of 'y' that satisfies the inequality. We can do this by trying different values of 'y' and finding the corresponding values of 'x'.

If y = 0, then $5x ≤ $60, which means x ≤ 12. However, this is not the smallest value of 'y' that satisfies the inequality.

If y = 1, then $5x ≤ $56, which means x ≤ 11.2. This is not an integer, so we cannot use this value of 'y'.

If y = 2, then $5x ≤ $52, which means x ≤ 10.4. This is not an integer, so we cannot use this value of 'y'.

If y = 3, then $5x ≤ $48, which means x ≤ 9.6. This is not an integer, so we cannot use this value of 'y'.

If y = 4, then $5x ≤ $44, which means x ≤ 8.8. This is not an integer, so we cannot use this value of 'y'.

If y = 5, then $5x ≤ $40, which means x ≤ 8. This is an integer, so we can use this value of 'y'.

If y = 5, then the total amount of money she has is:
$10 + $5x + $4y = $10 + $5(8) + $4(5) = $10 + $40 + $20 = $70.

This is equal to the total cost of the items, so she can afford the jacket and shoes if she mows the lawn 5 times.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. We know that W = R + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42. Since each red chicken produces 3 eggs and each white chicken produces 5 eggs, we can set up the following equation:

3R + 5W = 42

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

"To find the time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park since he walks around the edge. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the dimensions of the park, l = 6 miles and w = 1.5 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the perimeter by his speed:

Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. We know that the number of customers on the second day is 50 more than the first day, so it can be represented as x + 50.

The total number of customers by the third day is 500, which is the sum of the customers from the first two days and the customers on the third day. We can represent this as an equation:

x + (x + 50) + y = 500

where y is the number of customers on the third day.

We are given that Sloane counted 100 customers on the first day, so we can substitute x = 100 into the equation:

100 + (100 + 50) + y = 500

Combine like terms:

100 + 150 + y = 500

Combine the constants:

250 + y = 500

Subtract 250 from both sides:

y = 250

So, the number of customers on the third day is 250.

The final answer is: 250"
"Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.

In 4 minutes, the total water lost from both pools is 8 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 32 gallons.

The big pool initially had 2x gallons of water. After losing 32 gallons, it has 2x - 32 gallons of water. 

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as 'y'. Then, the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y.

We can set up the equation: 2x - 32 = 4y

Since the small pool initially had x gallons of water and lost some amount of water, the current amount of water in the small pool is x - (some amount of water lost). However, we don't know the exact amount of water lost from the small pool. 

However, we can use the fact that the total water lost from both pools is 32 gallons. Since the big pool lost 32 gallons, the small pool must have lost the remaining amount, which is 32 gallons. 

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is x - 32.

Now, we can set up the equation: 2x - 32 = 4(x - 32)

Simplifying the equation: 
2x - 32 = 4x - 128
-32 + 128 = 4x - 2x
96 = 2x
x = 48

The initial amount of water in the small pool is 48 gallons. 

The current amount of water in the small pool is x - 32 = 48 - 32 = 16 gallons.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn, which is the cost of the shoes and the belt. 

Total cost = Cost of shoes + Cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Since Lori earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total cost by her hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work.

Hours to work = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours to work = $352.00 / $8.00
Hours to work = 44 hours

The final answer is: 44"
"To find the remaining balance, we first need to calculate the total amount Janeth will pay in 12 months. 

Janeth pays $165 per month for 12 months, so the total amount she will pay is:
$165 * 12 = $1980

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. The additional amount is 10% of $2000, which is:
$2000 * 0.10 = $200

So, the total amount Janeth will pay is the borrowed amount plus the additional amount:
$2000 + $200 = $2200

However, Janeth will only pay $1980, so she will still owe the difference:
$2200 - $1980 = $220

The final answer is: $220"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to determine the number of dahlias and add it to the number of roses.

We know there are 4 roses in the vase. We also know there are 7 more dahlias than roses. 

So, the number of dahlias is 4 (number of roses) + 7 (additional dahlias) = 11 dahlias.

Now, we add the number of roses and dahlias to find the total number of flowers: 4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the average age of the three in three years, we first need to find their current ages and then add 3 to each age. 

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and Harriet is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is 2 * 21 = 42 years old.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age is 3 * 21 = 63 years old.

Now, we have the current ages of the three: Harriet (21), Zack (42), and Adrian (63). 

In three years, their ages will be: Harriet (21 + 3 = 24), Zack (42 + 3 = 45), and Adrian (63 + 3 = 66).

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3: (24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points Yuri and Brianna scored. 

Naomi scored 68 points. 
Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. 
Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 
Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points. 

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know that the total points scored by the four students is 251. 
We can subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total to find out how many points Jojo scored. 
Jojo's points = Total points - (Naomi's points + Yuri's points + Brianna's points) 
Jojo's points = 251 - (68 + 44 + 85) 
Jojo's points = 251 - 197 
Jojo's points = 54

"To find out how much water is left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters, we subtract 90 from the initial 120 liters. 

120 - 90 = 30 liters

Since Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left, we multiply the remaining 30 liters by 2.

30 * 2 = 60 liters

The collected rainwater is added to the remaining 30 liters, so we add 60 to 30.

30 + 60 = 90 liters

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total number of flowers Andy planted, we need to add the number of geraniums and petunias. 

First, let's find the number of petunias. Since there are 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, we can subtract 40 from the number of geraniums: 
90 - 40 = 50

Now, we add the number of geraniums and petunias to find the total number of flowers:
90 (geraniums) + 50 (petunias) = 140

The final answer is: 140"
"To find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we need to calculate the amount spent in the second year first. 

The company spent a third of $15000 in the second year. To find a third of $15000, we divide $15000 by 3.

$15000 / 3 = $5000

Now, we add the amount spent in the first year to the amount spent in the second year to find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years.

$15000 + $5000 = $20000

The total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."
"To find the total cost of the rentals, we need to calculate the cost for Carlos and Benji separately and then add them together.

Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour and uses it for 3 hours. The cost for Carlos is 30 * 3 = $90.

Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour and uses it for 5 hours. The cost for Benji is 18 * 5 = $90.

Now, we add the costs together: 90 (Carlos) + 90 (Benji) = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To find the total number of days Andrew will travel, we need to calculate the total days for the trip to Rochester by bus and the return trip from Rochester by car.

The trip to Rochester by bus takes 6 days. 
The trip from New Jersey to Rochester by car takes half as many days as the bus trip, which is 6 / 2 = 3 days.

Since Andrew will be traveling to Rochester by bus and returning by car, we need to add the days for both trips. 
Total days = days to Rochester by bus + days from Rochester by car = 6 + 3 = 9

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we first need to find the total number of cards James has after losing 8 water type and buying 14 grass type. 

Initially, James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. 

After losing 8 water type cards, he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards.

After buying 14 grass type cards, he has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.

The total number of cards James has now is 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 cards.

The probability of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, which is 32/96.

To find the percentage, we multiply by 100: (32/96) * 100 = 33.333...

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance of picking a water type card is 33."
"To find out how much Chad still owes, we need to calculate the total cost of his meal and then subtract the gift card amount.

The base burrito costs $6.50. 
He adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each, which is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50. 
So, the total cost of the add-ons is $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50.
The total cost of the meal before the upgrade is $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00.
He upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, so the new total is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.
He has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract this from the total: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

"To find the total number of pieces Kalinda and her mom can place per minute, we need to determine how many pieces her mom can place per minute. Since her mom can place half as many pieces as Kalinda, and Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute, her mom can place 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

The total number of pieces they can place per minute is 4 (Kalinda) + 2 (her mom) = 6 pieces per minute.

To find the total time it will take to complete the puzzle, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place per minute. 

360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time from minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Therefore, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

"To find the number of melons not ready to be harvested after two weeks, we need to calculate the number of melons harvested in the second trip and subtract that from the total number of melons remaining after the first trip.

Initially, 30% of 120 melons were harvested in the first trip. 
30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36 melons.

So, the number of melons remaining after the first trip is 120 - 36 = 84 melons.

In the second trip, 3/4 of the remaining melons were harvested. 
3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63 melons.

The number of melons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is the total remaining melons after the first trip minus the number of melons harvested in the second trip.
84 - 63 = 21 melons.

So, Kylie collected 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. To find out how many shells she collected on Tuesday, we multiply the number of shells she collected on Monday by 2.

25 * 2 = 50

Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesday."
"To find the total number of insects in the garden, we first need to determine the number of bugs. Since Dax found half as many bugs as ants, and there were 50 ants, we can calculate the number of bugs as follows:

Number of bugs = Number of ants / 2
Number of bugs = 50 / 2
Number of bugs = 25

Now, to find the total number of insects in the garden, we add the number of ants and bugs:

"To find out how many penguins are left sunbathing, we need to calculate the number of penguins that jumped in the ocean and the number that went inside the cave, then subtract that from the total number of penguins.

One-third of the penguins jumped in the ocean, which is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins.

Another one-third of the penguins went inside the cave, which is also 36 / 3 = 12 penguins.

So, in total, 12 + 12 = 24 penguins left the sunbathing area.

Now, to find out how many penguins are left sunbathing, we subtract the number of penguins that left from the total number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12.

"To find out how many vines Steve needs, we first need to determine how many tomatoes he eats per week. Since Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, we multiply this by 7 to get the total tomatoes he eats per week.

6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we can assume his girlfriend eats half as much as Steve. So, his girlfriend eats 6 / 2 = 3 tomatoes per day. 

3 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 21 tomatoes/week

The total number of tomatoes they both eat per week is 42 (Steve) + 21 (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes/week.

Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines they need, we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by the number of tomatoes each vine produces per week.

63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine/week = 21 vines

So, Steve and his girlfriend need 21 vines to produce enough tomatoes for their weekly consumption.

Total slices required = Number of friends * Number of slices per friend
Total slices required = 20 * 4
Total slices required = 80

Since pizzas are sold in 8 slices, we need to divide the total number of slices required by 8 to find out how many pizzas John needs to order.

Number of pizzas = Total slices required / Number of slices per pizza
Number of pizzas = 80 / 8
Number of pizzas = 10

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Ram starts with 25 pens. 

He uses 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen. This means that for every 5 empty pens, he gets 1 new full pen. 

To find out how many new pens he can make, we need to divide the total number of empty pens by 5. 

25 (initial pens) - 5 (used to make new pens) = 20 empty pens left

20 empty pens / 5 = 4 new pens

Now, we add the new pens to the initial pens: 
25 (initial pens) + 4 (new pens) = 29 pens

"To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we need to determine the ages of Mary and Joan first.

Since Jessa is 20 years old, and Joan is five years older than Jessa, we can calculate Joan's age by adding 5 to Jessa's age: 
Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5
Joan's age = 20 + 5
Joan's age = 25

Now, we know that Mary is two years younger than Joan. To find Mary's age, we subtract 2 from Joan's age:
Mary's age = Joan's age - 2
Mary's age = 25 - 2
Mary's age = 23

Now that we have the ages of all three girls, we can find the sum of their ages:
Sum of ages = Jessa's age + Joan's age + Mary's age
Sum of ages = 20 + 25 + 23
Sum of ages = 68

Now, the remaining students are 1000 - 300 = 700.

3/5 of the remaining 700 students went out through exit B.

3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students went out through exit B.

Now, the remaining students are 700 - 420 = 280.

Dolly will read her own 2 books and Pandora's 1 book, so Dolly will read a total of 3 books.

Pandora will read her own 1 book and Dolly's 2 books, so Pandora will read a total of 3 books.

In total, they will read 3 (Dolly's total) + 3 (Pandora's total) = 6 books.

However, we also need to consider that they read each other's books. This means that Dolly will read Pandora's book and Pandora will read Dolly's book, but this is already included in the count of 6 books.

So, the total number of books they will collectively read by the end is 6.

"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he writes and then multiply it by the time it takes him to write one page.

First, let's find out how many letters Mike writes in a week. He has 3 pen pals left, and each of them sends 2 letters a week. So, the total number of letters he receives is 3 * 2 = 6 letters.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week. 

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages he writes in a week. Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 30 pages * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. So, 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries.

Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin. So, Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. So, Griffin was left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Ginger gave Griffin some fries, and then Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. 

After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin was left with 9 - 2 = 7 fries. But we know that Griffin ended up with 27 fries. So, Ginger must have given Griffin 27 - 7 = 20 fries.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2(2x)

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

14 = 2x

Now, divide both sides by 2 again:

7 = x

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the total hours worked. The makeup artist works 6 hours a day, 4 times a week, for 5 weeks. 

Total hours worked per week = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week
Total hours worked in 5 weeks = 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour. So, the total cost without the discount is:
Total cost = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. To find the discount amount:
Discount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000

The final cost after the discount is:

"To find out how many cookies Sue ate, we need to calculate the number of cookies she ate on both days. 

On Monday, her sister ate 5 cookies, and Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. So, Sue ate 5 * 4 = 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, her sister ate 13 cookies, and Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. So, Sue ate 13 * 2 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Now, we need to find the total number of cookies Sue and her sister ate. Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies, and her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, we can find the total calories consumed by Sue and her sister by multiplying the number of cookies they ate by 200. Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories, and her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we subtract the calories consumed by her sister from the calories consumed by Sue. 9200 - 3600 = 5600.

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the school. 

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60.

The total number of girls in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

We already know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

Now, to find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the total number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls in the school: 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the total number of boys in the school is also 30. 

The total number of boys in the first two classes is 60 - 27 = 33 (since there are 60 students in total and 27 are girls). 

To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the total number of boys in the first two classes from the total number of boys in the school: 30 - 33 is incorrect, we need to find the number of boys in the first two classes. The total number of students in the first two classes is 20 + 20 = 40. The number of girls in the first two classes is 27. So the number of boys in the first two classes is 40 - 27 = 13. 

Now, to find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the total number of boys in the first two classes from the total number of boys in the school: 30 - 13 = 17.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. 

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's represent the number of cougars killed today as 'x'. Then, the number of wolves killed today is 3x.

We also know that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, the number of cougars killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since we know the number of cougars killed today is 12, we can set up the equation 3x = 12 to find the number of wolves killed today. Solving for x, we get x = 4. 

However, we already know that the number of cougars killed today is 12, so we don't need to use x. 

Now, we can find the total number of animals killed by adding the number of wolves and cougars killed last night and today. 

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. Today, he killed 12 cougars and 3x wolves. Since we know 3x = 12, we can find the number of wolves killed today by dividing 12 by 3, which is 4. 

So, the total number of wolves killed today is 4. 

Now, we can add the number of wolves and cougars killed last night and today to find the total number of animals killed. 

Total animals killed = (10 + 15) + (4 + 12) 
Total animals killed = 25 + 16 
Total animals killed = 41

The final answer is: 41"
"To find the floor Bill is on, we need to calculate 4 times his starting floor (3) plus 6.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we first need to find out how many times Anne went down the slide. 

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we need to calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30. 

30% of 30 is 0.3 x 30 = 9. 

So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. 

So, Robert went down the slide 4 x 21 = 84 times.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we first need to determine how many cows Mr. Sylas added to each stall. 

Initially, each stall had 20 cows. Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and divided them equally among the 10 stalls. 

So, the number of cows added to each stall is 40 / 10 = 4 cows.

Now, each stall has 20 (initial cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows.

Since we want to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8.

24 * 8 = 192

The final answer is: 192"
"To find the total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the value of the pennies:
100 pennies = 100 x $0.01 = $1.00

Next, let's calculate the value of the nickels:
40 nickels = 40 x $0.05 = $2.00

Now, let's calculate the value of the dimes:
20 dimes = 20 x $0.10 = $2.00

Finally, let's calculate the value of the dollar bills:
40 dollar bills = 40 x $1.00 = $40.00

Now, let's add up the values of all the coins and bills:
$1.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $40.00 = $45.00

The total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank is $45.00.

$45.00"
"To find the total weight of the redwood tree, we first need to find the total number of 10-foot sections. 

The redwood is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get the total number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so we multiply the number of sections by the weight per section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

Now, we need to find 30% of the total weight that the termites ate. To do this, we multiply the total weight by 0.3 (which is the decimal form of 30%): 8000 * 0.3 = 2400 pounds.

To find the remaining weight of the redwood, we subtract the weight eaten by the termites from the total weight: 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds.

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the total amount Nancy has to pay, we need to calculate the total cost of the overdue books and add the flat fee.

The cost of the overdue books is $0.50 per book, and she has 8 books. So, the total cost of the overdue books is 8 * $0.50 = $4.00.

In addition to the cost of the overdue books, there's a flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book that's over a week overdue. 

So, the total amount Nancy has to pay is $4.00 (cost of overdue books) + $2.00 (flat fee) = $6.00.

The final answer is: $6.00"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples. So, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.
2. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.
3. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.
4. To find the total number of fruits, we need to add the number of apples and bananas that both Andrea and Jamal have. 
   Total fruits = (Andrea's apples + Jamal's apples + Andrea's bananas + Jamal's bananas)
   Total fruits = (52 + 44 + 24 + 48)
   Total fruits = 168

The final answer is: 168"
"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we first need to determine how many cups are needed for each day. 

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens are in 36 cookies. 

36 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 3 dozen cookies

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 1 dozen cookies, we multiply the number of dozens by 2 to find the total cups needed for today.

3 dozen cookies * 2 cups per dozen = 6 cups

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. Again, we need to find out how many dozens are in 30 cookies.

30 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 2.5 dozen cookies

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 1 dozen cookies, we multiply the number of dozens by 2 to find the total cups needed for tomorrow.

2.5 dozen cookies * 2 cups per dozen = 5 cups

Now, we add the cups needed for both days to find the total cups of flour Carla needs.

6 cups (today) + 5 cups (tomorrow) = 11 cups

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to first find two thirds of 9,300 pennies.

Two thirds of 9,300 is calculated as (2/3) * 9,300 = 6,200.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to get the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = $62.

The final answer is: $62"
"To find out how many marbles Maddison has now, we need to first calculate the total number of marbles she had initially and then add the marbles she received from her friend.

Maddison has 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each box, so the total number of marbles she had initially is:
5 boxes * 50 marbles/box = 250 marbles

Then, she received 20 marbles from her friend. To find the total number of marbles she has now, we add the marbles she received to the initial number of marbles:
250 marbles + 20 marbles = 270 marbles

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the number of trees in each yard, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Chris has 6 trees.
2. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has. 
   So, Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.
3. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has.
   First, we find twice the number of trees Ferdinand has: 2 * 3 = 6
   Then, we add 5 to that: 6 + 5 = 11
   So, Harry has 11 trees.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard.
Harry has 11 trees, and Ferdinand has 3 trees.
The difference is 11 - 3 = 8

Carmen has $100. 
Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125. 
Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, we add up the amount of money each girl has: $100 + $125 + $175 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To find the total price of the house, we need to add the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee. 

The selling price is $350,000. 
The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500.
The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

Now, let's add the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee to find the total price of the house:
$350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

To find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to subtract her budget from the total price:

The final answer is: $9,500"
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid in fees and subtract that from the selling price, then subtract the remaining loan amount.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 is 0.03 x $400,000 = $12,000.

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 is 0.05 x $400,000 = $20,000.

The total fees paid by Mr. Tan is $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

Now, let's subtract the total fees from the selling price: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000.

"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we first need to determine the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette. 

The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is a 1800-stitch project, the total number of stitches used for the body and the sleeves is 1800 - 270 = 1530 stitches.

The body takes 900 stitches, so the sleeves take 1530 - 900 = 630 stitches in total.

Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each scene and the song, and then add them together.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has (4/5) * 60 = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we first need to find their current ages. Since the sum of their ages is 20, we can represent their ages as x and 20 - x.

Let's say Mico's age is x and Marco's age is 20 - x.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be x + 10 and Marco's age will be (20 - x) + 10.

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (x + 10) + (20 - x + 10).

Simplifying the expression, we get:

"Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S. 

We are given that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so we can write this as an equation: R = 6S.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9. We are also given that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write this as another equation: R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for S. 

R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Divide both sides by 3:
S = 6

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

"To find the total number of spots on the cobras, we need to multiply the number of cobras by the number of spots on each cobra. 

Number of cobras: 40
Spots per cobra: 70
Total spots on cobras: 40 * 70 = 2800

Since the cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can find the number of spots on a mamba by dividing the number of spots on a cobra by 2.

Spots per mamba: 70 / 2 = 35

Now, we can find the total number of spots on the mambas by multiplying the number of mambas by the number of spots on each mamba.

Number of mambas: 60
Spots per mamba: 35
Total spots on mambas: 60 * 35 = 2100

To find the total number of spots on all the snakes, we add the total spots on the cobras and the mambas.

Total spots on all snakes: 2800 + 2100 = 4900

Finally, to find half the number of spots they all have combined, we divide the total number of spots by 2.

Half the total spots: 4900 / 2 = 2450"
"To find out how many pizzas Maddy needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of people she needs to serve. 

There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of team members and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. 

Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. 

The total number of people Maddy needs to serve is 15 (team members and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, the total number of pizzas Maddy needs to buy is 39 / 3 = 13.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total amount Maddy will spend is 13 * 15 = $195.

"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

First, let's find the total time she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

Total time worked = 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the total time to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:

150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval:

"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we first need to determine how many oranges the sons washed. 

The oldest son is 8 years old, and he washes as many oranges as he is years old, so he washes 8 oranges. 

The youngest son is half as old as the oldest son, which means he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. He also washes as many oranges as he is years old, so he washes 4 oranges.

In total, the sons wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Since Will buys 15 oranges, the number of oranges left unwashed is 15 - 12 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total count of activities, we need to calculate the number of each activity done on both days and then add them up.

On the first day, Darren does:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

On the second day, he does:
- 20 more pushups than the first day, so 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 10 fewer squats than the first day, so 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- Doubles the number of dumbbell presses, so 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Now, let's add up the total number of each activity:
- Total pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Total squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Total dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

The total count of activities is the sum of the total number of each activity: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370.

"To find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then divide the total amount of rice available by that amount.

First, let's calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day. Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 3 meals per day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). Since 5 members of the household eat rice every lunch and dinner, we'll assume they also eat it for breakfast. So, the total number of people eating rice per day is 5.

Total rice consumed per person per day = 0.2 kg/meal * 3 meals = 0.6 kg/day
Total rice consumed by 5 people per day = 0.6 kg/day * 5 people = 3 kg/day

Now, let's calculate how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last:

Total rice available = 42 kg
Total rice consumed per day = 3 kg

Number of days a 42 kg bag of rice will last = Total rice available / Total rice consumed per day
= 42 kg / 3 kg/day
= 14 days

Since we want to find out how many weeks it will last, we'll divide the number of days by 7 (number of days in a week):

Number of weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last = 14 days / 7 days/week
= 2 weeks

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first need to calculate the total number of crates he sold in the week. 

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he sold bread for 5 days. 

He sold 20 crates over the weekend, which is 2 days. 
He sold 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday.

Total crates sold = 20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) 
Total crates sold = 65

Since he was closed on Monday and Friday, he had 5 working days. His target for the week was 120 crates, but he had 6 days to achieve it (since he was closed on 2 days). 

To find the target for 5 working days, we need to calculate the daily target: 
Daily target = 120 / 6 
Daily target = 20

Now, we can find the target for 5 working days: 
Target for 5 working days = 20 * 5 
Target for 5 working days = 100

Now, we can find out how many crates Sam was off from his target: 
Crates off target = Target for 5 working days - Total crates sold 
Crates off target = 100 - 65 
Crates off target = 35

The final answer is: 35"
"To find out how much Carmen paid for the desk, we need to determine the total number of bids she made, including her initial bid. Since there were 3 other people who bid once, and Carmen bid after each of them, she made 3 additional bids. Including her initial bid, she made a total of 4 bids.

The initial bid was $200, and each subsequent bid increased by $50. So, the total cost of the desk can be calculated as follows:

Initial bid: $200
First additional bid: $200 + $50 = $250
Second additional bid: $250 + $50 = $300
Third additional bid: $300 + $50 = $350
Fourth bid (final): $350 + $50 = $400

The final bid, which is the total cost of the desk, is $400.

The final answer is: $400"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total miles driven, the total cost of driving, and the total bonus given to the driver.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven per day:
Distance to work = 30 miles
Total distance per day = 2 * 30 = 60 miles

Since John goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, the total miles driven per year is:
Total miles per year = 60 miles/day * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year

Now, let's calculate the total cost of driving per year:
Cost per mile = $2
Total cost per year = 15,000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30,000/year

John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus per year is:
Total bonus per year = $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800/year

Now, let's calculate the total cost per year, including the bonus:
Total cost per year = Total cost of driving per year + Total bonus per year
Total cost per year = $30,000/year + $1,800/year = $31,800/year

The final answer is: $31,800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to add the minutes he exercised on both days. 

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined minutes by 2.

Combined minutes: 39
Twice the combined minutes: 39 * 2 = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

78"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of pages and how they are arranged in the tabloid. 

In a standard tabloid, the pages are arranged in a way that the first page is on the left back, the second page is on the left front, the 32nd page is on the right back, and the 31st page is on the right front. 

Since the pages are folded, we can think of it as a single sheet of paper being folded in half, with the first page on the left back and the second page on the left front. This means that the first and second pages share a common edge. 

The same applies to the 31st and 32nd pages, which are on the right back and right front, respectively. 

So, we can consider the first and second pages as one piece of paper, and the 31st and 32nd pages as another piece of paper. 

This means that we need 16 pieces of paper to make a 32-page tabloid, since 32 pages can be divided into 16 pairs.

"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to first calculate how much she spent on food and snacks. Since she spent half of her $50 on food and snacks, we can calculate this as:

$50 / 2 = $25

So, she spent $25 on food and snacks. Then, she spent an additional $10 on rides. 

Total amount spent = $25 (food and snacks) + $10 (rides) = $35

Now, to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:

$50 (initial amount) - $35 (total amount spent) = $15

So, Annika has $15 left.

The final answer is: $15"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Total books = 250
- Unsold books = 50
- Books sold this year = 45
- Books sold in the first year = 2 * Books sold this year = 2 * 45 = 90
- Books sold in the second year = Total books - Unsold books - Books sold this year - Books sold in the first year
= 250 - 50 - 45 - 90
= 65

Since each book sells at $20, the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
Total money earned in the second year = Books sold in the second year * Price per book
= 65 * 20
= 1300

The final answer is: $1300"
"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week: 
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Since Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

In a month, there are approximately 4 weeks. So, his total earnings from his hourly wage in April are:
$500/week * 4 weeks = $2000

Additionally, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. Since the company performed well for the whole month, he gets a bonus for 4 weeks:
$300/week * 4 weeks = $1200

Now, let's add his earnings from his hourly wage and the bonus to find his total earnings in April:
$2000 + $1200 = $3200

The final answer is: $3200"
"To find out how many people John lost to, we need to find out how many people he beat and then subtract that from the total number of people he arm wrestled.

First, let's find out how many people John beat. 80% of 20 is 0.8 x 20 = 16 people.

Now, let's subtract the number of people John beat from the total number of people he arm wrestled. 20 - 16 = 4 people.

So, John lost to 4 people.

"To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we first need to determine how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 

Two-thirds of 60 is calculated as (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves. 

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning. 

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

The total number of loaves produced is 60, and 40 are sold in the morning. 

60 - 40 = 20 loaves are left after the morning sales.

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. 

Half of 20 is calculated as (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are divided equally between the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much weight Joey loses per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight Joey loses per week, we divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks:

Weight lost per week = Total weight lost / Number of weeks
Weight lost per week = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weight lost per week = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we multiply the weight lost per week by the number of weeks Sandy needs:

Total weight lost = Weight lost per week * Number of weeks
Total weight lost = 2 pounds/week * 4 weeks
Total weight lost = 8 pounds

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, the answer is 4 weeks.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $13 = $26. The discounted price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $11 = $22. The savings on 2 tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $1 = $4. The discounted price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x ($1 - $0.5) = 4 x $0.5 = $2. The savings on 4 packets of milk is $4 - $2 = $2.

The total savings is $4 + $2 = $6.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs grown by the person after 15 days.

The person grows an extra arm every 3 days. To find out how many extra arms are grown in 15 days, we divide 15 by 3. 

15 / 3 = 5

So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

The person grows an extra leg every 5 days. To find out how many extra legs are grown in 15 days, we divide 15 by 5.

15 / 5 = 3

So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

Now, we add the number of extra arms and legs to find the total number of new limbs.

5 (extra arms) + 3 (extra legs) = 8

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount spent by Theo on the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket, and then subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount he had, and then subtract the amount he wishes to save.

First, let's calculate the total amount spent on business suits:
6 business suits at $100 each = 6 x $100 = $600

Next, let's calculate the total amount spent on suitcases:
3 suitcases at $50 each = 3 x $50 = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. 
Cost of a business suit = $100
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 x $100 = $500
Cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's calculate the total amount spent on business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket:
Total amount spent = $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount he had:
Initial amount = $6000
Total amount spent = $1950
Amount left = $6000 - $1950 = $4050

Now, let's subtract the amount he wishes to save from the amount left:
Amount left = $4050
Amount to save = $2000
Amount left for gifts = $4050 - $2000 = $2050

Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so the total number of eggs consumed by this group per day is 3 * 3 = 9 eggs. 

The rest of the family members are 5 - 3 = 2. They eat 2 eggs each day, so the total number of eggs consumed by this group per day is 2 * 2 = 4 eggs.

The total number of eggs consumed by the family per day is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week is 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Noah's current age as N and the population of Chile now as P.

Since Cera is 46 years old now, six years ago, Cera was 40 years old.

We are given that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. So, six years ago, Noah's age was 40 / 2 = 20 years.

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. So, the population of Chile six years ago was 20 * 3000 = 60000.

It is given that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. So, the population of Chile now is 2 * 60000 = 120000.

The final answer is: 120000"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is D/2.

We know that the total number of players on the team is 105. Therefore, the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams is 105.

We can write the equation as: 2D + D + D/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, we multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 4D + 2D + D = 210

Combine like terms: 7D = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7 to solve for D: D = 210 / 7
D = 30

"To find the total number of people invited, we first need to calculate the number of people from the 2 families with 6 people and the 3 families with 4 people.

For the 2 families with 6 people, the total number of people is 2 * 6 = 12.
For the 3 families with 4 people, the total number of people is 3 * 4 = 12.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. So, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

Now, 1/4 of the people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments. 1/4 of 8 is 2. So, we subtract 2 from the number of people who couldn't come due to illness: 8 - 2 = 6.

The total number of people who couldn't come is 6. We subtract this from the total number of people invited: 24 - 6 = 18.

"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, his father gave him 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 (initial marbles) + 20 (bought from Johanna) + 8 (given by his father) = 98 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 98 * 2 = 196 kgs.

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool first. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as a pool) is length x width x height.

Given dimensions: 
- Length (L) = 6 feet
- Width (W) = 4 feet
- Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume = L x W x H = 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet

Now, we know the cost to fill the pool is $0.1 per cubic foot. To find the total cost, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot.

Total cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot = 120 x 0.1 = $12

Given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles:

1 (electric pole) : 3 (electric wires) = x (electric poles) : 45 (electric wires)

We can cross-multiply to solve for x:

1 * 45 = 3x
45 = 3x
x = 45 / 3
x = 15

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of people who left the party. We know that 1/4 of the total number of people left, and 22 men stayed. 

Let's denote the total number of people as 'x'. Since 1/4 of the people left, 3/4 of the people stayed. We can set up the equation:

3/4 * x = 22 + (number of women who stayed)

We know that the total number of people at the beginning was 25 men + 15 women = 40 people. So, x = 40.

Now, we can substitute x = 40 into the equation:

3/4 * 40 = 22 + (number of women who stayed)

30 = 22 + (number of women who stayed)

Subtract 22 from both sides:

8 = (number of women who stayed)

Since 1/4 of the people left, 1/4 of the total number of people left the party. The total number of people who left is 1/4 * 40 = 10.

We know that 22 men stayed, so the number of men who left is 40 - 22 = 18. 

The number of women who left is 10 - 18 = -8, which is not possible since we can't have a negative number of people. This means our initial assumption that 22 men stayed is incorrect.

However, we can try another approach. Let's assume that the number of men who left is 18. Then, the number of women who left is 10 - 18 = -8, which is still not possible.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. We can set up an equation to represent this: 

3x + 2 = 26, where x is the number of pencils in each box.

To find the number of pencils in each box, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: 

3x = 26 - 2
3x = 24

Now, we can divide both sides by 3 to find the value of x: 

x = 24 / 3
x = 8

So, each box contains 8 pencils. 

Now, let's find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have. Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each, which is 3 * 8 = 24 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils they have is 24 + 46 = 70.

To find the number of boxes needed to store all the pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils in each box: 

Number of boxes = Total number of pencils / Number of pencils in each box
= 70 / 8
= 8.75

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees and then calculate the total weakening effect of the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, so the number of ice cubes needed is:

65 / 13 = 5

Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, 5 ice cubes will make it 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Now, let's consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. The coffee is already 60 milliliters weaker due to the ice cubes, so adding 15 milliliters of cream will make it 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters weaker.

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio. For every 2 old records, 1 new record is given. Since 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of new records as 7. 

Now, we need to find out how many old records were traded for these 7 new records. Since the trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record, we can multiply the number of new records by 2 to find the total number of old records traded.

Total old records = 7 new records * 2 = 14

So, the 5 people brought in 14 old records.

"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we first need to find the number of junior and senior programmers, and then their respective salaries.

The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 100. 
Number of junior programmers = (2/5) * 100 = 40

Since the number of senior programmers is the remaining employees, we subtract the number of junior programmers from the total number of employees.
Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so their salary is $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

Now, we can find the total amount of money the company pays to all the junior programmers per month.
Total salary of junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers
= 40 * $2000
= $80000

And the total amount of money the company pays to all the senior programmers per month.
Total salary of senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers
= 60 * $2400
= $144000

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the total salary of junior and senior programmers.
Total amount of money = Total salary of junior programmers + Total salary of senior programmers
= $80000 + $144000
= $184000

The final answer is: $184000"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Initially, there were x people on the bus at the terminal. 

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total became x + 5.

At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, and 8 more got in. So, the total became (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6.

We are given that the total number of people at the third stop is 20. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + 6 = 20.

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it. Subtract 6 from both sides of the equation: x = 20 - 6.

x = 14.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.

He passes 14 out to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.

He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

He eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.

He eats 2 more in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to first find out how many percentage points are left to charge. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more to be fully charged.

Since the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can find the time it takes to charge 40% by multiplying 40 by 3. 

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

120 / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone. 

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to first calculate the total number of lollipops she has after her mother gives her 10 more. 

Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her 10 more, so Erin now has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.

Then, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella. To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we subtract 3 from 17. 

17 - 3 = 14

So, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

"To find out how much the customer paid, we first need to determine the rewards they earned from their last shopping trip. Since they spent $80 and get $1 off for every $20 spent, we divide $80 by $20 to find out how many rewards they earned.

$80 / $20 = 4 rewards

These rewards are worth $4, as each reward is worth $1. Now, let's consider their current shopping trip. They spent $43 and used their rewards, which is $4. They also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Twice the amount of rewards is 2 * $4 = $8.

So, the total discount they got is the sum of the rewards and the coupon discount, which is $4 + $8 = $12.

Now, let's subtract the total discount from the amount they spent to find out how much they paid.

$43 - $12 = $31

The customer paid $31 on this shopping trip.

"To determine which job pays more, we need to calculate the net pay for each job.

For Job A, the total income is $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year. The total tax is 20% of $30,000, which is 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000. The net pay for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

For Job B, the total income is $42,000. The property tax is $6,000, so the net income before taxes is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. The tax on this is 10% of $36,000, which is 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600. The net pay for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

Since $32,400 is greater than $24,000, Job B pays more. To find the difference in net pay, we subtract the net pay of Job A from the net pay of Job B: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400"

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the price of the shares after the first year and then after the second year.

Initially, Maria buys 8 shares for $8 each, so the total cost is 8 * 8 = $64.

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price, we multiply the original price by 1.5 (100% + 50% = 150%, or 1.5 as a decimal).
New price after the first year = 8 * 1.5 = $12.

The stock price decreases by 25% in the second year. To find the new price, we multiply the price after the first year by 0.75 (100% - 25% = 75%, or 0.75 as a decimal).
New price after the second year = 12 * 0.75 = $9.

Now, we multiply the new price after the second year by the number of shares to find the final value of Maria's shares.
Final value = 9 * 8 = $72.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as 'x'. Since the last group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the last group is 'x - 10'.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. 

So, we can write the equation: 
2x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms: 
3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides: 
3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3: 
x = 70

Since the last group has 'x - 10' students, we can find the number of students in the last group by substituting the value of 'x' into the expression: 
x - 10 = 70 - 10
= 60

"Let's break down the information given. Farmer Brown has a total of 60 animals, and he has twice as many chickens as cows. 

Let's denote the number of cows as 'c' and the number of chickens as '2c' (since he has twice as many chickens as cows). 

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can write the equation: c + 2c = 60. 

Combining like terms, we get 3c = 60. 

Dividing both sides by 3, we get c = 20. 

So, the number of cows is 20, and the number of chickens is 2c = 2 * 20 = 40.

Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. 

The total number of legs of the chickens is 40 * 2 = 80.

"To find out how much Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the total cost per month and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's find the cost per month. 

Food costs $25 per week, and there are 4 weeks in a month, so the cost of food per month is:
$25 * 4 = $100

Treats cost $20 per month.

Medicine costs $100 per month.

Now, let's add up the costs:
$100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:
$220 * 12 = $2640

The final answer is: $2640"
"To find the total time spent on after-work activities, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and add them up.

- Monday's yoga class is 1 hour.
- Tuesday's cooking class is 3 times as long as Monday's yoga, so it's 1 * 3 = 3 hours.
- Wednesday's cheese-tasting event is 0.5 hours (half an hour).
- Thursday's museum tour is half as long as the cooking class, so it's 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours.
- Friday's errands are 2 hours.

Now, let's add up the time spent on each activity:
1 (Monday) + 3 (Tuesday) + 0.5 (Wednesday) + 1.5 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 7.5 hours.

The final answer is: 7.5"
"To find out how many plant pots April has left over, we first need to determine the total number of plant pots she needs. 

The school asked for 30 plant pots for the daisies. Since they asked for twice as many for the roses, we multiply 30 by 2 to get the number of plant pots needed for the roses. 

30 * 2 = 60

Now, we add the number of plant pots needed for the daisies and the roses to get the total number of plant pots needed.

30 + 60 = 90

Since April had already bought 100 plant pots, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number she bought to find out how many she has left over.

100 - 90 = 10

So, April has 10 plant pots left over. 

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent from the initial amount she had. 

First, let's calculate the total amount she spent. She spent $11 on a sweater and gave her brother $4, so the total amount spent is $11 + $4 = $15.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount she had: $36 - $15 = $21.

Andrea saved $21."
"To find the total time John spent, we need to calculate the time he spent boating, swimming, and watching shows. 

He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. 

He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

We are given that this is 70% of the total time (100% - 30% for sightseeing). 

Let's set up an equation to find the total time: 0.7x = 15, where x is the total time.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 0.7: x = 15 / 0.7 = 21.43 hours.

Now, we need to find the time spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time. 

Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * 21.43 = 8.57 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8.57}$"
"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we first need to calculate how much money she has earned from both jobs. 

From her first job, she earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so she earns 10 * 20 = $200.

From her second job, she earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so she earns 5 * 15 = $75.

In total, Annabelle earns $200 + $75 = $275 from both jobs.

Since she already has $80 in her savings, we add the money she earned to her savings: $80 + $275 = $355.

The phone costs $400, so to find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we subtract the amount she has from the cost of the phone: $400 - $355 = $45.

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save $45.

The final answer is: $45"
"To find the height of the tallest tree, we first need to find the combined height of the two shorter trees. The shortest tree is 6 feet tall, and the second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so it is 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall. 

The combined height of the two shorter trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet. 

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two shorter trees combined, so it is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he spent at the toy store. 

The cost of 6 toy cars is 6 * $2 = $12. 
The cost of 5 teddy bears is 5 * $1 = $5. 
The total amount spent is $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially had $28. After spending $17, he had $28 - $17 = $11. 
His mother then gave him an extra $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost of the activities. 

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is 1 round * $5 = $5. 
Since there are 'x' friends, the total cost for mini-golf for her friends will be 1 * $5 = $5. 
The total cost for mini-golf for Morgan and her friends will be $5 + $5 = $10.

The cost of arcade tokens for Morgan and her friends is 2 * $5 = $10.

The cost of go-karts for Morgan and her friends is 2 * $10 = $20.

The total cost of all activities is $10 + $10 + $20 = $40.

Since Morgan has a budget of $90, the amount left for her friends is $90 - $40 = $50.

The total cost for her friends is $50. Since the cost for mini-golf for her friends is $5, the remaining cost for go-karts and arcade tokens for her friends is $50 - $5 = $45.

The cost of go-karts for her friends is $20. The cost of arcade tokens for her friends is $10. The remaining cost for go-karts for her friends is $45 - $10 = $35.

"To find out how much money Marisa saves in her piggy bank, we need to first calculate how much money she spends on lollipops each day and then subtract that from her daily pocket money.

Marisa buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, so the total amount she spends on lollipops each day is:
4 lollipops * 25 cents/lollipop = 100 cents or $1

Now, let's subtract the amount she spends from her daily pocket money:
$5 (pocket money) - $1 (lollipops) = $4

Since she saves this amount every day for 5 days, we multiply the daily savings by 5:
$4 * 5 = $20

So, Marisa puts $20 in her piggy bank if she saves for 5 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much change Billy has after buying the candy. 

Billy has $10 and the candy costs $1.5 per pound. Let's assume he buys x pounds of candy. The total cost of the candy will be 1.5x dollars. 

So, the change he has after buying the candy is 10 - 1.5x.

He then takes half of this change and spends it on gumballs. The cost of each gumball is $0.05, and he buys 40 gumballs. The total cost of the gumballs is 0.05 * 40 = $2.

Since he takes half of his change, the amount he spends on gumballs is (10 - 1.5x) / 2. This amount is equal to the total cost of the gumballs, which is $2.

Now, we can set up an equation to solve for x:

(10 - 1.5x) / 2 = 2

Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

10 - 1.5x = 4

Subtract 10 from both sides:

-1.5x = -6

Divide both sides by -1.5:

x = 4

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Let's break down the information given. Carver's age is 45, and it's 5 years less than twice the age of his son. 

Let's represent the son's age as 'x'. According to the information, 2x - 5 = 45. 

To find the son's age, we need to solve for 'x'. 

First, add 5 to both sides of the equation: 2x = 45 + 5
2x = 50

Next, divide both sides by 2: x = 50 / 2
x = 25

The son is 25 years old.

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to add the distances between the three cities. 

Distance from the first city to the second city = 75 miles
Distance from the second city to the third city = 100 miles
Distance from the third city to the first city = 100 - 50 = 50 miles (since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs)
Total distance in one trip = 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is:
Total daily distance = 225 miles * 3 = 675 miles

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we need to divide the total distance it travels before service by the daily distance:
Days between services = 18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.67 days

So, the train goes approximately 26.67 days between services."
"To find the amount of stuffing needed for the collie beds, we first need to find the average amount of stuffing between the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds. 

The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we need to find the total amount of stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds. 

For the chihuahua beds: 4 beds * 2 pounds per bed = 8 pounds.
For the collie beds: 3 beds * 5 pounds per bed = 15 pounds.

The total amount of stuffing needed is 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

"To find the total time taken for the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the trip and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time taken for the trip to his friend's house. The distance is 200 miles and the speed is 70 mph. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 miles / 70 mph
Time = 2.857 hours (approximately)

However, he had to take a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. So, the actual distance traveled to his friend's house is 200 + 10 = 210 miles. 

Time taken for the detour = 10 miles / 70 mph
Time taken for the detour = 0.143 hours (approximately)

Total time taken to reach his friend's house = 2.857 hours + 0.143 hours
Total time taken to reach his friend's house = 3 hours

Now, let's calculate the time taken for the trip back home. The distance is 240 miles and the speed is 80 mph.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 240 miles / 80 mph
Time = 3 hours

Total time taken for the trip = Time taken to reach his friend's house + Time taken for the trip back home
Total time taken for the trip = 3 hours + 3 hours
Total time taken for the trip = 6 hours

Now, we know that 43 out of the total 96 fourth-graders are girls. So, the number of fourth-grade boys is:
Total fourth-graders - Total girls = 96 - 43 = 53

Now, we need to find the number of fourth-grade boys present on Friday. We know that 4 boys were absent, so the number of boys present is:

"To find the total number of kids in the park, we first need to determine the number of boys. Since there are twice the number of boys as girls, and there are 6 girls, we can calculate the number of boys by multiplying the number of girls by 2.

Number of boys = 2 * Number of girls
Number of boys = 2 * 6
Number of boys = 12

Now, to find the total number of kids in the park, we add the number of girls and the number of boys.

Total number of kids = Number of girls + Number of boys
Total number of kids = 6 + 12
Total number of kids = 18

"Let's break down the information given:

1. 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 
   Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting as S. 
   We can write the equation: S = 4 * 3 - 5
   S = 12 - 5
   S = 7
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 
   Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as V. 
   We can write the equation: V = 3 * S
   V = 3 * 7
   V = 21
4. If a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, we can write the equation: 
   Total = 3 (refusing to wear masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) + X (other reasons)
   50 = 3 + 7 + 21 + X
   50 = 31 + X
   X = 50 - 31
   X = 19

The final answer is: 19"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many points Erin has now. Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, and Sara scored 8 points, we can calculate Erin's current points as follows:

Erin's current points = 3 * Sara's points
Erin's current points = 3 * 8
Erin's current points = 24

Now, we know Erin scored 14 points, so to find out how many points she had before, we need to subtract 14 from her current points:

Erin's previous points = Erin's current points - 14
Erin's previous points = 24 - 14
Erin's previous points = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total cost of the picture frames, we first need to calculate the cost of the etching. The cost of etching is 20% of the cost of the picture frame, which is $20. 

20% of $20 is 0.2 * $20 = $4. 

So, the total cost of the picture frame with etching is $20 + $4 = $24.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the picture frames for all seniors. There are 44 seniors, so the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the pins for 2 seniors. The cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Now, let's calculate the number of officers. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so the number of officers is 44 * 1/4 = 11.

The cost of the cords for the officers is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, let's add up the total cost of the picture frames, pins, and cords. The total cost is $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final answer is: $1198"
"To find the total cost of making the hand-painted wallpaper, we first need to calculate the materials cost. Since making it DIY saves 20% of the market price, we can find the materials cost by subtracting 20% of the market price from the market price.

Market price = $400
Savings = 20% of $400 = 0.20 * $400 = $80
Materials cost = Market price - Savings = $400 - $80 = $320

So, the total cost of making the hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"To find the total number of shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs on Sunday, so we need to subtract those from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday. 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add up the total number of shoes sold over the three days: 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, we multiply the total number of pairs by 2 to get the total number of shoes sold: 50 * 2 = 100.

The final answer is: 100"

"To find the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to find the value of the faulty equipment. 

The total value of the equipment is $400,000. 
40% of the equipment was faulty. 
To find the value of the faulty equipment, we multiply the total value by 40% (or 0.4).

Value of faulty equipment = $400,000 * 0.4
Value of faulty equipment = $160,000

Now, we subtract the value of the faulty equipment from the total value to find the value of the functioning equipment.

Value of functioning equipment = Total value - Value of faulty equipment
Value of functioning equipment = $400,000 - $160,000
Value of functioning equipment = $240,000

The final answer is: $240,000"
"To find out how much milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from the half of the sheep that gives 1 kg of milk and the half that gives 2 kg of milk.

First, let's find out how many sheep are in each half. Since Mary has 30 sheep, half of them would be 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

The first half gives 1 kg of milk each, so the total milk from this half would be 15 * 1 = 15 kg.

The second half gives 2 kg of milk each, so the total milk from this half would be 15 * 2 = 30 kg.

Now, let's add the milk from both halves to find the total milk collected every day. 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

"To find out how many pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we first need to determine how many rolls were left after feeding her children. 

She started with a dozen rolls, which is 12 rolls. After feeding her 6 children, she had 12 - 6 = 6 rolls left. 

Since she broke each of the remaining rolls into 8 pieces, we multiply the number of rolls left by 8. So, 6 rolls * 8 pieces per roll = 48 pieces.

Therefore, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the number of pupils who like the color yellow, we first need to find the number of pupils who like blue, then the number of pupils who like green, and finally subtract the sum of these two from the total number of pupils.

First, half of the class likes blue. So, the number of pupils who like blue is 40 / 2 = 20.

Now, one-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. The remaining pupils are 40 - 20 = 20. One-fourth of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5.

So, the number of pupils who like green is 5.

Now, the number of pupils who like yellow is the total number of pupils minus the number of pupils who like blue and green. This is 40 - 20 - 5 = 15.

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total interest she has to pay and then divide it by the number of months.

The formula to calculate simple interest is: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Given:
Principal (P) = $3,650
Rate (R) = 10% or 0.10
Time (T) = 5 months

Interest = P * R * T
= $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
= $1,825

Now, we need to add the interest to the principal to find the total amount Karan has to pay:
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
= $3,650 + $1,825
= $5,475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, we divide the total amount by the number of months:
Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Number of Months
= $5,475 / 5
= $1,095

The final answer is: $1,095"

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we first need to determine how many silver and gold pesos each of them has.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. 

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. 
Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's add up the total number of silver and gold pesos each of them has:
Axel's total: 50 (silver) + 80 (gold) = 130 pesos
Anna's total: 100 (silver) + 120 (gold) = 220 pesos

To find the total number of pesos they have together, we add Axel's total and Anna's total:
130 (Axel's total) + 220 (Anna's total) = 350 pesos

"To find the total profit per hour, we first need to find the total revenue and the total cost.

The total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make is 3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups.

Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

The total cost is $18.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $36 - $18 = $18.

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, we need to find the profit per hour. 

The profit per hour is the total profit divided by the number of hours. However, we don't know the number of hours. But we can find the profit per cup and then multiply it by the number of cups sold per hour.

The profit per cup is $18 / 36 cups = $0.5 per cup.

The profit per hour is $0.5 per cup * 4 cups per hour = $2 per hour.

"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the initial amount of land as 'x'. Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he was left with 2/5 of the initial amount. We are given that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation as follows:

2/5 * x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2 to isolate x:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land initially.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the number of female members in the choir, we first need to calculate 50% of the total members. 

50% of 52 is 0.5 * 52 = 26. 

Since there are 26 female members, and half of them can't make it to the show, we need to find half of 26. 

Half of 26 is 26 / 2 = 13.

Now, the number of female members who can make it to the show is 26 - 13 = 13. 

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is 13 + 3 = 16.

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu.

First, let's find out how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22

"To find out how much money David saves, we need to calculate the cost of the rides for Dasha and compare it to the cost of the ride bracelet for David.

Each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, so the cost of one ride is 2 * $2 = $4.

Since they ride all 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha to buy tickets for all rides is 9 * $4 = $36.

David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides. This means he doesn't need to buy any additional tickets.

The difference in cost between Dasha's ticket purchase and David's ride bracelet is $36 - $30 = $6.

David saves $6 by buying a ride bracelet instead of tickets.

"To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we first need to find out how many popsicles each of them has. 

Let's assume the number of popsicles Betty has is 5x and the number of popsicles Sam has is 6x. 

Since the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, we can write the equation: 5x + 6x = 165

Combine like terms: 11x = 165

Divide both sides by 11: x = 15

Now that we know x, we can find the number of popsicles each of them has. Betty has 5x = 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles. Sam has 6x = 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15

"To find out how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for the quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, we multiply the ingredients by 4.

For flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
For milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark will need to buy:
12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark will need to buy:
4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4

"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the original energy consumption and then subtract the new energy consumption.

Original energy consumption per day = 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (or 7.2 kilowatt-hours, since 1 kilowatt-hour = 1000 watts * 1 hour)

New energy consumption per day = 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours (or 2.7 kilowatt-hours)

Energy saved per day = Original energy consumption - New energy consumption
= 7.2 kilowatt-hours - 2.7 kilowatt-hours

"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we first need to calculate the total number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide 20 by 4 to get the total number of sandwiches needed.

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we need a total of 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so the total cost of the meat is:
5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so the total cost of the cheese is:
5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is the sum of the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese:
$35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the initial number of corns and cannolis Allan has at home. 

Since Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis and he has 40 cannolis, the initial number of corns is 2 * 40 = 80.

Allan bought 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. So, he bought 60 cannolis and 60 - 40 = 20 corns.

Now, we add the initial number of corns and cannolis to the number of corns and cannolis Allan bought. The total number of corns is 80 + 20 = 100. The total number of cannolis is 40 + 60 = 100.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 + 100 = 200.

"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first calculate the total steps he completed before the jog. 

Elliott finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since he wants to walk 10,000 steps, half of that would be 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. 

He also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. 

So, before the jog, Elliott completed 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Since he had 2,000 steps left after the jog, we can find out the total steps he took during the jog by adding the steps he completed before the jog to the steps he had left. 

6,000 (steps before jog) + 2,000 (steps left) = 8,000 steps.

Therefore, Elliott took 8,000 steps during his jog.

The final answer is: 8000"
"To find out how many minutes Toby will be early, we need to calculate the total time it takes for him to read the book and travel to the airport.

First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book: 
45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words

Since Toby can read 300 words per minute, we can calculate the time it takes for him to read the book:
9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, so the total time it takes for Toby to finish the book and get to the airport is:
30 minutes (reading time) + 10 minutes (travel time) = 40 minutes

Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, so we subtract the total time it takes for him to finish the book and get to the airport from the time he has to be there:
60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

Therefore, Toby will be 20 minutes early.

"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately and then add them together.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked for 40 hours a week and was paid $15 per hour. So, the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 hours/week * 4 weeks = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 hours * $15/hour = $2400. Since there are 40 employees, the total amount paid in May is 40 employees * $2400/employee = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 * 40 employees = 10 employees left. The remaining 10 employees worked for 40 hours a week * 4 weeks = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 hours * $15/hour = $2400. Since there are 10 employees left, the total amount paid in June is 10 employees * $2400/employee = $24,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $24,000 = $120,000.

The final answer is: $120,000"
"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means that for every 2 pounds of taffy, she pays $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound (since it's half off). So, the cost of 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. She bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total amount spent by Tim, we first need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks and the finale firework.

The first package of fireworks costs $400. The second package costs twice as much, so it's 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packages. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 0.20: $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

The discount amount is subtracted from the total cost: $1200 - $240 = $960.

The finale firework costs $150. Adding this to the discounted cost of the fireworks, we get $960 + $150 = $1110.

The total amount spent by Tim is $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To find out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we first need to determine how many cookies she eats in 30 days. 

Since Shannon eats 2 cookies a night, we multiply the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of nights in 30 days. 

There are 30 nights in 30 days. 

2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since Shannon's recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens of cookies she needs to make to have 60 cookies. 

To do this, we divide the total number of cookies she needs (60) by the number of cookies her recipe makes (12).

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen cookies

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days. 

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. 

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. 5% of 50,000 candles smell like wet dog, so we multiply 50,000 by 0.05 to get the number of candles that smell like wet dog: 50,000 * 0.05 = 2,500.

However, these candles are also the ones that are more dangerous and have a higher chance of exploding. Since Marcy guarantees that 99% of her candles will not explode, 1% of the candles are more dangerous and have a higher chance of exploding. 

We need to find 1% of the candles that smell like wet dog, which is 2,500. To do this, we multiply 2,500 by 0.01: 2,500 * 0.01 = 25.

So, 25 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to find the price of one discounted blouse. Since the blouses are 30% off, we need to find 70% of the original price.

70% of $20 is 0.7 x $20 = $14.

Since Misha picked out 4 blouses, we multiply the price of one discounted blouse by 4.

$14 x 4 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.
- The combined total of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is 30 + 60 + 15 + 45 = 150 apples.
- Since the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - 150 = 350 apples.
- Since Joanne gathers some apples from the average trees, we need to find out how many apples she gathered from the average trees. Let's denote the number of apples she gathered from the average trees as 'x'.
- The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 30 (from the tallest trees) + 15 (from the shortest trees) + x (from the average trees) = 45 + x.
- The total number of apples gathered by her sister is 60 (from the tallest trees) + 45 (from the shortest trees) = 105 apples.
- The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so 45 + x + 105 = 500.

"Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. We know that each camel has 2 humps and each dromedary has 1 hump. The total number of humps is 304, so we can write the equation:

2C + D = 304

We also know that the total number of heads (camels and dromedaries) is 180, so we can write another equation:

C + D = 180

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve for C and D by subtracting the second equation from the first:

2C + D - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know C, we can substitute it into the second equation to find D:

124 + D = 180
D = 56

So, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd.

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down the information given.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is 4 * 200 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers. So, the total distance covered in the next two days is 240 kilometers.

On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance covered is 0 kilometers.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance covered in the second week is 7 * 300 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, let's add up the distances covered in each period: 
- First 4 days: 800 kilometers
- Next 2 days: 240 kilometers
- Next 1 day: 0 kilometers
- Second week: 2100 kilometers

Total distance = 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

The final answer is: 3140"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work backwards from Peter's locker size. 

Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, Zack's locker must be 4 times as big as Peter's locker. 

Zack's locker size = 4 * Peter's locker size
Zack's locker size = 4 * 5 cubic inches
Zack's locker size = 20 cubic inches

Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, Timothy's locker must be twice as big as Zack's locker.

Timothy's locker size = 2 * Zack's locker size
Timothy's locker size = 2 * 20 cubic inches
Timothy's locker size = 40 cubic inches

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the elevation where Stanley's comb fell, we need to subtract the distance it fell from Stanley's initial elevation. 

Stanley's initial elevation: 10,000 feet
Distance the comb fell: 4,000 feet
Elevation where the comb fell: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation where the comb fell and Oliver's elevation to determine how much Oliver needs to climb.

Elevation where the comb fell: 6,000 feet
Oliver's elevation: 3,000 feet
Distance Oliver must climb: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know that the first bank gave Mr. Josue $4000. 

The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so the second bank gave him 2 * $4000 = $8000.

Now, we add the money from both banks to find the total amount of money Mr. Josue received: $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

We also know that Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital. 

To find the total capital he has now, we add the initial capital to the money he received from the banks: $5000 + $12000 = $16000.

The final answer is: $16000"
"To find the number of cats left on the rock, we first need to determine how many cats were taken away by the boats. Since there were 4 boats and each boat carried away 5 cats, the total number of cats taken away is 4 * 5 = 20.

Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. After the boats took away 20 cats, the number of cats remaining is 50 - 20 = 30.

Now, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after the mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3 and then divide by 5. 

(30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18

So, 18 cats ran after the mouse. To find the number of cats left on the rock, we subtract 18 from the remaining cats after the boats took away 20 cats.

"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different periods and calculate the cost for each period.

1. The first 6 months were $8 a month, so the cost for this period is 6 * $8 = $48.
2. The next 8 months were $12 a month, so the cost for this period is 8 * $12 = $96.
3. After that, the price increased to $14 a month. Since 2 years is 24 months, and we've already accounted for 14 months, there are 24 - 14 = 10 months left. The cost for this period is 10 * $14 = $140.

Now, let's add up the costs for each period: $48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let the cost of the jogger jeans be x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the cost of the tattered jeans is x + $6.

The total savings is $6, and Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. This means that 1/3 of the total savings is from the jogger jeans, and 2/3 of the total savings is from the tattered jeans.

We can set up the equation: (1/3) * (total savings) = savings from jogger jeans
(2/3) * (total savings) = savings from tattered jeans

Since the total savings is $6, we can substitute this value into the equations:
(1/3) * $6 = savings from jogger jeans
(2/3) * $6 = savings from tattered jeans

Simplifying the equations:
$2 = savings from jogger jeans
$4 = savings from tattered jeans

The cost of the jogger jeans is x, and the cost of the tattered jeans is x + $6. The savings from the jogger jeans is $2, so the original cost of the jogger jeans is $2 + $6 = $8. The savings from the tattered jeans is $4, so the original cost of the tattered jeans is $28 - $4 = $24.

The difference in the original cost of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $8 - $24 = -$16. However, since we are looking for how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we take the absolute value of the difference, which is $16.

The final answer is: $16"
"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then add them together.

The capacity of the 4 buses is 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
The capacity of the 6 minibusses is 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
The capacity of the 10 minivans is 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, we add the capacities together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The final answer is: 570"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many birds each type of feeder attracts and then add them up.

Lillian made 3 bird feeders, and each of them attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds. So, the homemade feeders attract 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

She bought 3 bird feeders, and each of them attracts 20 birds. So, the store-bought feeders attract 3 * 20 = 60 birds.

In total, Lillian can expect to see 90 + 60 = 150 birds in her garden each day.

"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The bagel costs $4. 
The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, which is 4 + (4 * 0.25) = 4 + 1 = $5.
The cake costs half the price of the bagel, which is 4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: 
4 (bagel) + 5 (soup) + 2 (cake) = 11

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to first determine how many cards he sold. Since he has $50 in spending cash and the ticket costs $100, he must have sold cards worth $50 to get the remaining $50. 

Since each card is sold for $1.5, the number of cards he sold is $50 / $1.5 = 33.33. However, since we can't sell a fraction of a card, we'll round down to 33 cards.

Kenny kept 1/3 of his cards, so the number of cards he kept is 1/3 of the total number of cards he started with. Let's call the total number of cards he started with 'x'. Then, the number of cards he kept is x/3.

The number of cards he sold is the total number of cards minus the number of cards he kept, which is x - x/3 = 2x/3. We already know that he sold 33 cards, so we can set up the equation:

2x/3 = 33

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 33 * (3/2)
x = 49.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a card, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can also consider that the 33 cards he sold is 2/3 of the cards he had left after keeping 1/3. So, the total number of cards he had left after keeping 1/3 is 33 * (3/2) = 49.5. 

Since 49.5 is the number of cards he had left after keeping 1/3, we can find the total number of cards he started with by dividing 49.5 by 2/3 (the fraction he kept), which is the same as multiplying by 3/2. However, we can also find the total number of cards he started with by adding the 1/3 he kept to the 49.5 cards he had left. 

49.5 / (2/3) = 49.5 * (3/2) = 74.25. 

74.25 is the total number of cards he had after keeping 1/3. To find the total number of cards he started with, we can add the 1/3 he kept to 74.25. 

74.25 + 24.75 = 99

However, this is not the correct answer. We can also find the total number of cards he started with by adding the 33 cards he sold to the 24.75 cards he kept.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, the caterer prepared enough hot dogs for half of the guests to have two hot dogs. Since there are 36 guests, half of them would be 36 / 2 = 18 guests. 

For these 18 guests, the caterer prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hot dogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog. This means that the caterer had to provide hot dogs for 40 guests, and each guest wanted 2 hot dogs. So, the total number of hot dogs needed is 40 * 2 = 80 hot dogs.

Since the caterer already had 36 hot dogs prepared, he needed to prepare 80 - 36 = 44 more hot dogs.

Now, we know that the caterer prepared enough hot dogs for 18 guests to have two hot dogs each, and he also prepared 44 more hot dogs. This means that the 44 additional hot dogs were for the remaining guests who only had one hot dog initially.

Since the caterer prepared 36 hot dogs initially, and 18 guests had two hot dogs, the remaining 18 guests only had one hot dog. The 44 additional hot dogs were for the remaining 22 guests (40 - 18 = 22) who wanted a second hot dog.

So, the 18 guests who initially had one hot dog each did not get a second hot dog.

The final answer is: 18"

"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount and then apply the 20% discount.

The total cost of the items before the discount is:
- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- 5 separate utensils: 5 x $5.00 = $25.00
Total cost before discount: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Now, we need to apply the 20% discount to the total cost. To do this, we multiply the total cost by 0.20 (which is the decimal equivalent of 20%):
$165.00 x 0.20 = $33.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final cost:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to determine how much gas was in one container. Since 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, we can divide 15 gallons by 5 to get the amount in each container.

15 gallons / 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we can convert 3 gallons to pints by multiplying 3 by 8.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George had initially. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can set up an equation to find the initial amount.

Let's denote the initial amount as 'x'. Since 1% of 'x' is $5, we can write the equation as:

0.01x = 5

To find 'x', we can divide both sides by 0.01:

x = 5 / 0.01
x = 500

So, George initially had $500.

Now, let's find out how much he spent on chips. He bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so the total cost of chips is:

3 * 0.40 = $1.20

Since he spent $5 in total, the amount he spent on candy bars is:

5 - 1.20 = $3.80

Now, we need to find out how many candy bars he bought. Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so we can divide the total amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:

3.80 / 0.75 = 5.07

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can buy 5 candy bars with $3.75 and have $0.05 left, which is not enough to buy another candy bar. Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself, so he shared 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops with his friends.

Since he shared the lollipops equally among his four friends, we need to divide the number of lollipops he shared by the number of friends. 

20 lollipops / 4 friends = 5 lollipops per friend.

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

"To find the remaining weight of the cake, we first need to find out how much the cake weighed after Rory and her mom each had a piece. 

Since there are 8 pieces in total and Rory and her mom each had one, that's 2 pieces taken out. 

So, the remaining pieces are 8 - 2 = 6 pieces.

Now, to find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to divide the total weight of the cake by the number of pieces it was cut into, and then multiply it by the number of remaining pieces.

The total weight of the cake is 20 ounces, and it was cut into 8 pieces. 

20 ounces / 8 pieces = 2.5 ounces per piece.

Now, multiply the weight per piece by the number of remaining pieces: 
2.5 ounces * 6 pieces = 15 ounces.

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, Bernadette's drive will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, she needs to leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne.

However, we are asked how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, not how long before she arrives. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to leave 21 - 4 = 17 minutes earlier than Wayne.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the perimeter of Billie's room, we first need to find the width of the room. Since the area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = length * width, we can rearrange the formula to find the width: width = area / length.

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so 3 yards is equal to 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Now, we can find the width: width = 360 / 9 = 40 feet.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2 * (length + width). Plugging in the values, we get P = 2 * (9 + 40) = 2 * 49 = 98 feet.

The final answer is: 98"
"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads they bought. 

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has 1 * 20 + 2 * 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 beads.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has 3 * 20 + 4 * 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth. To do this, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has: 140 - 60 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the final temperature of the house, we need to calculate the temperature increase due to the oven and the temperature decrease due to the open window.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour, and Marcus bakes for 3 hours. So, the total temperature increase is 5 * 3 = 15 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the open window. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, the total cooling time is 30 / 10 = 3 intervals of 10 minutes. So, the total temperature decrease is 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

Now, let's subtract the temperature decrease from the temperature increase: 15 - 6 = 9 degrees.

The initial temperature of the house was 40 degrees. So, the final temperature is 40 + 9 = 49 degrees.

The final answer is: 49"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took James to complete each part of the triathlon. 

Let's start with the swim. Since James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, we need to find 10% of Jon's swim time and subtract it from Jon's swim time. 

10% of 40 minutes is 0.1 x 40 = 4 minutes. 

So, James' swim time is 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

Next, we know that James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. Jon's bike time is 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes. 

So, James' bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, we know that Jon won by 10 minutes. This means that the difference between Jon's total time and James' total time is 10 minutes. 

Let's denote James' run time as x. 

Jon's total time is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes. 

James' total time is 36 + 85 + x. 

The difference between their times is 10 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

170 - (36 + 85 + x) = 10

Simplifying the equation, we get:

170 - 121 - x = 10

49 - x = 10

x = 39

So, it took James 39 minutes to complete the run.

The final answer is: 39"
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then divide it by 4.

Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so it is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so it is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

First, let's find out how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is half an hour. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32 MPH * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, and it ran 16 miles, the total hay consumed is:
Total Hay = 16 miles * 1/2 bail/mile
Total Hay = 8 bails

Each bail costs $3, so the total cost of the hay is:
Total Cost = 8 bails * $3/bail
Total Cost = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:
Total Money = 6 * $5
Total Money = $30

Now, let's find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay:
Change = Total Money - Total Cost
Change = $30 - $24
Change = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total, we need to calculate the number of eggs from the cases and the loose eggs separately. 

4 dozen eggs is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 eggs. 
Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Since each glass needs 5 eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs by 5 to find out how many glasses of eggnog Rozanne can make. 
50 eggs / 5 eggs per glass = 10 glasses.

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, so we can divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays Rozanne can put out. 
10 glasses / 5 glasses per tray = 2 trays.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many points Joey is winning by, we need to calculate the difference between his final score and Marcy's final score.

"To find the salesman's profit, we first need to calculate the total revenue from the flash sale and the department store sales.

The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each at the flash sale, so the total revenue from the flash sale is:
17 * $20 = $340

The salesman sold the remaining 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers to the department store for $25 each. The total revenue from the department store sales is:
31 * $25 = $775

The total revenue from both sales is:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The cost of the case of 48 sneakers is $576. To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the total revenue:
$1115 - $576 = $539

The salesman's profit is $539.

The final answer is: $539"

6 packets * 8 crayons/packet = 48 crayons

Next, let's calculate the total number of crayons in the four packets with sixteen pieces each:
4 packets * 16 crayons/packet = 64 crayons

Now, let's add the total number of crayons from both types of packets:
48 crayons + 64 crayons = 112 crayons

So, Beatrice bought a total of 112 crayons for her Art class.

112"
"Let's break down the information given. 

If you buy a super ticket for $20 and get a popcorn and a soda for $1 extra, the total cost would be $21. 

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the total cost of buying a regular ticket and a popcorn and a soda would be $21 - $2 = $19.

You already know the cost of the regular ticket is $12. So, the cost of the popcorn and the soda would be $19 - $12 = $7.

The cost of the soda is $3. So, the cost of the popcorn would be $7 - $3 = $4.

The regular price of popcorn is $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as 'x'. Since the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, we can set up the equation:

20x = 900

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

x = 900 / 20
x = 45

So, the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost of filling one balloon is:

New cost = Original cost + Increase
New cost = 45 + 20
New cost = 65

Now, we need to find the total cost of filling 170 balloons at the new rate:

Total cost = New cost per balloon * Number of balloons
Total cost = 65 * 170
Total cost = 11050

The final answer is: 11050"
"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 mph x 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 mph x 1 hour
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's find the total distance traveled:
Total Distance = 120 miles + 30 miles
Total Distance = 150 miles

The total time taken is the sum of the time taken at 60 mph and 30 mph:
Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour
Total Time = 3 hours

Now, we can calculate the average speed:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average Speed = 50 mph

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires and rubies separately and then add them together.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. Each sapphire is worth $800, so the total value of her sapphires is:
8 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $6400

Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. This means she now has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left. The value of the sapphires remains the same, $6400.

The value of the 2 rubies she received in the trade is:
2 rubies * $1200/ruby = $2400

Now, we add the value of the sapphires and rubies together:
$6400 (sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $8800

The total value of Jenna's jewels is $8800.

$8800"
"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of apples they eat per day and then multiply it by 30.

Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. So together, they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples per day.

Now, we multiply the total number of apples they eat per day by 30 to find the total number of apples they eat in 30 days: 8 * 30 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds. 

The volume of one raised bed is calculated as length * width * height. 
Volume = 2 feet * 8 feet * 2 feet = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:
Total Volume = 32 cubic feet * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. To find the number of bags needed, we divide the total volume by the volume of one bag:
Number of bags = Total Volume / Volume per bag = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag = 160 bags * $12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of cards, we first need to determine the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of red cards = 15
60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39

"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add the number of puppies Jennifer's dog has to the number of puppies Brandon's dog has. 

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. 
Total puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies that have spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. 
Total puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies that have spots by dividing the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and add them together.

The total weight of sugar cubes is 2 boxes * 1 pound per box = 2 pounds.

The total weight of carrots is 4 bags * 12 pounds per bag = 48 pounds.

The total weight of hay is 42 bales * 75 pounds per bale = 3150 pounds.

The total weight of oats is 20 sacks * 65 pounds per sack = 1300 pounds.

The total weight of all the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds.

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight of the feed by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips needed.

3400 pounds / 2250 pounds per trip = 1.51 trips.

Since we can't make a fraction of a trip, the farmer will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the total earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the earnings from aluminum cans. Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week. Since an aluminum can is worth 2 cents, her weekly earnings from aluminum cans are 3 * 2 = 6 cents. 

For a four-week month, her earnings from aluminum cans would be 6 * 4 = 24 cents.

Next, let's calculate the earnings from plastic bottles. Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week. Since a plastic bottle is worth 3 cents, her weekly earnings from plastic bottles are 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

For a four-week month, her earnings from plastic bottles would be 15 * 4 = 60 cents.

Now, let's add the earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles together. 24 cents (aluminum cans) + 60 cents (plastic bottles) = 84 cents.

"Let's break down the problem. Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is 'x'. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be represented as 0.5x + 2.

Since Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, we can set up the equation: 0.5x + 2 = 5.

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: 0.5x = 5 - 2, which simplifies to 0.5x = 3.

Next, divide both sides of the equation by 0.5 to solve for 'x': x = 3 / 0.5.

"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert their individual lengths to feet and then add them together. 

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 6 inches to feet by dividing by 12. 

6 inches / 12 = 0.5 feet

Since there are two remoras, we multiply the length of one remora by 2.

0.5 feet * 2 = 1 foot

Now, we add the length of the remoras to the length of the shark.

10 feet (shark) + 1 foot (remoras) = 11 feet

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy, we divide the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100.

First, let's find the total number of employees: 
There are 3 groups of 200 employees each, so the total number of employees is 3 * 200 = 600.

Next, let's find the total number of tour guides: 
There are 3 groups, and each group has 7 tour guides, so the total number of tour guides is 3 * 7 = 21.

Now, let's add the total number of employees and tour guides to find the total number of people going on the tour: 
600 (employees) + 21 (tour guides) = 621.

The final answer is: 621"
"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than normal, so the new price is 1.2 * $1500 = $1800 per day. Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel, which is $10,000 + $5400 = $16,400.

The final answer is: $16,400"
"To find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to calculate the number of tubes of blue paint and yellow paint he has.

Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint. Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, so Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint. Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so Jasper has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

To find the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we add the number of blue and yellow tubes: 2 (blue) + 9 (yellow) = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to find the weight of the 2010 penny. 

Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight by multiplying the weight of the 1959 penny by 3/4.

Weight of 1959 penny = 48 grains
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48 grains
Weight of 2010 penny = 36 grains

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their individual weights.

Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny
Combined weight = 48 grains + 36 grains
Combined weight = 84 grains

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how much more they need to earn, we need to calculate the total amount they have already earned and subtract that from their goal.

Keegan earned $83 and Tasha earned $91, so together they earned $83 + $91 = $174.

They need to earn $26 more to reach their goal.

The final answer is: $26"
"To find out how many songs Luri can add to his player, we need to first find out how many songs he already has. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, Luri has 3 * 20 = 60 songs.

Now, we need to find out how many songs each can add to their player. Since each player can store up to 100 songs, Gabriel can add 100 - 20 = 80 songs, and Luri can add 100 - 60 = 40 songs.

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add than Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add: 80 - 40 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we first need to find out how many oranges he ate. Since Stetson ate 2/5 of the oranges and they picked 60 oranges, we can calculate the number of oranges he ate as follows:

Number of oranges eaten = (2/5) * 60
= (2 * 60) / 5
= 120 / 5
= 24

Now that we know Stetson ate 24 oranges, we can find the total amount of money he gave up by multiplying the number of oranges eaten by the amount he gave up for each orange, which is $10.

Total amount given up = Number of oranges eaten * Amount per orange
= 24 * 10
= 240

The final answer is: $240"
"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we need to first calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes. 

Cost of shoes = $80
3 times the cost of shoes = 3 * $80 = $240

Since the handbag cost $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes, we subtract $20 from $240.

Cost of handbag = 3 times the cost of shoes - $20
Cost of handbag = $240 - $20
Cost of handbag = $220

The final answer is: $220"
"To find out how many hours James runs a week, we need to first calculate the total miles he runs in a week. 

James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week, so the total miles he runs in a week is 12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week.

Since James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour, we can find the total hours he runs in a week by dividing the total miles by his speed. 

Total hours = Total miles / Speed
Total hours = 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour
Total hours = 6 hours/week

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in a day. 

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and he feeds them twice a day. So, each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has four horses, the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in a day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in five days. This is 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats. To find out how many bags Uncle Ben needs, we divide the total amount of oats consumed in five days by the amount in each bag: 200 / 50 = 4.

So, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the number of girl Pomeranians, we first need to find the total number of Pomeranians. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can calculate this as follows:

Total puppies = 27
Pomeranians = (2/3) * Total puppies
Pomeranians = (2/3) * 27
Pomeranians = 18

Now, we need to find the number of girl Pomeranians. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can calculate this as follows:

Girl Pomeranians = (1/3) * Pomeranians
Girl Pomeranians = (1/3) * 18
Girl Pomeranians = 6

First, let's add up the temperatures: 
-48 (Southlandia) + 21 (Northlandia) + (-3) (Midlandia) = -30

Now, let's divide the sum by 3:
-30 / 3 = -10

The average highest temperature of the three countries is -10 degrees Fahrenheit."
"To find out how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we need to first calculate the remaining amount he needs to save. 

The toy car costs $12, and he already has $4. So, the remaining amount he needs to save is $12 - $4 = $8.

He promises to save $2 daily from his allowance. To find out how many days it will take to save $8, we can divide the remaining amount by the daily savings:

$8 / $2 = 4

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money. 

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we need to calculate the total capacity of the trays and subtract the number of eggs he has.

Each tray can hold 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays. So, the total capacity of the trays is 24 * 2 = 48 eggs.

Jaime has 64 eggs, but the trays can only hold 48 eggs. To find out how many eggs won't fit, we subtract the capacity from the total number of eggs: 64 - 48 = 16.

So, Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the tray.

"To find the cost of each individual razor after the discount, we need to first calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon.

Since the razors are buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. 

Heather also has a $2.00 coupon, so she will get a discount of $2.00.

The total cost of 1 pack of razors after the coupon is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, the cost of each individual razor is $2.00 / 4 = $0.50.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents.

"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each level and add them up.

The 4 girls on the bottom are 64"" tall each, so their total height is 4 * 64 = 256"".

The 3 girls on top of the 4 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 3 * 64 = 192"".

The 2 girls on top of the 3 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 2 * 64 = 128"".

The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, we add up the heights of all the levels: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 536"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 536"" / 12 = 44.67 feet.

"To find the total number of minutes Charisma walked, we need to calculate the total number of 5-minute breaks she took in a day and then multiply it by the number of days she worked.

Charisma works 8 hours a day, and she takes a 5-minute break every hour. So, the total number of 5-minute breaks in a day is 8 hours * 1 break per hour = 8 breaks per day.

Since each break is 5 minutes long, the total number of minutes she walked in a day is 8 breaks * 5 minutes per break = 40 minutes per day.

Charisma worked for 5 days, so the total number of minutes she walked is 40 minutes per day * 5 days = 200 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know that in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is 14 years old now, in four years, he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.

We are told that in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. So, in four years, Angela's age will be 3 * 14 = 42 years old.

Since we know Angela's age in four years, we can find her current age by subtracting 4 from 42. 

Angela's current age = 42 - 4 = 38 years old.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides separately, and then add them together.

The cost of the morning rides is the cost per ride multiplied by the number of rides. Since Paul drives twice a day for 14 days, he drives a total of 2 * 14 = 28 rides in the morning. The cost per ride is $6, so the total cost of the morning rides is 28 * $6 = $168.

The cost of the afternoon rides is also the cost per ride multiplied by the number of rides. Since Paul drives twice a day for 14 days, he drives a total of 2 * 14 = 28 rides in the afternoon. The cost per ride is $2, so the total cost of the afternoon rides is 28 * $2 = $56.

To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we add the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides: $168 + $56 = $224.

The final answer is: $224"
"To find out how many Greek orange pies they can make, we first need to determine the total number of oranges they have. 

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so she has 5 * 10 = 50 oranges. 

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges. 

In total, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges. 

Since one Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, we can divide the total number of oranges by 3 to find out how many pies they can make: 120 / 3 = 40. 

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the costs for each venue.

For the first venue, the cost is a flat fee of $200, plus $5 per guest. If there are x guests, the total cost for the first venue is $200 + $5x.

For the second venue, the cost is $25 per guest. If there are x guests, the total cost for the second venue is $25x.

Since we want the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up the equation:

$200 + $5x = $25x

To solve for x, we can subtract $5x from both sides of the equation:

$200 = $20x

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by $20 to solve for x:

x = $200 / $20
x = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's denote the number of insects David found as D, the number of insects Bodhi found as B, and the number of insects Lily found as L. 

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so we can write an equation: L = D + 7.

We also know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can write another equation: D = B/2.

We are also given that together they collected 43 insects, so the sum of the insects they found is L + D + B = 43.

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the third equation: (D + 7) + D + B = 43.

Combine like terms: 2D + B + 7 = 43.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2D + B = 36.

Now, substitute the second equation into the result: 2(D) + B = 36 becomes 2(B/2) + B = 36.

Simplify the equation: B + B = 36.

Combine like terms: 2B = 36.

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18.

Now that we know B, we can find D: D = B/2 = 18/2 = 9.

Now that we know D, we can find L: L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16.

"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to calculate the yards used by Mariah and her grandma separately and then add them together.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein. To find 1/4 of 364, we multiply 364 by 1/4.

364 * 1/4 = 364 * 0.25 = 91 yards

Mariah used 91 yards of yarn.

Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein, which is the same as 2/4. To find 2/4 of 364, we multiply 364 by 2/4.

364 * 2/4 = 364 * 0.5 = 182 yards

Her grandma used 182 yards of yarn.

Now, we add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma together.

91 + 182 = 273 yards

They used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

"To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the total number of gifts for her friends and add the 10 random gifts.

First, let's calculate the total number of gifts for her friends. 2 friends want 5 gifts each, so that's 2 x 5 = 10 gifts. The other 3 friends want 2 gifts each, so that's 3 x 2 = 6 gifts. 

Now, let's add the gifts for her friends: 10 + 6 = 16 gifts.

Then, we add the 10 random gifts: 16 + 10 = 26 gifts.

So, Cherrie bought a total of 26 gifts.

"Let's break down the information given. Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total. She bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, 1 pack of grape gum for $2, and 1 pack of green apple gum. 

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as 'x'. Since she paid half as much for the green apple gum as the grape gum, the cost of the green apple gum is $2 / 2 = $1.

The total cost of all the gum is $7. So, the total cost of the strawberry gum and the green apple gum is $7 - $2 = $5. 

Since there are 2 packs of strawberry gum, the total cost of the strawberry gum is 2x. The total cost of the green apple gum is $1. Therefore, 2x + $1 = $5.

To find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we need to solve for x. Subtracting $1 from both sides of the equation gives us 2x = $4. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us x = $2.

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2. 

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives him the most sticks per dollar spent. 

Let's calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood:

For a 2 x 4, Frederick can get 200 sticks for $4. 
Cost per stick = $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick

For a 2 x 8, Frederick can get 400 sticks for $6. 
Cost per stick = $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick

Since the 2 x 8 costs less per stick, Frederick should buy the 2 x 8 wood to maximize the number of popsicle sticks.

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with his $24:

Number of 2 x 8 pieces = $24 / $6 = 4

Since each 2 x 8 piece gives 400 sticks, the total number of sticks Frederick can make is:

Total sticks = 4 * 400 = 1600

The final answer is: 1600"
"To find the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs, we first need to determine the total number of snowshoes required. Since each dog has 4 legs and Mario has 6 dogs, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24.

Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, and each pair has 2 snowshoes, the total number of snowshoes required is 24 / 2 = 12.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of snowshoes by the cost per pair, which is $12.00. 

Total cost = 12 * $12.00 = $144.00

The final answer is: $144.00"
"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week and then subtract the cost of the weekly pass.

Janet takes two bus trips a day, five days a week. So, the total number of bus trips in a week is 2 trips/day * 5 days/week = 10 trips/week.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost of her bus trips for a week is 10 trips/week * $2.20/trip = $22/week.

If she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save $22/week - $20/week = $2/week.

"Let's break down the information given:

- The farm has 30 cows.
- The zoo has 20 sheep.
- The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.
- The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.
- The zoo has 20 sheep and 60 cows, so the zoo has a total of 20 + 60 = 80 animals.
- The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, so the farm has a total of 30 + 10 = 40 animals.

To find the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo, we add the number of animals in the farm and the zoo: 40 + 80 = 120.

"Let's break down the information given. We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can represent the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought as x.

The total number of onions and potatoes Rose bought is 12 + 4 = 16. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can set up the equation 4x = 16.

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 16 / 4 = 4.

So, Sophia bought 4 onions and 4 potatoes. 

The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 4 + 4 = 8."
"To find the number of days Andy has to reach his goal, we need to calculate the difference between his birthday and today's date.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. We also know that the house cost three times as much as the lot. 

Let's represent the cost of the lot as 'x'. Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house can be represented as 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write the equation: x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms: 4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4: x = 30,000

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house. The cost of the house is 3x, which is 3 * 30,000 = 90,000.

"To find the profit, we first need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The total cost is the cost of the canvas bags, which is 8 packs * 5 bags per pack * $4 per bag = 8 * 5 * 4 = $160.

The total revenue is the selling price of the bags, which is 8 bags * $8 per bag = 8 * 8 = $64.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $64 - $160 = -$96. However, since profit cannot be negative, it seems there's an error in the problem. Assuming the problem is meant to be a positive profit, let's re-evaluate the problem.

If we assume the total revenue is actually higher than the total cost, we can re-calculate the profit. However, given the information, the only logical conclusion is that the total revenue is less than the total cost, resulting in a negative profit.

"To find the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to calculate the total time of the fight and multiply it by the average punches per minute.

The fight lasts for 5 rounds of 3 minutes each, so the total time is 5 * 3 = 15 minutes.

Since Joe throws 25 punches per minute, the total number of punches is 15 * 25 = 375.

The final answer is: 375"
"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we first need to determine how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can calculate Josh's cookies as follows:

Josh's cookies = Suzanne's cookies / 4
Josh's cookies = 36 / 4
Josh's cookies = 9

Now that we know Josh made 9 cookies, we can find out how many Kelsie made. Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, so we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

The final answer is: 18"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has. He has 4 $10 bills and 6 $20 bills. 
   Total money = (4 * $10) + (6 * $20) 
   Total money = $40 + $120 
   Total money = $160

2. Now, Ali gives his sister half of the total money. 
   Half of the total money = $160 / 2 
   Half of the total money = $80

3. After giving his sister half of the money, Ali has the remaining amount. 
   Remaining money = Total money - Half of the total money 
   Remaining money = $160 - $80 
   Remaining money = $80

4. Now, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining money to buy dinner. 
   Money used for dinner = (3/5) * Remaining money 
   Money used for dinner = (3/5) * $80 
   Money used for dinner = $48

5. Finally, we need to find the amount of money Ali has after buying the dinner. 
   Money left after dinner = Remaining money - Money used for dinner 
   Money left after dinner = $80 - $48 
   Money left after dinner = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Rob to shingle a house in minutes. Since Rob takes 2 hours, we need to convert this to minutes. 

1 hour = 60 minutes
2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. Let's first find out what double the time it takes Rob is. 

Double the time it takes Rob = 2 * 120 = 240 minutes

Now, we add 40 minutes to this to find out how long it takes Royce. 

Time it takes Royce = 240 + 40 = 280 minutes

"To find the total number of skeins of wool needed, we need to calculate the total for each item and then add them together.

For each child, Martha needs:
- 2 skeins for a hat
- 4 skeins for a scarf
- 12 skeins for a sweater
- 1 skein for a pair of mittens
- 2 skeins for a pair of socks

Total skeins for each child: 2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2 = 19

Since there are 3 children, we multiply the total skeins for one child by 3:
19 * 3 = 57

So, Martha will need 57 skeins of wool in total.

The final answer is: 57"
"To find out how many math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we need to calculate the total number of problems he completed and subtract that from the initial total.

On Monday, Chris completed 12 problems. 
On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems.
So, in total, Chris completed 12 + 36 = 48 problems on Monday and Tuesday.

The total number of problems Chris had initially was 100. 
After completing 48 problems, he has 100 - 48 = 52 problems left.

On Wednesday, Chris completed one-quarter of the remaining math problems, which is 52 / 4 = 13 problems.
So, after completing 13 problems on Wednesday, Chris has 52 - 13 = 39 problems left to complete on Thursday.

"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour, we need to calculate the number of quarts each of them can pick per hour and then add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Now, let's add the number of quarts each of them can pick per hour: 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29.

Now, let's subtract the number of loaves sold and returned from the total number of loaves baked:
200 (total loaves baked) - 132 (loaves sold) - 6 (loaves returned) = 62

The bakers had 62 loaves of bread left.

"To find the number of rows of red tulips, we divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row: 36 / 6 = 6 rows.

To find the number of rows of blue tulips, we divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row: 24 / 8 = 3 rows.

Since the question asks for the total number of rows, we add the number of rows of red tulips and blue tulips: 6 + 3 = 9.

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we first need to determine how many cups of raisins she has available for the oatmeal cookies. 

Since she divides the raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, we can divide the total number of cups of raisins by 3. 

Total cups of raisins = 27
Cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies = Total cups of raisins / 3
Cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies = 27 / 3
Cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies = 9

Now, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make with 9 cups of raisins. Each batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. 

Number of batches = Cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies / Cups of raisins per batch
Number of batches = 9 / (3/4)
To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal.
Number of batches = 9 * (4/3)
Number of batches = 12

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we first need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device.

Before adding the new device, Ada's daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, her daily consumption in dollars is:
12 kilowatts/hour * $1.50/kilowatt/hour = $18/day

Her weekly consumption before adding the new device is:
$18/day * 7 days/week = $126/week

After adding the new device, her daily consumption will be:
12 kilowatts/hour + 2 kilowatts/hour = 14 kilowatts/hour

Her daily consumption in dollars after adding the new device is:
14 kilowatts/hour * $1.50/kilowatt/hour = $21/day

Her weekly consumption after adding the new device is:
$21/day * 7 days/week = $147/week

The difference in her weekly electric bill is:
$147/week - $126/week = $21/week

The final answer is: $21"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how long it would take one person to paint a whole house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take them 10 days to paint a whole house (since it's twice the amount of work).

Now, let's calculate the total hours it would take one person to paint a whole house. There are 24 hours in a day, so:

10 days * 24 hours/day = 240 hours

Since one person can paint a whole house in 240 hours, we can divide this by the number of people to find out how long it would take 5 people to paint a whole house. 

240 hours / 5 people = 48 hours

So, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

The final answer is: 48"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.
4. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have:
Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, so she has 20 + 22 = 42 pieces of furniture.
Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs, so she has 64 + 66 = 130 pieces of furniture.
The total number of sofas and chairs they have is 42 + 130 = 172.

The final answer is: 172"
"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought, we first need to find out how many CDs he could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set. 

Let's denote the number of CDs Tom bought as 'x' and the number of headphones as 'y'. We know that the total cost is $48, and the cost of one CD is $4. 

The total cost equation is: 4x + y = 48

We also know that Tom bought one CD, so x = 1. 

Substituting x = 1 into the equation, we get: 4(1) + y = 48
4 + y = 48
y = 44

This means the headphone set cost $44. 

Now, we need to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with $44. 

Let's denote the number of CDs he could have bought as 'z'. The cost equation is: 4z = 44
Dividing both sides by 4, we get: z = 11

So, Tom could have bought 11 CDs with the money he spent on the headphone set. 

Since Tom already bought 1 CD, the number of additional CDs he could have bought is: 11 - 1 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to consider the different scenarios where he spent more or less time than the usual 4 hours per week.

First, let's calculate the total hours if Josh had spent 4 hours every week for 8 weeks:
8 weeks * 4 hours/week = 32 hours

However, there were two instances where he spent more time. He spent 5 hours for two consecutive weeks, which is 2 * 5 = 10 hours. He also spent 6 hours in one week, which adds 6 hours to the total.

Now, let's subtract the hours he spent less than 4 hours from the total hours he would have spent if he had worked out 4 hours every week. Since he spent 5 hours for two weeks, he spent 2 hours less in those weeks. So, we subtract 2 * 2 = 4 hours from the total.

The total hours he spent working out is:
32 hours - 4 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours = 44 hours

The final answer is: 44"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (which is 8) get into the bus. So, 5 * 8 = 40 people get in. Now, the total number of people on the bus is:
40 (remaining) + 40 (new passengers) = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
80 - 21 = 59

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. Since 21 got off, 3 times fewer would be 21 / 3 = 7. So, 7 passengers get in. Now, the total number of people on the bus is:
59 (remaining) + 7 (new passengers) = 66

The final number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is 66."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.
2. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. 
   Jame's age in 8 years will be 22 + 8 = 30 years.
   Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60 years.
   So, Jame's cousin's age in 8 years will be 60 - 5 = 55 years.
3. Since Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, his current age is 55 - 8 = 47 years.

Now, let's find the difference in their current ages: 47 (cousin's age) - 22 (Jame's age) = 25 years.

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break down the information given. 

The total cost of the items is $2,400. The computer costs $1,100. 

Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, the cost of the printer is $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer, which is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. 

To find the cost of the two monitors, we subtract the cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

Since there are two monitors, we divide the cost of the two monitors by 2 to find the cost of one monitor: $600 / 2 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many shells the boys brought in total. Since there are 10 boys (half of 20 kids) and each brought 60 shells, the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + 4 * 60 shells. 

First, we calculate 4 times the number of shells brought by the boys: 4 * 60 = 240.

Then, we add this to the number of shells brought by the boys: 600 + 240 = 840.

Since there are 10 girls (half of 20 kids), we need to find out how many shells each girl brought. To do this, we divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by the number of girls: 840 / 10 = 84.

The final answer is: 84"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, let's assume the number of candies George had before eating 5 candies is 'x'. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, the number of candies Nick had is 2x.

George ate 5 candies, so the number of candies George has left is x - 5. We are given that George has 3 candies left, so we can set up the equation:

x - 5 = 3

To solve for x, we add 5 to both sides of the equation:

x = 3 + 5
x = 8

Now that we know George had 8 candies initially, we can find the number of candies Nick had, which is 2x:

Number of candies Nick had = 2x
= 2 * 8

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188

The final answer is: 188"
"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we need to calculate the total number of vlogs she has already made and subtract that from the target of 72.

Emma made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. 

Total vlogs made = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Since Emma's target is 72 vlogs per month, we subtract the total vlogs made from the target:

72 - 54 = 18

Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month.

"To find the total amount you paid, first, calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill. 

20% of $50 is calculated as 0.20 * $50 = $10.

Now, add the tip to the original bill: $50 + $10 = $60.

Since your wife wants to split the check evenly, you will pay half of the total amount: $60 / 2 = $30.

The final answer is: $30"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money the eldest boy initially received. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, we divide $18 by 3 to find the initial share of the eldest boy.

Initial share of the eldest boy = $18 / 3 = $6

The eldest boy added $5 to his share, so his new total is:

$6 + $5 = $11

The following day, he added another $10, making his total:

$11 + $10 = $21

Then, he spent $8 from his total, leaving him with:

$21 - $8 = $13

After saving some more, he tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8. To find the final amount, we multiply $13 by 3:

$13 * 3 = $39

So, the eldest boy now has $39."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much Elvis needs to save in the first half of the month. 

Let's assume the number of days in the first half of April is x. Since April has 30 days, the number of days in the second half will also be x.

The total savings for the month is $1125. 

The savings in the first half is x * y, where y is the daily savings in the first half. The savings in the second half is x * 2y (twice as much as the first half).

The total savings equation is: x * y + x * 2y = 1125

Combine like terms: 3xy = 1125

Divide both sides by 3x: y = 1125 / (3x)

Since we don't know the value of x, we need to find a way to express x in terms of a known value. We know that the total number of days in April is 30, so x + x = 30. 

Combine like terms: 2x = 30

Divide both sides by 2: x = 15

Now that we know x, we can substitute it into the equation for y: y = 1125 / (3 * 15)

y = 1125 / 45

y = 25

So, Elvis needs to save $25 per day in the first half of the month.

To find the daily savings in the second half, we multiply the daily savings in the first half by 2: 25 * 2 = 50

The final answer is: $50"
"To find the total cost of the fruits, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of 3 apples at $1.50 each is 3 x $1.50 = $4.50.
The cost of 5 oranges at $0.80 each is 5 x $0.80 = $4.
The cost of 6 peaches at $0.75 each is 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4.50 + $4 + $4.50 = $13.

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is $20 - $13 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we need to calculate the total amount each of them will get and then find the difference.

Jairus gets $0.8 for each task, and he finished 20 tasks. So, his total earnings will be 0.8 * 20 = $16.

Jenny gets $0.5 for each task, and she also finished 20 tasks. So, her total earnings will be 0.5 * 20 = $10.

Now, let's find the difference between Jairus' and Jenny's earnings: 16 - 10 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, and the total amount they have to divide is $100.

Let's represent the amount Brad gets as 'x'. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x.

The total amount they have to divide is $100, so we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Now, divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Since x represents the amount Brad gets, and Jeff gets 4 times as much, Jeff gets 4x:

Jeff gets 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.

The final answer is: $80"
"To find the total miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he walks in a day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

Since Jeff walks to work and back each day, the total miles he walks in a day is 2 times the distance to work, which is 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles.

Now, we multiply the daily miles by the number of days he works in a week: 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the process step by step.

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, which means she writes 26 letters each time. So, in total, she writes 26 * 2 = 52 letters.

2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of the alphabet is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.

3. So, in total, she has written 52 + 13 = 65 letters so far.

4. Now, she re-writes everything she has already written. This means she re-writes 65 letters.

5. To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we add the letters she re-wrote to the total she had before: 65 + 65 = 130.

The final answer is: 130"
"This problem can be solved using the concept of exponential growth. In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families being notified. 

In the third round, each of the 9 families (from the second round) calls 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families being notified. 

Now, we need to find the number of families notified in the fourth round. In the third round, there were 9 families who made calls. Each of these 9 families will call 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families being notified in the fourth round. However, we also need to consider the families that were notified in the previous rounds. 

In the first round, 3 families were notified. In the second round, 9 families were notified. In the third round, 27 families were notified. So, the total number of families notified in the third round is 3 + 9 + 27 = 39. 

In the fourth round, each of the 39 families (from the previous rounds) will call 3 other families, resulting in 39 * 3 = 117 new families being notified. However, we also need to consider the families that were notified in the previous rounds. 

In the first round, 3 families were notified. In the second round, 9 families were notified. In the third round, 27 families were notified. In the fourth round, 117 families were notified. So, the total number of families notified in the fourth round is 3 + 9 + 27 + 117 = 156.

"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost and then add that to his final weight.

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so the total weight he lost is:
10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Now, we add the total weight lost to his final weight to find his initial weight:
Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Jonathan needs to have a play set five times larger than James's. Since James has 80 toys, a play set five times larger would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys.

Since Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a play set five times larger than James's, let's call the number of toys Jonathan currently has ""x"". Then, the equation would be x + 2 = 400.

To find the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we need to solve for x. Subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation gives us x = 400 - 2.

x = 398

The final answer is: 398"
"To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we first need to calculate the cost of each item without the discount. 

The cost of 5 notebooks at $1.50 each is 5 x $1.50 = $7.50.
The cost of 2 pens at $0.25 each is 2 x $0.25 = $0.50.
The cost of 1 calculator at $12 each is $12.
The cost of 1 geometry set at $10 each is $10.

Now, we add the costs of all the items together: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

Since the shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
10% of $30 is 0.1 x $30 = $3.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $30 - $3 = $27.

So, Daniel has to spend $27 on all the items he wants to buy.

The final answer is: $27"

Commission for the first $1000: 30% of $1000 = 0.3 * $1000 = $300

Commission for the sales over $1000: $2500 - $1000 = $1500
Additional commission for the sales over $1000: 10% of $1500 = 0.1 * $1500 = $150

Total commission: $300 + $150 = $450

So, Antonella earned $450.

"To find out how many bottles Bill already has, we need to multiply the number of cases by the number of bottles in each case. 

2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles

Since Bill wants 2 bottles for each of his 70 guests, we need to multiply the number of guests by the number of bottles per guest.

70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

To find out how many more bottles Bill needs, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs.

140 bottles (needed) - 48 bottles (already has) = 92 bottles

So, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water. 

The final answer is: 92"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. 

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. Since it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile in cold water, twice that time is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. Adding 2 minutes to that gives us 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water. 

In cold water, it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile, so to swim 3 miles it will take him 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.

In warm water, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile, so to swim 3 miles it will take him 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

Now, we need to find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm and cold water. 

The difference is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many cups of coffee Juan currently drinks. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, and Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, we need to know the daily recommended amount of coffee.

Let's assume the daily recommended amount of coffee is x cups. Then, Octavia drinks x/2 cups of coffee. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups of coffee.

We are given that Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. To find out how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we need to subtract the recommended amount from his current intake:

Current intake: 5x cups
Recommended intake: 4 cups

Reduction needed: 5x - 4 cups

However, we don't know the value of x, the daily recommended amount of coffee. To find the reduction, we need to know the value of x. 

But, we can express the reduction in terms of x. 

Reduction needed: 5x - 4 cups

Since we don't have the value of x, we can't provide a numerical answer. However, we can express the reduction in terms of x.

But, if we assume the daily recommended amount of coffee is 4 cups, then x = 4. 

Reduction needed: 5x - 4 = 5(4) - 4 = 20 - 4 = 16 cups

But this is incorrect because we assumed x = 4. 

If we assume the daily recommended amount of coffee is 8 cups, then x = 8.

Reduction needed: 5x - 4 = 5(8) - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36 cups

But this is incorrect because we assumed x = 8.

If we assume the daily recommended amount of coffee is 2 cups, then x = 2.

Reduction needed: 5x - 4 = 5(2) - 4 = 10 - 4 = 6 cups

This is the correct answer."

"To find the average weight of the three friends, we first need to find their individual weights. 

Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds. 
Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so Susan's weight is 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. 
Bob's weight is twice as much as Susan's, so Bob's weight is 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we have the weights of all three friends: Mark (150 pounds), Susan (130 pounds), and Bob (260 pounds). 

To find the average weight, we add their weights and divide by 3. 
Average weight = (150 + 130 + 260) / 3 
Average weight = 440 / 3 
Average weight = 146.67

Assuming each child needs a number of candles equal to their age, James needs 12 candles for the older son and 8 candles for the younger son. 

Total candles needed = 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. 

Number of packs = Total candles / Candles per pack = 20 / 5 = 4 packs.

In the first week, she read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Now, we know she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes, we need to first find out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 105 minutes. 

105 minutes / 1.5 minutes per interval = 70 intervals

Since she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, she can read 2 pages per interval. So, in 70 intervals, she can read 70 * 2 = 140 pages in the first week.

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages. 

So, in two weeks, she read 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. So, the cost of bread for 1 sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30. 

The cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00. So, the cost of cheese and condiments for 1 sandwich is $30.00 / 10 = $3.00.

The total cost for 1 sandwich is $0.30 (bread) + $3.00 (cheese and condiments) = $3.30.

The revenue from selling 1 sandwich is $7.00.

The net profit for 1 sandwich is $7.00 (revenue) - $3.30 (cost) = $3.70.

First, we find the total number of small pieces of crayons: 
3 boxes * 64 crayons per box = 192 crayons

Since each muffin tin contains 8 small pieces of crayons, we divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find the number of muffin crayons:
192 crayons / 8 crayons per muffin = 24 muffin crayons

Now, we can find the total amount of money Kate can make by multiplying the number of muffin crayons by the price of each muffin crayon:
24 muffin crayons * $1.50 per muffin = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the area of the bedroom and then calculate the cost of the new carpet, padding, and installation.

The area of the bedroom is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the new carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 * $12 = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 * $2 = $432.

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removing the old carpet is 216 * $4 = $864.

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installing the new carpet is 216 * $34 = $7344.

The total cost of replacing the carpet is the sum of the cost of the new carpet, padding, removing the old carpet, and installing the new carpet: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11332.

The final answer is: $11332"
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw over the week and divide it by the number of days.

First, let's add up the total number of birds Mack saw:

Day 1 and 2: 50 birds
Day 3: 0 birds
Day 4 and 5: 120 birds
Day 6: 20 birds
Day 7: 90 birds

Total number of birds = 50 + 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 230

There are 7 days in a week. To find the average, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days:

Average number of birds per day = Total number of birds / Number of days
= 230 / 7
= 32.86

The final answer is: 32.86"
"To find the final value of the number train, we need to follow the given operations step by step.

1. The starting value of the number train is 20.
2. Half of the starting value is 20 / 2 = 10.
3. The starting value plus half the number is 20 + 10 = 30.
4. The resulting value is divided by 5, so 30 / 5 = 6.
5. The resulting value is multiplied by the starting value minus 12, so 6 * (20 - 12) = 6 * 8 = 48.

The final value of the number train is 48."
"To find the total number of cards they have together, we first need to determine how many cards each of them has. 

The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards than he has, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, to find the total number of cards they have together, we add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has: 5 + 2 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the percentage by which the oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, and then divide it by the set temperature.

The difference between the actual and set temperature is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees.

The percentage by which the oven is off is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Since the oven is off by 4% for any recipe, we need to find the temperature that is 4% less than 520 degrees.

First, we find 4% of 520: 0.04 * 520 = 20.8.

Then, we subtract 20.8 from 520 to get the temperature Maggie should set: 520 - 20.8 = 499.2.

The final answer is: 499.2"
"To find the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to add the length of each movie in minutes. 

First, let's convert the length of the first movie to minutes: 1 hour is 60 minutes, so 1 hour and 30 minutes is 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.

Next, let's convert the length of the second movie to minutes: 2 hours is 120 minutes, and adding 5 minutes to that gives us 125 minutes.

Now, we add the lengths of the two movies together: 90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

The total time Max will spend watching the two movies is 215 minutes.

"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's house price. 

30% of $76,000 is 0.3 x $76,000 = $22,800.

Now, subtract $22,800 from $76,000 to find the value of Juan's house: $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.

The value of Juan's house is $53,200.

To find the combined value of the two houses, add the value of Juan's house to Herb's house price: $53,200 + $76,000 = $129,200.

The final answer is: $129,200."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 + 20 = 60 dishes.

To find the total number of cups, we add Judy's cups and her friend's cups: 12 + 40 = 52 cups.

To find the total number of dishes, we add Judy's dishes and her friend's dishes: 24 + 60 = 84 dishes.

The total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by the two is the sum of the total cups and total dishes: 52 + 84 = 136.

The final answer is: 136"
"To find the cost per pair of contacts, we first need to find the total number of contacts in 2 boxes and the total cost of 2 boxes with the discount.

Since 90 contacts last 45 days, we can find the number of contacts per day by dividing 90 by 45. 

90 contacts / 45 days = 2 contacts per day

Since there are 2 contacts per day, in 2 boxes (which is 180 contacts), the contacts will last 90 days.

Now, let's find the total cost of 2 boxes with the 10% discount. 

Original price of 2 boxes = 2 * $100 = $200
Discount = 10% of $200 = 0.1 * $200 = $20
Price after discount = $200 - $20 = $180

Now, let's find the cost per pair of contacts. Since 180 contacts will last 90 days, the number of pairs per day is 180 / 2 = 90 pairs per day.

Cost per pair = Total cost / Total pairs per day
Cost per pair = $180 / 90 pairs per day
Cost per pair = $2

The final answer is: $2"
"To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate their individual earnings first.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, for a total of 3 hours. Her hourly wage is $10, so her total earnings are 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

John's total earnings are 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how much water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories she burns during her activities. 

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from aerobics is 2 * 500 = 1000 calories.

She also spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from running is 1 * 600 = 600 calories.

The total calories burned is the sum of calories burned from aerobics and running, which is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units she burned. 

Total calories burned / 200 = 1600 / 200 = 8

Since she needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we multiply the number of 200-calorie units by 100 to find the total water she needs to drink.

8 * 100 = 800 ml

The final answer is: 800"
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G. 

From the given information, we have the following equations:

1. R = 0.99B (1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans)
2. G = 1.01B (1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans)
3. B + R + G = 4500 (total number of jelly beans)

Substituting the first two equations into the third equation, we get:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500
Combine like terms:
3B = 4500
Divide both sides by 3:
B = 1500

Now that we have the value of B, we can find the values of R and G:

R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to first find the third measurement. 

Jared's initial typing speed is 47 WPM. After some lessons, it increases to 52 WPM. If he continues to increase his typing speed once more by 5 words, his new typing speed will be 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, we have the three measurements: 47, 52, and 57. To find the average, we add them up and divide by 3.

Average = (47 + 52 + 57) / 3
Average = 156 / 3
Average = 52

"To find the total number of people attending, we need to calculate the number of people invited via email, the number of friends Alex's friends will bring, and the number of Alex's friends and their spouses.

First, let's calculate the number of people invited via email. Each of the 100 people invited will bring 2 friends, so the total number of people invited via email is 100 + (100 * 2) = 300.

Next, Alex calls 10 friends and 8 of them will bring their spouses, so the total number of Alex's friends and their spouses is 10 + 8 = 18.

Now, we add the number of people invited via email and the number of Alex's friends and their spouses to get the total number of people attending. 

Total number of people = 300 + 18 = 318

However, we also need to include Alex herself, so the total number of people attending is 318 + 1 = 319.

Therefore, Alex will need 319 seats.

"To find the total cost of the boots on eBay, we need to add the cost of the boots and the shipping cost. 

The cost of the boots on eBay is $13. 
The shipping cost on eBay is twice as much as on Amazon, which is 2 * $4 = $8.

So, the total cost of the boots on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, let's find the total cost of the boots on Amazon. 
The cost of the boots on Amazon is $16. 
The shipping cost on Amazon is $4.

So, the total cost of the boots on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay.
$21 - $20 = $1.

Let's calculate the height of the beanstalk for each day:

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 4: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

As we can see, on the 4th day, the beanstalk will be taller than Mark's window, which is 20 feet off the ground.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we first need to find out how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein percentage in a cup of mushrooms by dividing the protein by the weight: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 or 3%.

Now, we know that John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we multiply the weight of mushrooms he eats by the protein percentage: 200 grams * 0.03 = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to find the weekly protein intake: 6 grams/day * 7 days = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's break down the information given. If Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can represent his current age as 'x'. 

Five years ago, Jerry's age would be 'x - 5'. According to the problem, Jerry's current age is twice his age 5 years ago, so we can write the equation as:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting '2x' from both sides gives us:

-x = -10

Multiplying both sides by -1, we get:

x = 10

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years. 

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

"To find out how many hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. 

The base price for 2 implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. 
For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost for the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500. 
However, since he's getting two implants, he will need two crowns, so the total cost for the crowns is 2 * $500 = $1000. 
The total cost for the dental work is $4500 + $1000 = $5500. 

George has already put down a deposit of $600. So, he still needs to pay $5500 - $600 = $4900.

Since he makes $15 per hour at work, to find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $4900 / $15 = 326.67 hours.

The final answer is: 327"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as 'x'. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it's 2x. The other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it's 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

One angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
The other angle is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

First, let's convert the quarters to cents: 8 quarters * 25 cents = 200 cents
Next, let's convert the dimes to cents: 6 dimes * 10 cents = 60 cents
Then, we already have the nickels in cents: 14 nickels * 5 cents = 70 cents
Lastly, we have the pennies in cents: 15 pennies * 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has: 200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs a nickel (5 cents), we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball: 345 cents / 5 cents = 69

Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"To find the rate at which the plane is traveling, we need to divide the distance it traveled by the time it took. 

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we need to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this rate.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Since the question asks for the additional hours it would take, we need to subtract the initial 3 hours from the total time.

Additional Time = Total Time - Initial Time
Additional Time = 5 hours - 3 hours
Additional Time = 2 hours

"To find out how much Marissa makes in an hour, we need to first find out how much Ruiz makes in an hour. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, we divide 120 by 2 to get the amount he makes in an hour.

Ruiz's hourly production = 120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour.

Now, we know Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours. So, we multiply Ruiz's 2-hour production by 3/4 to find Marissa's hourly production.

Marissa's hourly production = (3/4) * 120 = 90 pounds per hour.

Now, we know both Ruiz and Marissa's hourly production. We need to find their combined production for 12 hours.

Combined production per hour = Ruiz's production + Marissa's production = 60 + 90 = 150 pounds per hour.

Now, we multiply their combined production per hour by the number of hours they worked to find the total production.

Total production = 150 * 12 = 1800 pounds.

"To find out how much money Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is $25 + $35 = $60.

Since there's a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount. To do this, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage (30% or 0.3). The discount amount is $60 * 0.3 = $18.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost of the items. $60 - $18 = $42.

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to add any additional tax to the final cost. Joe will pay $42 for the items.

To find out how much money Joe will have left, we subtract the final cost from the initial amount of money he has. $50 - $42 = $8.

"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants he wants to make in a week. Since he wants to make 4 dozen a day for 7 days, we multiply 4 dozen by 7.

4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can convert 28 dozen to the total number of croissants:

28 dozen * 12 croissants/dozen = 336 croissants

Now, we know it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find out how much butter is needed for 336 croissants, we first need to convert the number of croissants to dozens:

336 croissants / 12 croissants/dozen = 28 dozen

Now, we can multiply the number of dozens by the amount of butter needed per dozen:

28 dozen * (1/4 pound/dozen) = 28 * 0.25 = 7 pounds

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 336 croissants.

"To find the total cost of John's research, we first need to determine the total number of months it took for the research to be completed. Since it took 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, the total duration is 5 * 10 = 50 months.

The initial 5 months cost $100,000. After that, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the cost for each of the remaining 45 months (50 - 5 = 45) is 1.5 times the initial cost.

The cost for the first 5 months is $100,000. The cost for the remaining 45 months is 45 * $100,000 * 1.5 = $6,750,000.

The total cost is the sum of the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining 45 months: $100,000 + $6,750,000 = $6,850,000.

The final answer is: $6,850,000"
"To find the total amount of meat consumed, we need to calculate the amount eaten by the first, second, and third players. 

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak. 
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so 8 ounces of beef tips. 
The third player ate a one-pound steak, which is equal to 16 ounces (1 pound = 16 ounces).

Now, let's add up the total amount of meat consumed: 
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to calculate the total number of posts per day and then multiply it by the number of days in March.

There are 31 days in March. 

Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day. Since there are 1000 members, the total number of posts per day is 1000 * 3 = 3000 posts.

Now, we multiply the total number of posts per day by the number of days in March: 3000 * 31 = 93,000.

The final answer is: 93000"
"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to calculate the total amount of water used in a year and then multiply it by the cost of a gallon of water.

Gary does laundry twice a week, so in a year (52 weeks), he does laundry 2 * 52 = 104 times.

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so in a year, Gary uses 104 * 20 = 2080 gallons of water.

Since a gallon of water costs $0.15, the total cost of water for laundry in a year is 2080 * $0.15 = $312.

The final answer is: $312"
"To find the total amount Scarlett spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

"To find the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks, we need to calculate its height at the end of each week and add the growth from each week.

At the end of the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.

At the end of the second week, it doubled in height, so it became 3 * 2 = 6 inches tall.

At the end of the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so it became 6 + 4 = 10 inches tall.

Therefore, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 weeks.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to calculate the total amount of meat Prince sells in a day and then divide the total weight of the bull by that amount.

Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, so he sells 15 * 10 = 150kg of meat per day.

The bull weighs 750kg. To find out how many days it will take to sell the meat, we divide the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince sells per day: 750 / 150 = 5.

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of students, we first need to find the total number of seats occupied by the administrators, parents, and students.

Total seats in the auditorium = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. 
Administrators = 1/4 * 72 = 18 seats

Remaining seats = 72 - 18 = 54 seats

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. 
Parents = 1/3 * 54 = 18 seats

Remaining seats (for students) = 54 - 18 = 36 seats

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium = 36 seats.

"To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to add the number of times each DVD has already been played to the number of times each can be played before breaking, and then add those two totals together.

DVD 1 has been played 356 times and can be played 1000 times before breaking, so it can be played 1000 - 356 = 644 more times.

DVD 2 has been played 135 times and can be played 1000 times before breaking, so it can be played 1000 - 135 = 865 more times.

Now, we add the number of times each DVD can be played before breaking to the number of times each has already been played: 356 + 644 + 135 + 865 = 2000.

The final answer is: 2000"

John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks, and each week he went twice for 2 hours at a time. So, the total number of hours he attended therapy is:

6 weeks * 2 sessions per week * 2 hours per session = 24 hours

The cost per hour is $125. Therefore, the total cost of the physical therapy is:

24 hours * $125 per hour = $3000

The final answer is: $3000"
"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim chews during school, we need to calculate how many 2-hour intervals are in an 8-hour school day. 

8 hours / 2 hours per interval = 4 intervals

Since Jim chews 1 piece of gum per 2-hour interval, he chews 4 pieces of gum during school.

He also chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.

In total, Jim chews 4 (during school) + 2 (on the way home and after dinner) = 6 pieces of gum.

Jim started with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

However, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 7.

So, Jim gives 7 pieces to his sister and has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces left.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find out how old Charmaine will be 4 years from now, we need to first determine her current age. Since she will be 16 years old in 12 years, we subtract 12 from 16 to find her current age.

16 (future age) - 12 (years until then) = 4 (current age)

Now, we add 4 years to her current age to find out how old she will be 4 years from now.

4 (current age) + 4 (years from now) = 8

So, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we need to calculate the total amount spent by each coach and then find the difference.

The baseball coach bought 9 new baseballs for $3 each, so the total amount spent by the baseball coach is:
9 x $3 = $27

The basketball coach bought 8 new basketballs for $14 each, so the total amount spent by the basketball coach is:
8 x $14 = $112

$112 - $27 = $85

The final answer is: $85"
"To find the total number of flowers that have bloomed, we first need to find the total number of flowers in the garden. Since there are 10 rows with 20 flowers in each row, we multiply the number of rows by the number of flowers in each row.

Total flowers = 10 rows * 20 flowers/row = 200 flowers

Since only 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed, we need to find 4/5 of the total number of flowers.

Number of bloomed flowers = (4/5) * Total flowers
= (4/5) * 200
= 0.8 * 200
= 160

The final answer is: 160"
"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb/s to Mb/s. Since 1 Mb has 1000 kb, we can divide her speed by 1000 to get the speed in Mb/s.

20 kb/s / 1000 = 0.02 Mb/s

Now, we need to convert this speed from Mb/s to Mb/h. There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we can multiply her speed in Mb/s by 3600 to get the speed in Mb/h.

0.02 Mb/s * 3600 s/h = 72 Mb/h

So, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb/h.

"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to calculate the difference between the required height (4 feet) and Adam's current height (40 inches), and then divide that by his growth rate (2 inches per year).

First, let's convert the required height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 4 feet is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 inches.

Now, let's calculate the difference between the required height and Adam's current height: 48 inches - 40 inches = 8 inches.

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we can divide the difference by his growth rate to find out how many years it will take for him to reach the required height: 8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To find out how much James made, we first need to calculate the profit from each car. 

The cost of each car to the company is 30% of $25,000, which is 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500. 
The selling price of each car is $25,000. 
The profit from each car is $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

James got a 10% commission on the profits, which is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

So, James made $17,500."
"To find the number of men who can stay upright, we first need to find the total number of riders who can stay upright. 

Given that 25% of the riders can stay upright, and there are 100 riders, we can calculate the number of riders who can stay upright as follows:

25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25

Now, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women. To find the number of women, we can calculate:

60% of 25 = 0.6 * 25 = 15

Since the remaining riders who can stay upright are men, we can find the number of men by subtracting the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

25 - 15 = 10

Therefore, 10 men can stay upright on the wave.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we first need to find the price of the gold and silver jewels.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, and the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold, so we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp and add them together.

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps, we add the number of each type of stamp together: 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the relative speed between Bob and Tom. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed to get the relative speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph
Relative speed = -15 mph

However, since speed cannot be negative, we need to take the absolute value of the relative speed.

Relative speed = | -15 mph | = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed to find the time it will take for Tom to catch up with Bob.

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we need to first determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate Darren's catch by subtracting 6 from Naomi's total.

Darren's catch = Naomi's catch - 6
Darren's catch = 17 - 6
Darren's catch = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can find out how many Tommy caught by adding 3 to Darren's total.

Tommy's catch = Darren's catch + 3
Tommy's catch = 11 + 3
Tommy's catch = 14

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to determine the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's assume the cost per class is $10. If Manny attends all 10 classes, the total cost would be 10 classes * $10 per class = $100. However, he signed up for $60, so he has a remaining balance of $40.

Since his parents won't sign him up again if the cost exceeds $10 per class, we need to find out how many classes he can miss to stay within the $60 budget. 

Let's subtract the cost of the classes he attends from the total budget: $60 - $10x = $0 (where x is the number of classes attended).

Solving for x, we get: x = $60 / $10 = 6 classes.

Since there are 10 total classes, Manny can miss 10 - 6 = 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total weekly production, we first need to determine the daily production of Julie and Jewel, and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day.

The total daily production of both Jewel and Julie is 50 + 100 = 150 customers per day.

To find the total weekly production, we multiply the daily production by 7: 150 * 7 = 1050.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to first determine how many miles Reggie ran. We know Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, and Paisley ran 4 miles. So, Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

We also know Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. This means Reggie's total miles minus 3 is equal to Lynn's miles. So, Lynn's miles = Reggie's miles - 3. 

Now, we can substitute Reggie's miles into the equation: Lynn's miles = 20 - 3 = 17.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to find the cost of one apple and one orange. 

The cost of 4 apples is $5.20, so the cost of one apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30. 

The cost of 3 oranges is $3.30, so the cost of one orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Now, we can find the cost of 5 apples: 5 apples * $1.30/apple = $6.50.

Next, we can find the cost of 5 oranges: 5 oranges * $1.10/orange = $5.50.

Finally, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges: $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we can multiply the volume by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot.

Time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the features and the base price:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

"To find out how much Tim will make in a year, we first need to calculate his new monthly salary and the bonus.

His new monthly salary is a 5% raise on his current $20,000 salary. 
5% of $20,000 is 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000. 
So, his new monthly salary is $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000.

The bonus is half a month's salary, which is $21,000 / 2 = $10,500.

Now, let's calculate his total monthly income: 
$21,000 (new monthly salary) + $10,500 (bonus) = $31,500.

To find out how much he will make in a year, we multiply his total monthly income by 12:

"To find the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, then add those times together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil. Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil, and he needs to dig 24 feet of soil. 

Time to dig through soil = Total soil depth / Rate of digging through soil
Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour
Time to dig through soil = 6 hours

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay. Bill can dig half as fast through clay as he can through soil, so his rate of digging through clay is 4 / 2 = 2 feet/hour. He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

Time to dig through clay = Total clay depth / Rate of digging through clay
Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour
Time to dig through clay = 4 hours

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay to find the total time.

Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours
Total time = 10 hours

"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on each day and then subtract the two amounts.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got a $2 discount. So, the total cost is:
20 * $20 = $400
Discount: $2
Total cost = $400 - $2 = $398

On the second day, the price shot to $30 per fruit, and a 10% discount was offered on the total cost. Sheila bought 20 pomegranates. 
Total cost = 20 * $30 = $600
Discount: 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Total cost = $600 - $60 = $540

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

In the first month, Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Let's denote the total sales from green hats as G. Then, the sales from red hats is 400, and we can write the equation:

400 = 0.5G

To find the total sales from green hats, we can multiply both sides by 2:

G = 400 * 2
G = 800

So, the total sales from green hats in the first month is $800. The total sales in the first month is the sum of sales from red and green hats:

Total sales in the first month = 400 + 800 = $1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. Let's calculate the sales in the second month:

Sales in the second month = 3/4 * 1200
Sales in the second month = 900

The total amount she made in two months is the sum of sales in the first and second months:

Total amount in two months = 1200 + 900 = $2100

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of paid hours and the cost for each hour.

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so he only paid for 3 hours.

The first paid hour costs $15. Each hour after that costs twice the cost of the first hour, which is 2 * $15 = $30.

So, the cost for the second hour is $30 and the cost for the third hour is $30.

The total cost is $15 (first hour) + $30 (second hour) + $30 (third hour) = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To find out how much was withheld from Sally's wage, we need to determine how much she should have had in her account if she received her full wage. 

Her weekly wage is $300, and she started with $200. So, if she received her full wage, her account should have $200 (initial amount) + $300 (weekly wage) = $500.

However, her account now holds $420. To find out how much was withheld, we subtract the current amount from the expected amount: $500 (expected amount) - $420 (current amount) = $80.

So, $80 was withheld from Sally's wage.

The final answer is: $80"
"To find out how many deviled egg halves Lori's guests will eat, we multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat. 

Number of guests: 16
Number of deviled egg halves per guest: 3

Total deviled egg halves: 16 * 3 = 48

Since Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many deviled egg halves 1 egg can make. 

1 egg makes 2 deviled egg halves

Now, we divide the total number of deviled egg halves needed by the number of deviled egg halves 1 egg can make.

Total deviled egg halves needed: 48
Deviled egg halves per egg: 2

Number of eggs needed: 48 / 2 = 24

Since we need to find out how many dozens of eggs Lori needs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (1 dozen = 12 eggs).

Number of eggs needed: 24
Number of eggs in a dozen: 12

Number of dozens of eggs needed: 24 / 12 = 2

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many pages Shiela has left to write, we need to calculate 2/3 of the total pages since she has already finished 1/3 of the paper.

The total number of pages is 15. 

2/3 of 15 can be calculated as (2/3) * 15 = (2 * 15) / 3 = 30 / 3 = 10.

So, Shiela has 10 pages left to write.

10"
"To find out how many days it will take Mike to finish reading the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read per day.

Total pages = 200
Pages read per day = 10

Days to finish reading = Total pages / Pages read per day
Days to finish reading = 200 / 10
Days to finish reading = 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we need to subtract the number of days it will take him to finish reading from the total number of days.

Days before deadline = Total days - Days to finish reading
Days before deadline = 30 - 20
Days before deadline = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the cost of the plane itself, the hanger rental, and the fuel costs.

The cost of the plane is $150,000.

The hanger rental is $5000 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total hanger rental cost for the first year is:
$5000 * 12 = $60,000

The fuel cost is twice the hanger rental, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month. The total fuel cost for the first year is:
$10,000 * 12 = $120,000

Now, we add the cost of the plane, the hanger rental, and the fuel costs to find the total cost:
$150,000 (plane) + $60,000 (hanger rental) + $120,000 (fuel) = $230,000

The total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is $230,000.

$230,000"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. It took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice.
2. It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so it took her 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook pork.
3. Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of 80 is 40 minutes.

Now, let's add up the cooking times for all the food: 
- Rice: 30 minutes
- Pork: 50 minutes
- Beans: 40 minutes

Total cooking time = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost of each mixture, we need to calculate the cost of almonds and walnuts separately and then combine them.

For the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- Cost of almonds: 1/2 pound * $10/pound = $5
- Cost of walnuts: 1/3 pound * $15/pound = $5
- Total cost of the first mixture: $5 + $5 = $10

For the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- Cost of almonds: 1/5 pound * $10/pound = $2
- Cost of walnuts: 1/3 pound * $15/pound = $5
- Total cost of the second mixture: $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
Difference = Cost of the first mixture - Cost of the second mixture
Difference = $10 - $7
Difference = $3

The final answer is: $3"
"Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. We know that sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. 

We can set up two equations based on the given information:

1. The total number of animal legs: 4S + 2G = 70
2. The total number of animal heads: S + G = 20

We can solve the second equation for G: G = 20 - S

Now, substitute G in the first equation: 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70

Expand the equation: 4S + 40 - 2S = 70

Combine like terms: 2S + 40 = 70

Subtract 40 from both sides: 2S = 30

Divide both sides by 2: S = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the coffee. 

Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, and he wants a week's worth, which is 7 days. The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound. 

So, the cost of the normal brand of coffee for a week would be 7 * $5 = $35.

However, the more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand. To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we need to calculate 20% of $5 and add it to $5.

20% of $5 is 0.2 * $5 = $1. 
So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

The cost of the more expensive brand for a week would be 7 * $6 = $42.

Roger also buys a donut for $2.

The total cost would be the cost of the more expensive brand plus the cost of the donut: $42 + $2 = $44.

The final answer is: $44"
"To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to subtract the total cost of the items Gus bought from the total amount he spent. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought:

2 bags of chips for $2.00 each: 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
Adding the cost of the bucket of fried chicken: $4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00
Adding the cost of the bottle of soda: $12.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's subtract the total cost of the items from the total amount Gus spent:

Total amount spent: $20.00
Total cost of items: $13.00
Cost of the apple pie: $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The cost of the apple pie is $7.00."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered.

Total newspapers delivered = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered - (Newspapers delivered to District A + Newspapers delivered to District C)
= 600 - (198 + 209)
= 600 - 407
= 193

The final answer is: 193"
"To find out how many recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total class time and then divide it by the time it takes to learn a new recipe.

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so the total class time per week is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

Since the class lasts for 6 weeks, the total class time is 8 hours/week * 6 weeks = 48 hours.

John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. To find out how many recipes he learns, we need to divide the total class time by 1.5 hours.

Total recipes learned = Total class time / Time to learn a new recipe
= 48 hours / 1.5 hours

"To find the number of math teachers, we first need to find the number of history teachers and then subtract that from the total number of teachers. 

60% of 150 teachers are history teachers. To find 60% of 150, we multiply 150 by 0.6. 

150 * 0.6 = 90

So, there are 90 history teachers. To find the number of math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers.

150 - 90 = 60

There are 60 math teachers. 

Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours they sleep per day.

60 * 6 = 360

The final answer is: 360"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Aurelia has $120.
2. Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia. 
   Kassidy's money = (3/4) * Aurelia's money = (3/4) * 120 = 90 dollars.
3. Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy.
   Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + 60 = 90 + 60 = 150 dollars.

Now, let's find the total amount of money they have together:
Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
Total money = 120 + 90 + 150
Total money = 360 dollars

If they decide to share this money equally among themselves, each person will get:
Money per person = Total money / 3
Money per person = 360 / 3
Money per person = 120 dollars

"To find the total length of the game, we need to calculate the length of the regular game and then add the extra time played in the extended quarter.

The regular game consists of 4 quarters, each 12 minutes long. So, the total length of the regular game is:
4 quarters * 12 minutes/quarter = 48 minutes

Since the game was extended for 5 minutes, we need to add this to the total length of the regular game:
48 minutes + 5 minutes = 53 minutes

Therefore, the entire game lasted for 53 minutes.

First, let's find the number of management employees. 20% of 50 employees are management. 

20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10

Now, we need to find 30% of the management employees who oversee the company.

30% of 10 = 0.3 * 10 = 3

So, 3 employees oversee the company.

Robert had 3 pounds of candy, Cindy had 5 pounds of candy, and Aaron had 4 pounds of candy. 

Total candy = 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds

Since they are sharing the candy equally among themselves, we need to divide the total candy by the number of people. 

Number of people = 3 (Robert, Cindy, and Aaron)

Candy per person = Total candy / Number of people
= 12 / 3
= 4

So, each of them would have 4 pounds of candy after sharing.

"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to first determine the total number of good days recorded by Christina. We know that she had 12 good days in the first 30 days. However, we also know that her first 8 days were good, her second 8 days were bad, and her third 8 days were neutral. 

So, the good days in the first 24 days are already accounted for (8 good days in the first 8 days and 4 good days in the last 3 days). This means that the 12 good days mentioned earlier include these 12 good days. 

Now, we need to find the number of good days in the remaining 6 days of the month. We know that Christina had 12 good days in total, and 12 good days are already accounted for.

Therefore, the total number of good days in the first 30 days is 8 + 3 = 11. However, we know that Christina had 12 good days in the first 30 days. This means that there must be 1 more good day in the first 30 days. 

Since we know that the first 24 days are already accounted for, the remaining good day must be in the last 6 days. However, we are given that the next three days were good, neutral, and good. This means that the last 3 days are already accounted for. Therefore, the remaining good day must be in the first 3 days of the last 6 days. 

However, we are given that the first 8 days were good, and the next 3 days were good. This means that the first "
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Janey has 21 books and that she has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. 

Let's represent the number of books Sally has as 'x'. According to the information, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, so we can write an equation:

Janey's books = 2 * Sally's books + 3
21 = 2x + 3

Now, we need to solve for 'x'. To do this, we'll subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

21 - 3 = 2x + 3 - 3
18 = 2x

Next, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate 'x':

18 / 2 = 2x / 2
9 = x

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we need to first convert the initial height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we multiply 20 feet by 12 inches per foot.

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we know the bamboo grows 30 inches a day and it's currently 240 inches tall. To find out how many days it will take to reach 600 inches, we subtract the current height from the target height and divide by the daily growth rate.

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Now, we divide the remaining height by the daily growth rate.

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

So, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. This means each dog has 1 toy. When 8 more dogs arrive, James needs 8 more toys to bring the total to 12 dogs with 1 toy each. So, he buys 8 more toys.

Now, there are 12 dogs, and James goes back to find that there are twice as many more dogs, which means there are 2 * 8 = 16 more dogs. This makes the total number of dogs 12 + 16 = 28. Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 28 more toys.

However, when James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys. This means he needs 28 - 3 = 25 more toys.

Initially, James had 4 toys. He bought 8 more toys, then 28 more toys, and finally, he needs 25 more toys. So, the total number of toys he needs is 4 + 8 + 28 + 25 = 65.

The final answer is: 65"
"To find out how much money Skyler invested, we need to calculate the remaining amount after Dylan and Frances' investments.

First, let's find out how much Dylan invested. Dylan's investment is 2/5 of the total amount, which is 2/5 * $1200 = $480.

Now, let's find out how much money is left after Dylan's investment. The remaining amount is $1200 - $480 = $720.

Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, which is 2/3 * $720 = $480.

Now, let's find out how much money is left after Frances' investment. The remaining amount is $720 - $480 = $240.

Skyler's investment is the remaining amount, which is $240.

The final answer is: $240"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many signatures the sisters have in total and then subtract that from their goal of 100 signatures.

Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. 

Total signatures collected so far = 20 + 44 = 64

The sisters have three more weeks of summer vacation. Since they want to reach 100 signatures by the end of the summer, we need to find out how many signatures they need to collect in the remaining three weeks.

Signatures needed to reach the goal = 100 - 64 = 36

So, the sisters need to collect 36 signatures in the remaining three weeks to reach their goal."
"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we first need to determine her hourly wage. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Karen works in two days. Since she works 3 hours per day, in two days she works 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we can multiply Karen's hourly wage by the number of hours she works to find her total earnings: $20 * 6 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we need to determine the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. 

Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can calculate the ratio as follows: 

36 hash browns / 6 potatoes = 6 hash browns per potato

Now, we can multiply this ratio by the total number of potatoes to find the total number of hash browns that can be made:

6 hash browns per potato * 96 potatoes = 576 hash browns

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

"To find out how much the elevator will exceed its maximum load, we first need to calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults. 

Jack's weight is not given, but we know the average weight of an adult is 80 kg. Since there are 9 adults (Jack and 8 others), we multiply the average weight by the number of adults: 80 kg * 9 = 720 kg.

Now, we subtract the total weight of the adults from the maximum load of the elevator to find out how much they will exceed the limit: 700 kg - 720 kg = -20 kg.

However, since we can't have a negative weight, this means they will not exceed the maximum load. But if we want to know by how much they will exceed the limit, we can say they will not exceed it, or we can say they will be 20 kg under the limit.

The final answer is: $boxed{-20}$"
"To find the total number of cookies, we need to determine the number of cookies each person has. 

We know Katarina has 68 cookies. 

Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, we can find the total number of cookies by adding the number of cookies each person has: 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298.

The final answer is: 298"
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to consider the two changes made to the dress. 

First, the dress is extended by 50% of its original length. If we let the original length be 'x', then the extended length would be x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

Then, 20cm is added to the bottom of the dress. So, the final length is 1.5x + 20.

We are given that the final length is 140cm. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. Subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

1.5x = 120

Now, divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 120 / 1.5
x = 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode and then add them together.

First, let's find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in turtle mode. Since it takes 1 hour to mow the entire lawn in turtle mode, it will take 0.5 hours to mow half the lawn. We need to convert 0.5 hours to minutes, so we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

0.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 30 minutes

Now, let's find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode. It takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn in rabbit mode, so it will take 20 minutes to mow half the lawn.

Now, we add the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode to get the total time.

30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much longer they have to get to school without being late, we need to calculate the total time it takes for them to get to the fire station and then subtract that from the total time they have to get to school.

They have 30 minutes to get to school. 

It takes them 6 minutes to get to the corner where the library is, and another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. So, the total time it takes to get to the fire station is 6 + 13 = 19 minutes.

Since they have already used 19 minutes, we subtract that from the total time they have to get to school: 30 - 19 = 11 minutes.

They have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late."
"To find the total amount Catherine paid, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 1 kilo of apples is $4.
The cost of 2 kilos of bananas is 2 * $2 = $4.

"To find out how many cookies are in the box, we first need to determine the total number of cookies baked by Greta and Celinda. Greta bakes 30 cookies, and Celinda bakes twice as many, which is 2 * 30 = 60 cookies. 

So, the total number of cookies baked is 30 + 60 = 90 cookies. 

After eating 10 cookies, the number of cookies left is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies. 

Therefore, there are 80 cookies in the box. 

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as T+7 - 7 = T. 

Since there are two twins and one triplet, the total age is 2T + (T) = 3T. We are given that their combined ages are 44, so we can set up the equation 3T = 44.

To find T, we divide both sides of the equation by 3: T = 44 / 3. 

T = 14.67. However, since age cannot be a fraction, we will round down to the nearest whole number. 

One of the twins is 14 years old."
"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his homework and subtract that from the total time he has before dinner.

Now, let's add up the time John spends on his homework: 
20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes.

Now, let's subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner: 
180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes.

So, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to find the cost of one candy. 

We know that Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for $3.20. The cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2. 

Now, we subtract the cost of 5 lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of 4 candies: $3.20 - $2 = $1.20. 

The cost of one candy is $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, we can find the total cost of 10 lollipops: 10 * $0.40 = $4.

The total cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4 + $3 = $7.

"To find out how many coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year) and 10 (the number of years).

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate their total savings per year:
Rong's savings per year = 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Neil's savings per year = 28 * 12 = 336 coins

Now, let's calculate their total savings after 10 years:
Rong's total savings = 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Neil's total savings = 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

"To find the total bill, we first need to calculate the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. 

The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, but we don't know the total bill yet. Let's call the total bill 'x'. The heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100.

So the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total amount John paid is $100 (vaccines and heartworm check). He brought $125 with him, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

"To find the price of the crate, we first need to determine the cost of each fruit. 

Since one banana costs twice as much as an apple, and one apple costs $0.5, a banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

Oranges cost three times as much as a banana, so the cost of one orange is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each type of fruit in a crate:
- Bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- Apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- Oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is the sum of the costs of all the fruits: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

"To find the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter, we need to find the total number of squares and multiply it by the area of each square, which is 1 square foot.

We know that there are 14 red squares. 
There are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so there are 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.
There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so there are 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.
There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so there are 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, let's add up the total number of squares: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68 squares.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

"To find out how many chairs Mia needs, we first need to determine the total number of chairs she has. Since there are 8 high chairs and the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs by multiplying 8 by 5.

8 high chairs * 5 = 40 regular chairs

Now, we add the number of high chairs and regular chairs to find the total number of chairs.

8 high chairs + 40 regular chairs = 48 chairs

Since there will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending, we need to find the total number of chairs required. Babies will use high chairs, so we add the number of adults and babies.

42 adults + 15 babies = 57 people

Since each person needs a chair, we need 57 chairs in total. To find out how many more chairs Mia needs, we subtract the number of chairs she has from the total number of chairs required.

57 total chairs - 48 available chairs = 9 more chairs

Total points = Adam's points + Betty's points + Tom's points + Marta's points
Total points = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the minimum threshold:

"To find out how much money Greta has left to spend, we need to calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account and her car payment, then subtract those amounts from her total paycheck.

First, let's calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account: 50% of $2400.00 is 0.5 x $2400.00 = $1200.00.

Next, let's calculate the amount she uses for her car payment: 20% of $2400.00 is 0.2 x $2400.00 = $480.00.

Now, let's subtract the amounts from her total paycheck: $2400.00 - $1200.00 - $480.00 = $720.00.

So, Greta has $720.00 left to spend.

The final answer is: $720.00"
"To find the number of pairs of pencils in the box, we first need to determine the total number of pencils in the box. Since there are 4 pencils missing, we subtract 4 from the total capacity of the box, which is 20.

20 (total capacity) - 4 (missing pencils) = 16 pencils

Now, we need to find the number of pairs of pencils. A pair consists of 2 pencils. To find the number of pairs, we divide the total number of pencils by 2.

16 (total pencils) / 2 (pencils per pair) = 8 pairs

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we first need to find the total number of fireworks set off in the city and then calculate 40% of that number. 

The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks set off in the city is 15 * 20 = 300.

40% of 300 is 0.4 * 300 = 120.

Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard, which is 3 * 5 = 15 fireworks.

So, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see is 120 (from the city) + 15 (from her backyard) = 135.

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the total amount spent on snacks and drinks, we first need to determine the total number of people and the total number of items (drinks and snacks) they buy.

Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people. When they meet up with 7 more friends, the total number of people becomes 13 + 7 = 20.

Each person buys enough drinks and snacks to fill the seats, which means each person buys 2 drinks and 3 snacks. So, the total number of drinks and snacks bought is 20 * 2 (drinks) + 20 * 3 (snacks) = 40 drinks + 60 snacks = 100 items.

Since each item costs $2, the total amount spent on snacks and drinks is 100 items * $2 = $200.

The final answer is: $200"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.
2. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.
3. The combined capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds.

To find the capacity of Gary's truck, we need to subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity of all three trucks.

Combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks = 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds
Capacity of Gary's truck = Total capacity - Combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks
= 11,600 - 8,800

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many dumplings each male ate and then add the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry.

First, let's find out how many dumplings each male ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

Since there are 6 females and each female ate 3 dumplings, the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

The total number of dumplings eaten is 32 (by males) + 18 (by females) = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the total number of dumplings eaten, which is 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much money Gerald had initially, we need to determine the total parts in the ratio and Gerald's share. The ratio is 3:2, so the total parts are 3 + 2 = 5.

Gerald's share is 3 out of 5 parts, so we can find his initial amount by multiplying his share by the total amount: (3/5) * 100 = 60.

Now, we know Gerald spent $10 on a book, so we subtract that from his initial amount to find out how much he has left: 60 - 10 = 50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. 

Speed of the cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we can find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

Distance = Speed of the turtle * Time
Distance = 3 * 40
Distance = 120 feet

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how many hours they need to fundraise, we need to first determine how much they need to raise per hour to reach their goal. 

The total amount they need to raise is $6300, and they have already raised $2100 in 3 hours. 

The amount they need to raise in total is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

Since they have already raised $2100 in 3 hours, the amount they need to raise per hour is $2100 / 3 = $700.

Now, to find out how many hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal, we can divide the total amount they need to raise ($4200) by the amount they need to raise per hour ($700).

$4200 / $700 = 6 hours.

They need to fundraise for 6 more hours to reach their goal.

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes, we first need to find the percentage used for industrial purposes and then subtract it from the total percentage used by the city.

The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. 

First, find 80% of 40%: 
80% of 40% = 0.8 * 0.4 = 0.32 or 32%

This means 32% of the river's water is used by the city for industrial purposes.

Now, subtract this from the total percentage used by the city to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes:
40% - 32% = 8%

So, 8% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

"To find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rate of each type of ice cream and then add them together.

The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. To find the production rate, we divide the total quarts by the time:

100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour (chocolate)

The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. To find the production rate, we divide the total quarts by the time:

50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour (vanilla)

Now, we need to find the total production in 48 hours for each type of ice cream:

Chocolate: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Adding the total production of both types of ice cream:

2400 quarts (chocolate) + 600 quarts (vanilla) = 3000 quarts

"To find the total bill, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the discount.

First, let's calculate the cost of each item:

- 5 croissants at $3.00 apiece: 5 x $3.00 = $15.00
- 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each: 4 x $2.50 = $10.00
- 3 mini quiches at $4.00 apiece: 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
- 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 apiece: 13 x $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Since Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off his purchase, we need to calculate the discount amount: 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total bill: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many scoops Erin can buy with her $6.00. Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide the total amount of money Erin has by the cost of each scoop.

$6.00 ÷ $1.50 = 4

This means Erin can buy 4 scoops of ice cream. However, the deal is buy 2 scoops get 1 free, so we need to consider this when calculating the total number of scoops Erin can get.

If Erin buys 2 scoops, she will get 1 free, so she will have 3 scoops. If she buys 4 scoops, she will get 2 free, so she will have 6 scoops. Since Erin has $6.00, she can buy 4 scoops and get 2 free, which is the best option.

"To find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we need to calculate how much candy each of them eats in two weeks and then subtract the difference from Amy's initial amount.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, Ginger will have 100 - 56 = 44 pieces, and Amy will have 100 - 42 = 58 pieces.

The difference in the amount of candy they have after two weeks is 58 - 44 = 14.

"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the cost of buying the blueberries at the store and compare it to the cost of picking them.

First, let's calculate the cost of picking the blueberries. The cost to go picking is $20, and then there's an additional $1.5 per pound. Since James picked 30 pounds, the total cost of picking is:

Cost of picking = $20 + (1.5 * 30)
Cost of picking = $20 + $45
Cost of picking = $65

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the blueberries at the store. The cost is $2.5 per pound, and James picked 30 pounds:

Cost at store = 2.5 * 30
Cost at store = $75

To find out how much James saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost at the store:

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many slices were eaten by Bryce and his friends, and then subtract that from the total number of slices.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 5 people in total, 3 people ate 2/3 of their pizzas. 

First, let's find out how many slices 3 people ate. Since each pizza has 12 slices, and 3 people ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we can calculate the total number of slices eaten by these 3 people as follows:

3 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 3 * 8 = 24 slices

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 people, we can calculate the total number of slices eaten by these 2 people as follows:

2 people * 3/4 * 12 slices/person = 2 * 9 = 18 slices

Now, let's add the total number of slices eaten by all 5 people:

24 slices + 18 slices = 42 slices

Since there are a total of 5 people and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is:

5 people * 12 slices/person = 60 slices

Now, let's subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:

The cat eats the sausages in 30 minutes. 
2/3 of 30 minutes is (2/3) * 30 = 20 minutes.

So, the dog eats the sausages in 20 minutes.

To find the average time, we need to add the time taken by the cat and the dog and divide by 2.

Average time = (30 + 20) / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25 minutes.

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe into inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet into inches by multiplying 8 by 12, which equals 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches to that gives us a total of 100 inches for the length of one of Topher's shoes.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. We can write the equation as:

100 = 9x + 10

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

90 = 9x

Now, we can divide both sides by 9 to find the value of 'x':

x = 90 / 9
x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

"To find the total number of windows smashed by Hannah, we need to calculate the number of windows from students' cars and teachers' cars separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of windows from students' cars. There are 64 students' cars with 4 windows each. So, the total number of windows from students' cars is 64 * 4 = 256.

Next, let's find the number of windows from teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars with 2 windows each. Since Hannah smashed 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, we need to find 3/4ths of 32 * 2. To do this, we first find 32 * 2 = 64, then multiply by 3/4, which is the same as multiplying by 0.75. So, 64 * 0.75 = 48.

Now, we add the number of windows from students' cars and teachers' cars to find the total number of windows smashed by Hannah. 256 + 48 = 304.

The final answer is: 304"
"To find the total number of blue spools, we need to add the number of light blue and dark blue spools. 

Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

Next, we need to find the total number of spools. 

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

Now, we can find the percentage of blue spools by dividing the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00 and subtract that from the total number of people.

First, let's find the number of people who voted by midday (12:00). 2/5 of 5000 people voted by midday, so the number of people who voted by midday is:

(2/5) * 5000 = 2000

Now, let's find the number of people who had not voted by midday. This is the total number of people minus the number of people who voted by midday:

5000 - 2000 = 3000

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. The remaining people are the ones who had not voted by midday, which is 3000. So, 2/3 of 3000 people voted by 16:00:

(2/3) * 3000 = 2000

Now, let's find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00. This is the total number of people minus the number of people who voted by 16:00:

5000 - 2000 (voted by midday) - 2000 (voted by 16:00) = 1000

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000.

"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will chew in 30 days and then divide that by the number of pieces in a pack.

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. To find the total number of pieces he will chew in 30 days, we multiply the number of pieces he chews per day by 30:

4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces

Now, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces in a pack to find out how many packs he will need:

120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the total number of smores needed, we first calculate the number of smores the kids and adults want. 

9 kids want 2 smores each, so 9 * 2 = 18 smores for the kids. 
6 adults want 1 s'more each, so 6 * 1 = 6 smores for the adults. 
Total smores needed = 18 (for kids) + 6 (for adults) = 24 smores.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 smores, we divide the total number of smores needed by 8 to find out how many sleeves are required. 
24 smores / 8 smores per sleeve = 3 sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we divide the total number of sleeves required by 3 to find out how many boxes are needed. 
3 sleeves / 3 sleeves per box = 1 box.

Therefore, they will need 1 box of graham crackers.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we first need to find their individual ages.

Given that Dora is 15 years old, we can find her father's age by using the information that her father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 

Father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8
Father's age = 2 * 15 + 8
Father's age = 30 + 8
Father's age = 38

Now, we know that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. 

Mother's age = Father's age - 4
Mother's age = 38 - 4
Mother's age = 34

Now that we have the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother, we can find the total combined age.

Total combined age = Dora's age + Father's age + Mother's age
Total combined age = 15 + 38 + 34
Total combined age = 87

"To find the number of votes candidate C got, we first need to find the number of votes candidate B got. 

Candidate A got 20% of the votes, which is 20% of 100 voters. 
20% of 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes.

Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes. 
50% of 20 votes = 0.5 * 20 = 10 votes. 
So, candidate B got 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

The total number of votes is 100. 
Candidate A and B got 20 + 30 = 50 votes. 
Candidate C got the rest of the votes, which is 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

- Total students = 50
- Students who like to bake = 10
- Students who like to play basketball = 5
- Students who like to play music = 2 * (students who like to play basketball) = 2 * 5 = 10

We know that the rest of the students like to either play video games or play music. So, the number of students who like to play video games or music = Total students - (students who like to bake + students who like to play basketball) 
= 50 - (10 + 5)
= 50 - 15
= 35

Since the number of students who like to play music is 10, the number of students who like to play video games = Total students who like to play video games or music - students who like to play music

"To find the number of boys in each class, we first need to find the total number of girls in both classes. Since 40% of the students in each class are girls, and there are 80 students in total, we can set up an equation to find the number of students in each class.

Let x be the number of students in each class. Then, 2x = 80 (since there are two classes with the same number of students).

Solving for x, we get x = 80 / 2 = 40.

Now that we know there are 40 students in each class, we can find the number of girls in each class. 40% of 40 is 0.4 * 40 = 16 girls in each class.

Since there are 40 students in each class, and 16 are girls, the number of boys in each class is 40 - 16 = 24.

"To find out how much money the tomato vendor saves a week, we need to first calculate the daily savings and then multiply it by 7.

The vendor used to buy 500 tomatoes a day at $.5 each, so his daily cost was 500 * $.5 = $250.

With the new vendor, he buys the same 500 tomatoes at $.4 each, so his new daily cost is 500 * $.4 = $200.

The daily savings is the difference between the old cost and the new cost, which is $250 - $200 = $50.

To find the weekly savings, we multiply the daily savings by 7: $50 * 7 = $350.

90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. 
Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons.

Now, she has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. 
Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

Now, she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. 
Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

"Let's break down the information given. 

Let's denote the number of cases of shingles the second house needs as 'x'. Since the first house needs 1/2 of the second, the first house needs x/2 cases of shingles. 

The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases of shingles.

We know that the total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. So, we can set up the equation: x + x/2 + x = 250.

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + x + 2x = 500.

Combine like terms: 5x = 500.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 100.

Now that we know the second house needs 100 cases of shingles, we can find the number of cases the third house needs, which is x = 100.

The third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

"To find the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

The company sold 5 vanilla scents and there are 4 vanilla scents available, so the total number of vanilla scents sold is 5 * 4 = 20.

The company sold 2 fruity scents and there are 8 fruity scents available, so the total number of fruity scents sold is 2 * 8 = 16.

Now, we need to find the difference between the total number of vanilla scents sold and the total number of fruity scents sold. 

Difference = Total vanilla scents sold - Total fruity scents sold
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we first need to calculate how much money he makes from selling the eggplants. 

He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount he makes from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, and he already makes $60 from selling the eggplants, he needs to make $135 - $60 = $75 from selling the corn.

He has 25 ears of corn, so to find out how much he should sell each ear for, we divide the total amount he needs to make from corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25). 

$75 / 25 = $3.

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total time Tatiana has available for soccer, video games, and reading, we need to add the hours she has on Saturday and Sunday. 

Total time available = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

She reads for 3 hours, so the remaining time for soccer and video games is:
Remaining time = Total time available - Time spent reading
Remaining time = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time:
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

Now, we can find the time spent playing soccer:
Time spent playing soccer = Remaining time - Time spent playing video games
Time spent playing soccer = 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we need to divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time available and multiply by 100:
Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (Time spent playing soccer / Total time available) * 100
Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps of the problem.

Anthony started with 50 pencils. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon. 

1/2 of 50 is 50 * 1/2 = 25. So, Anthony gave 25 pencils to Brandon. 

Now, Anthony has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.

He then gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. 

3/5 of 25 is 25 * 3/5 = 15. So, Anthony gave 15 pencils to Charlie.

Now, Anthony has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to drive to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Jack to drive to the museum:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time = 2 hours

Since he drives to the museum and back, we need to multiply the time by 2:

Total driving time = 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours

Now, we add the time he spends at the museum to the total driving time:

Total time = Total driving time + Time at the museum
Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time = 10 hours

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many wheels Henry will need in total, we need to calculate the number of wheels required for the cars and the motorcycles separately and then add them together.

For the cars, Henry needs 4 wheels for each car, and he has 57 cars. So, the total number of wheels required for the cars is 57 * 4 = 228.

For the motorcycles, Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle, and he has 73 motorcycles. So, the total number of wheels required for the motorcycles is 73 * 2 = 146.

Now, we add the total number of wheels required for the cars and the motorcycles: 228 + 146 = 374.

Since Henry has a box with 650 wheels in it, we subtract the total number of wheels required from the total number of wheels available: 650 - 374 = 276.

The final answer is: 276"
"To find the discount amount, we need to calculate 20% of the original price of the laptop, which is $1000.

20% of $1000 = 0.20 * $1000 = $200

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the final amount you have to pay:

$1000 - $200 = $800

So, you have to pay $800. 

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we need to calculate the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the remaining movies.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. A third of the movies are in series, so we can calculate this as:

600 / 3 = 200 movies in series

Since Mike can get these movies for only $6 of the cost of a normal movie, we can calculate the cost of the series as:

200 * $6 = $1200

Next, let's find the number of older movies. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we need to find the number of remaining movies first. We subtract the number of movies in series from the total number of movies:

600 - 200 = 400 remaining movies

Then, we can find the number of older movies:

400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies

Since the older movies cost $5 each, we can calculate the cost of the older movies as:

160 * $5 = $800

Now, we need to find the number of remaining movies that are not in series and not older movies. We subtract the number of movies in series and the number of older movies from the total number of movies:

600 - 200 - 160 = 240 remaining movies

Since a normal movie costs $10, we can calculate the cost of the remaining movies as:

240 * $10 = $2400

Finally, we can find the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection by adding the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the remaining movies:

$1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400

The final answer is: $4400"
"To find the total amount Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

The cost of peaches is 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00
The cost of plums is 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00
The cost of apricots is 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, let's add the costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

The final answer is: $38.00"
"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance they traveled by driving and hiking, and then add them together.

First, let's find the speed at which they hiked. They hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Their driving speed was 50 miles per hour. Half of 50 is 25, and 5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the distance they traveled by driving. They drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time, so the distance they traveled by driving is 50 * 6 = 300 miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance they traveled by hiking. They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time, so the distance they traveled by hiking is 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

Now, let's add the distance they traveled by driving and hiking to find the total distance to their vacation spot. Total distance = 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

The final answer is: 330"
"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the points each of them gets from enemies, berries, and the timer.

Let's assume Emma's score from enemies is x. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava's score from enemies will be x + 8.

Emma collects 3 fewer berries than Ava, so let's assume Ava collects y berries. Emma collects y - 3 berries.

The time difference is 4 seconds, and Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower. This means Emma finishes the level 4 seconds earlier. Since Emma gets 30 points for every second left on the timer, Emma gets 30 * 4 = 120 points more from the timer than Ava.

Now, let's calculate their total scores:

Emma's score = (x) + (y - 3) + (30 * 4)
Ava's score = (x + 8) + y + (30 * (-4))

Simplifying the equations:
Emma's score = x + y - 3 + 120
Ava's score = x + 8 + y - 120

Now, let's find the difference between their scores:
Difference = Ava's score - Emma's score
Difference = (x + 8 + y - 120) - (x + y - 3 + 120)
Difference = x + 8 + y - 120 - x - y + 3 - 120
Difference = -208 + 8
Difference = -200

The final answer is: -200"
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to find the total cost of the two pizzas that we already know. 

The two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each will be 2 x 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract the cost of these two pizzas from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the cost of the other two pizzas. 

64 - 60 = 4 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

4 / 2 = 2 dollars.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of times they ride their bikes on usual days and the number of times they ride on the two extra days.

On usual days, they ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days. So, the total number of times they ride on usual days is 3 * 5 = 15.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times a day. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

Now, we add the total number of times they ride on usual days and the extra days to get the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week. 

15 (usual days) + 12 (extra days) = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"Let's break down the information given:

Initially, Bob had 7 fish in his pond, with 3 orange and 4 white.

After buying more fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's denote the number of white fish he bought as 'x'. The number of orange fish he bought would then be 2x (since he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish).

The total number of fish in the pond after buying more fish is 7 (initial fish) + 17 (new fish) = 24.

The total number of white fish in the pond after buying more fish is 4 (initial white fish) + x (new white fish).

The total number of orange fish in the pond after buying more fish is 3 (initial orange fish) + 2x (new orange fish).

Since the total number of fish in the pond is 24, we can set up the equation:

4 + x + 3 + 2x = 24

Combine like terms:

3x + 7 = 24

Subtract 7 from both sides:

3x = 17

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 17/3

x = 5.67

However, since we can't buy a fraction of a fish, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we are looking for the number of white fish he bought, and we can't have a fraction of a fish. However, we can still solve for x and use it to find the number of white fish he bought.

Since we know that the number of white fish he bought is x, and we know that the total number of white fish in the pond after buying more fish is 4 + x, we can set up the equation:

4 + x = 2(3 + 2x)

Simplify the equation:

4 + x = 6 + 4x

Subtract x from both sides:

4 = 6 + 3x

Subtract 6 from both sides:

-2 = 3x

Divide both sides by -3:

x = -2/3

However, this is not possible since we can't have a negative number of fish. This means that the initial assumption that we can round down to the nearest whole number is incorrect. We need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-examine the problem. We know that the total number of fish in the pond after buying more fish is 24, and the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. We can set up the equation:

3 + 2x = 2(4 + x)

Simplify the equation:

"To calculate the weekly fuel consumption, we need to first calculate the daily fuel consumption. 

The one-way distance between home and office is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 5 * 2 = 10 miles. 

Since Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, he drives 10 miles * 5 days = 50 miles per week.

Given that Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, we can calculate the weekly fuel consumption as follows:

Weekly fuel consumption = Total miles driven per week / Fuel efficiency
= 50 miles / 10 MPG
= 5 gallons per week

Now, we can calculate the weekly fuel cost by multiplying the weekly fuel consumption by the price of gas:

Weekly fuel cost = Weekly fuel consumption * Price per gallon
= 5 gallons * $3/gallon
= $15 per week

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie spent, we need to calculate the amount spent from the quarters and the amount spent from the twenties, then add them together.

First, let's find the total amount of money Carrie had from the quarters. Since she had 140 quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25, we can multiply the number of quarters by the value of each quarter:

140 quarters * $0.25 = $35

Next, let's find the amount of money Carrie had from the twenties. She had 10 twenties, and each twenty is worth $20. Since she spent 3/5 of the twenties, we need to find 3/5 of 10 twenties:

3/5 * 10 = 6 twenties

Now, we multiply the number of twenties she spent by the value of each twenty:

6 twenties * $20 = $120

Now, we add the amount spent from the quarters and the amount spent from the twenties to find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch:

$35 + $120 = $155

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to find the total percentage of smart TVs and analog TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 TVs. 
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 * 40 = 5 TVs.

The total number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold is 10 + 5 = 15 TVs.

Since the rest of the TVs are OLED TVs, we subtract the total number of smart and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold: 40 - 15 = 25.

So, Samwell sold 25 OLED TVs.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much money John is missing, we first need to determine how much the school will cover. Since the school is covering half the cost of the trip, we can calculate this as:

Total cost of the trip = $300
School's contribution = Total cost / 2
School's contribution = $300 / 2
School's contribution = $150

Now, we know that John has $50 and the school is covering $150, so the total amount covered is $150 + $50 = $200.

To find out how much John is missing, we subtract the total amount covered from the total cost of the trip:

Amount John is missing = Total cost of the trip - Total amount covered
Amount John is missing = $300 - $200
Amount John is missing = $100

The final answer is: $100"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out the temperature at night and then determine how many logs Carson needs to burn to reach the safe temperature of 32 degrees.

First, let's find the temperature at night. It's 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the day, and the day temperature is 45 degrees. 

Night temperature = Day temperature - 33
Night temperature = 45 - 33
Night temperature = 12 degrees

Since the temperature at night is 12 degrees, Carson needs to heat the house up to 32 degrees to prevent the pipes from freezing. 

Temperature to be heated = 32 - 12
Temperature to be heated = 20 degrees

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we divide the temperature to be heated by the temperature each log heats up.

Number of logs = Temperature to be heated / Temperature per log
Number of logs = 20 / 5
Number of logs = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total number of seashells, we first need to find the number of groups and then the number of groups that brought seashells. 

First, let's find the number of groups: 
Number of people = 90
Number of people per group = 9
Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
Number of groups = 90 / 9
Number of groups = 10

Now, let's find the number of groups that brought seashells: 
Fraction of groups that brought seashells = 3/5
Number of groups that brought seashells = Number of groups * Fraction of groups that brought seashells
Number of groups that brought seashells = 10 * (3/5)
Number of groups that brought seashells = 6

Now, let's find the total number of seashells: 
Number of seashells per group = 2
Total number of seashells = Number of groups that brought seashells * Number of seashells per group
Total number of seashells = 6 * 2
Total number of seashells = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the number of people on the train after the two stops, we need to subtract the number of people who got off and add the number of people who got on.

Initially, there were 172 people on the train.

At the first stop, 47 people got off, so we subtract 47 from 172:
172 - 47 = 125

Then, 13 people got on, so we add 13 to 125:
125 + 13 = 138

At the next stop, 38 people got off, so we subtract 38 from 138:
138 - 38 = 100

Therefore, there are 100 people on the train.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to calculate the total number of bottle caps he finds in 30 days and then multiply it by the value of each bottle cap.

Damien finds 10 bottle caps a day. 
In 30 days, he will find 10 * 30 = 300 bottle caps.

Each bottle cap is worth $0.25.

"To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs.

First, we know there are 12 female lions. 

Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, we can find the number of male lions by dividing the number of female lions by 2. 
12 / 2 = 6 male lions

Now, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions in the enclosure.
12 (female lions) + 6 (male lions) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32

The final answer is: 32"
"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans first. 

The original price of the jeans is $40. 
The discount is 25% off, which means Mike will pay 75% of the original price. 
To find 75% of $40, we multiply $40 by 0.75 (since 100% - 25% = 75%). 
$40 * 0.75 = $30. 

Now, we know Mike will pay $30 for the jeans. 
Mike pays with a $50 bill, so to find out how much money he will have left over, we subtract the price of the jeans from the $50 bill. 
$50 - $30 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first find the total number of employees after three months. 

The company initially has 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. So, after one month, the total number of employees will be 200 + 20 = 220. 
After two months, the total number of employees will be 220 + 20 = 240. 
After three months, the total number of employees will be 240 + 20 = 260.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months. Each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month. So, the total amount of money paid to 260 employees for one month is 260 * 4000 = $1040000.

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is 3 * 1040000 = $3120000.

"To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours.

Billy's initial hourly wage was $10. After 2 months, he got a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new hourly wage $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. After another year, he got a raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final hourly wage $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, so her hourly wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50.

Now, let's calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours:

Billy's total earnings = 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230
Sally's total earnings = 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210

The difference in their earnings is $230 - $210 = $20.

"To find Nikita's score, we need to calculate half of Pierson's score and then add 11. 

Pierson's score is 278. Half of 278 is 278 / 2 = 139. 

Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score, so Nikita's score is 139 + 11 = 150.

To find the total score, we need to add Pierson's score and Nikita's score. 

Pierson's score is 278 and Nikita's score is 150. 

278 + 150 = 428.

The final answer is: 428"
"To find the total number of trees planted by the students, we need to multiply the number of classes by the average number of students per class and then multiply the result by 1 (since each student plants 1 tree).

Total students = 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students
Total trees planted by students = 1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees

To find the total number of trees planted by the teachers, we need to multiply the number of classes by the average number of teachers per class and then multiply the result by 2 (since each teacher plants 2 trees).

Total teachers = 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers
Total trees planted by teachers = 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees

Now, we add the total number of trees planted by students and teachers to find the overall number of trees planted.

Total trees = 1000 trees (by students) + 240 trees (by teachers) = 1240 trees

"To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. 

30% of 14 = 0.3 * 14 = 4.2

Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we'll consider the context of the problem. If Bubbles buys 5 stuffed goats, the percentage of stuffed goats will be 5/19, which is approximately 26.32%. Since 5 stuffed goats is less than 30%, we'll need to buy more. 

Let's try buying 6 stuffed goats. The total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + 6 = 20. 

Now, we'll find 30% of 20. 

30% of 20 = 0.3 * 20 = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To find out how many hours Kris has played, we need to calculate the total hours she played in 2 weeks and 1 week.

In 2 weeks, there are 14 days. If Kris plays for half an hour every day, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in 2 weeks.

In 1 week, there are 7 days. If Kris plays for 2 hours every day, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in 1 week.

Total hours Kris has played is 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours. So, the hours she still needs to play is 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time.

The first car travels at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 miles/hour x 2 hours = 120 miles

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 70 miles/hour x 2 hours = 140 miles

Since the second car was initially passing the first car, we need to find the distance between them after 2 hours. The second car has traveled 140 miles, and the first car has traveled 120 miles. The distance between them is the difference between the two distances:
Distance = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade:

- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice the fourth-graders', so it's 2 * 40 = 80 out of 100 passed

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed:
340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 80 (fifth-graders) = 460 students passed

Next, let's calculate the total number of students in the school:
500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000 students

Now, we can find the overall pass rate:
(460 students passed / 1000 total students) * 100 = 46%

"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we first need to determine how many square inches of mosaic he can make with the glass chips he has. 

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, and each bag holds 72 chips, we can calculate the total number of chips Milo has: 2 bags * 72 chips per bag = 144 chips.

Now, we need to find out how many square inches of mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch, we divide the total number of chips by 12: 144 chips / 12 chips per square inch = 12 square inches.

Since the mosaic is three inches tall, and we know the area of the mosaic (12 square inches), we can find the length by dividing the area by the height: 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches.

So, Milo can make a mosaic that is 4 inches long.

"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount of tea each group of students drank and add them together.

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so the total amount of tea they drank is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.

16 students drank 2 quarts each, so the total amount of tea they drank is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we know that 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts. 

So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party in gallons is 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we first need to determine how many candies he has in total. 

Initially, Dale had 100 candies. He sold 150, so he was left with 100 - 150 = -50 candies. However, this is not possible since you can't have a negative number of candies. This means he must have sold more than he had initially. 

Let's recalculate: Dale initially had 100 candies, but he sold 150, which is more than he had. This means he must have had some candies left from the initial order and then ordered more. 

Let's assume he had x candies left from the initial order. Then, he sold 150 candies and had x candies left. After that, he ordered 100 more candies. So, the total number of candies he has now is x + 100.

We know that he initially had 100 candies, and he sold 150. This means that the number of candies he had left after selling 150 is 100 - 150 = -50. However, we know that he must have had some candies left, so let's assume he had y candies left from the initial order. Then, he sold 150 - y candies. 

Since he had y candies left after selling 150 - y candies, we can set up the equation: y = 100 - (150 - y). 

Simplifying the equation, we get: y = 100 - 150 + y. 
Combine like terms: y = -50 + y. 
Subtract y from both sides: 0 = -50. This is not possible, so our initial assumption is incorrect.

Let's try again. We know that Dale initially had 100 candies and sold 150. This means he must have had some candies left from the initial order and then ordered more. 

Let's assume he had x candies left from the initial order. Then, he sold 150 - x candies. After that, he ordered 100 more candies. So, the total number of candies he has now is x + 100.

We know that he initially had 100 candies, and he sold 150. This means that the number of candies he had left after selling 150 is 100 - 150 = -50. However, we know that he must have had some candies left, so let's assume he had y candies left from the initial order. Then, he sold 150 - y candies. 

Since he had y candies left after selling 150 - y candies, we can set up the equation: y = 100 - (150 - y). 

Simplifying the equation, we get: y = 100 - 150 + y. 
Combine like terms: y = -50 + y. 
Subtract y from both sides: 0 = -50. This is not possible, so our initial assumption is incorrect.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of each month and then subtract the initial number of students from it.

At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students.

- At the end of January, the number of students doubles, so there are 10 * 2 = 20 students.
- At the end of February, the number of students doubles again, so there are 20 * 2 = 40 students.
- At the end of March, the number of students doubles again, so there are 40 * 2 = 80 students.
- At the end of April, the number of students doubles again, so there are 80 * 2 = 160 students.
- At the end of May, the number of students doubles again, so there are 160 * 2 = 320 students.

Now, let's subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May to find the additional students: 320 - 10 = 310.

The final answer is: 310"
"To find the total number of branches Felix climbed, we need to divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch. 

Total money made = $105
Cost per branch = $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week, which has 5 days, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 5
Average branches per day = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers and then subtract the petals that were dropped.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 x 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 x 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 x 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 x 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, we need to subtract 4 petals (1 from each set) from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

The final answer is: 97"
"To find out how many marshmallows are left in the bag, we need to subtract the total number of marshmallows used and the ones dropped from the initial number of marshmallows.

Initially, there were 35 marshmallows. John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores, so together they made 18 S'mores. They also dropped 3 marshmallows. 

Total marshmallows used = 18 (from S'mores) + 3 (dropped) = 21 marshmallows

Marshmallows left = 35 (initial) - 21 (used) = 14 marshmallows

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the number of S'mores they can make with the remaining marshmallows is equal to the number of marshmallows left.

Each kid can have 7 S'mores (14 marshmallows / 2 kids).

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person plays and then determine how many quarters they use.

Jack can play for 20 minutes. His two friends who are worse can play for half as long, which is 20 / 2 = 10 minutes. The friend who is better can play for 1.5 times as long, which is 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes.

Since they play for 4 hours, we need to convert this to minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Now, let's calculate how many times each person can play in 240 minutes:

- Jack: 240 minutes / 20 minutes/game = 12 games
- The two worse friends: 240 minutes / 10 minutes/game = 24 games each
- The better friend: 240 minutes / 30 minutes/game = 8 games

The cost of a game is 1 quarter. So, the total number of quarters used is:
12 (Jack's games) + 24 (worse friend 1's games) + 24 (worse friend 2's games) + 8 (better friend's games) = 68 quarters

Since each quarter costs $0.25, the total amount of money used is:
68 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $17

The final answer is: $17"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as Z, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of salt as S, the amount of sugar as S, and the amount of oil as O.

We know that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so F = Z.

We also know that she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so S = S.

We know that she uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.

We also know that she uses twice as much salt as zest, so S = 2Z.

Since F = Z, we can substitute F with Z in the equation S = 2Z, so S = 2Z.

Now we have O = 2S and S = 2Z. We can substitute S with 2Z in the equation O = 2S, so O = 2(2Z) = 4Z.

Since the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, the sum of all the ingredients is 10. So, Z + F + S + S + O = 10.

We can substitute F with Z and S with 2Z in the equation, so Z + Z + 2Z + 2Z + 4Z = 10.

Combine like terms, 10Z = 10.

Divide both sides by 10, Z = 1.

Now that we know Z = 1, we can find O. Since O = 4Z, O = 4(1) = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of the goats is 3 * $500 = $1500.
The cost of the cows is 2 * $1500 = $3000.

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

So, John spent $4500 in total. 

$4500"
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Paul needs 63 cupcakes in total. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, so the total number of cupcakes he has is 8 + 40 = 48.

Now, let's subtract the number of cupcakes he has from the total number of cupcakes he needs: 63 - 48 = 15.

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Robert has 20 cars.
2. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, so Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.
3. Joe sells 20% of his cars, which is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.
4. He gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold, which is 2 * 8 = 16 cars.
5. So, Joe gives away a total of 8 (sold) + 16 (given away) = 24 cars.
6. Joe initially had 40 cars, and after selling and giving away 24 cars, he is left with 40 - 24 = 16 cars.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to first determine the total amount raised by the students. Since the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, the amount raised by the students is $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Now, we know that there are 20 students and they all raised the same amount. To find out how much each student raised, we can divide the total amount raised by the students ($125,000) by the number of students (20).

$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250

Each student raised $6,250."
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day, then add them together.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

Now, let's convert the hours into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes
4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes

Now, let's add the time from both days:
480 minutes + 240 minutes = 720 minutes

The final answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to first find the total number of cars in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break.

Initially, there were 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.

When Hunter got out of class for the lunch break, 1/2 of the cars had left. This means that 1/2 of 70 cars had left, which is 70 / 2 = 35 cars.

So, the number of cars that remained in the parking lot when Hunter got out of class for the lunch break is 70 - 35 = 35 cars.

Now, we need to find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break. Since 1/2 of the cars had left, the other half must have been there. Therefore, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is also 35.

The final answer is: 35"
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 different tasks. So, the total number of tasks he completes in a day is:
30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day

Since each task pays $1.20, the total amount John makes in a day is:
150 tasks/day * $1.20/task = $180/day

John works a full 7-day week, so the total amount he makes in a week is:
$180/day * 7 days/week = $1260/week

The final answer is: $1260"
"To find out how many points Sasha scored in the first game, we already know that she scored 14 points. 

In the first game, Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so we subtract 4 from Sasha's score: 14 - 4 = 10 points.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, we subtract 6 from Julie's score to find out how many points Sasha scored in the second game: 10 - 6 = 4 points.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add the points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18 points.

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as 'x'. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. We can write the equation as:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Since PJ has x cards, Smendrick has 3x cards, and Becca has 3x + 12 cards, we can find Becca's number of cards:
Becca's cards = 3(47) + 12
Becca's cards = 141 + 12
Becca's cards = 153

The final answer is: 153"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs and then add them together.

Cindy had 5 green eggs. 
She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.
She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and subtract the refund amount from the purchase price.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The book weighs 4 pounds and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound, so the weight-based shipping cost is 4 * $0.35 = $1.40. The book needs to be returned 20 miles away, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile, so the distance-based shipping cost is 20 * $0.08 = $1.60. The total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $2.99.

Now, let's calculate the refund amount. Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price, which is 0.75 * $32 = $24.

The total cost of shipping is $2.99, and the refund amount is $24. To find out how much Milly will lose, we subtract the refund amount from the shipping cost: $2.99 - $24 = -$21.91. However, since we can't lose a negative amount of money, we need to recalculate the refund amount as the difference between the shipping cost and the refund amount. 

The correct calculation is: $2.99 - $24 = -$21.01. However, since we can't lose a negative amount of money, we need to recalculate the refund amount as the difference between the shipping cost and the refund amount.

"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to first calculate the total amount of money she has after her father gave her $100. 

Mulan initially had $40. Her father gave her $100, so she now has $40 + $100 = $140.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought. She bought two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so the total cost of the jeans is 2 x $30 = $60. She also bought a bag for $20, so the total cost of the items is $60 + $20 = $80.

Now, we subtract the total cost of the items from the total amount of money she has: $140 - $80 = $60.

So, Mulan has $60 left.

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for the first three weeks and then determine the pattern.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.
In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, we can find out how much he produces in the fourth week by subtracting the production of the first three weeks from the total production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

The final answer is: 14,000"
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on TikTok in a week and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the time she spends on TikTok in a week:

- Time spent recording videos: 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes
- Time spent writing songs: 2 hours = 120 minutes
- Time spent doing makeup: 15 minutes * 6 days = 90 minutes

Total time spent on TikTok in a week = 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly time by 4:
282 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1128 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
1128 minutes / 60 = 18.8 hours

The final answer is: 18.8"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. However, Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. We need to find the difference between what's included in the initial installation and what Angela needs.

Angela needs 6 - 4 = 2 more mirrors, 
2 - 1 = 1 more chandelier, 
and 20 - 10 = 10 more pictures.

The cost of the initial installation is $129.00. The cost of the additional items is $15.00 per item. So, the total cost of the additional items is (2 + 1 + 10) * $15.00 = 13 * $15.00 = $195.00.

The total cost is the cost of the initial installation plus the cost of the additional items: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

The final answer is: $324.00"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Eva has saved $20.00.
2. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.
3. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply $30.00 by 0.40, which is $12.00.
4. To find Roy's total savings, we add the 40% more to Anthony's savings: $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

The final answer is: $42.00"
"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to determine the lifting capacity of each person relative to Pompei. 

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. 
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 * 1 = 12 inches. 
Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches. 
Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we need to convert 480 inches to feet. 
480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total distance traveled by Mason, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours, and then add them together.

Distance = Speed x Time

For the first 4 hours:
Distance = 8 miles/hour x 4 hours = 32 miles

For the next 6 hours:
Distance = 8 miles/hour x 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the time it takes for one kangaroo to travel across the highway. Since three kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, one kangaroo would take three times as long, which is 18 * 3 = 54 hours.

Now, we know that the turtles travel at half the speed of a kangaroo. So, if one kangaroo takes 54 hours to travel across the highway, four turtles traveling at half the speed would take twice as long, which is 54 * 2 = 108 hours.

The final answer is: 108"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Kora made 20 dishes. Since Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora, Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes. 

Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

To find the total number of clay dishes they all make together, we add the number of dishes each person made: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140.

The final answer is: 140"
"Let's break down the information given. Erika's total savings after trading in her old laptop is the price of the new laptop minus the discount, which is $600 - $200 = $400. 

She has been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom gave her $80, so she has $150 + $80 = $230 from these two sources.

Since she now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, she must have $400 (total savings) - $50 (remaining amount needed) = $350 in her purse initially.

However, we know she has $230 from her job and her mom, so the amount in her purse initially must be $350 (total savings) - $230 (amount from job and mom) = $120.

"To find out how many slices Adam has left, we first need to calculate the total number of slices he has. 

3 large apples can be sliced into 3 * 5 = 15 slices. 
5 small apples can be sliced into 5 * 3 = 15 slices. 

In total, Adam has 15 + 15 = 30 slices. 

Since Adam eats 15 slices, we subtract the number of slices he ate from the total number of slices: 
30 - 15 = 15

"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to find out how many cows he currently has. 

The farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each cow, and he has 3 cows. So, the total milk he currently produces is 5 * 3 = 15 liters.

To find out how many more cows he needs, we need to find out how many cows are needed to produce 25 liters of milk a day. We can do this by dividing 25 by 5, which is the amount of milk each cow produces. 

25 / 5 = 5 cows. 

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, he needs 5 - 3 = 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the used length of each stick and subtract it from the original length.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so the used length is 1 - 1/6 = 5/6 of the original length. 
The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so the used length is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3 of the original length.
The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so the used length is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2 of the original length.

Now, let's calculate the used length of each stick in millimeters:
- First glue stick: 5/6 * 12 = 10 mm
- Second glue stick: 1/3 * 12 = 4 mm
- Third glue stick: 1/2 * 12 = 6 mm

Now, let's calculate the total used length: 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 mm

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is the original length minus the total used length: 12 - 20 = -8 mm

However, since we cannot have a negative length, this means that the total used length is more than the original length, which is not possible. This indicates that the problem has an error or inconsistency.

However, if we assume that the problem is asking for the total length of the glue sticks that are used, we can proceed with the calculation.

The total length of the glue sticks that are used is 20 mm."
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy and subtract the amount of money he already has.

The total cost of the items is $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10080.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200, so he has a total of $5000 + $200 = $5200.

Now, let's subtract the amount of money Gabriel has from the total cost of the items: $10080 - $5200 = $3580.

So, Gabriel still needs $3580."

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so the number of socks Jack has is 60 / 2 = 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 2 * 30 = 60 socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90 socks
Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90 dishes

Total number of socks and dishes together = 90 + 90 = 180

"To find the number of students good at math, we need to consider the total number of students and the number of students good at both subjects. 

Let's denote the number of students good at both math and English as x. We know that the total number of students is 20, and the number of students good at math only is 5, and the number of students good at English only is 8.

We can set up the equation: 5 (math only) + 8 (English only) + x (both) = 20 (total)

Simplifying the equation, we get: 13 + x = 20

Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get: x = 7

This means that 7 students are good at both math and English. To find the total number of students good at math, we need to add the number of students good at math only (5) and the number of students good at both subjects (7).

Total number of students good at math = 5 (math only) + 7 (both) = 12

There's a 10-minute intermission, so we subtract that from the total time: 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Each group takes 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage. So, the total time for each group is 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes.

Now, we divide the available time for performances (110 minutes) by the time each group takes (10 minutes): 110 / 10 = 11.

"Let's denote my age as 'M', my brother's age as 'B', and my sister's age as 'S'. 

Since I am three years younger than my brother, we can write the equation: M = B - 3.

I am 2 years older than my sister, so we can write: M = S + 2.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so we can write: M's mom's age = 3B - 1.

The sum of all our ages is 87, so we can write: M + B + S + M's mom's age = 87.

Substituting the expressions for M and M's mom's age, we get: (B - 3) + B + S + (3B - 1) = 87.

Combine like terms: 5B + S - 4 = 87.

Now, we can substitute the expression for M in terms of S: B - 3 = S + 2, so B = S + 5.

Substituting this into the previous equation, we get: 5(S + 5) + S - 4 = 87.

Expanding the equation, we get: 5S + 25 + S - 4 = 87.

Combine like terms: 6S + 21 = 87.

Subtract 21 from both sides: 6S = 66.

Divide by 6: S = 11.

Now that we know S, we can find B: B = S + 5 = 11 + 5 = 16.

And finally, we can find M: M = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13.

So, I am 13 years old.

"To find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs, we first need to determine the total number of glue sticks required for the students. Since each student needs 2 glue sticks and there are 27 students, the total number of glue sticks needed is 27 * 2 = 54.

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by the number of glue sticks per pack to find out how many packs are needed. However, since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and expects to have some extra glue sticks left over, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

To do this, we can divide 54 by 8, which gives us 6.75. Since we can't buy a fraction of a pack, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 7.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at the given point over the three days.

On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point over the three days, we need to add the amounts of water passing through the river each day.

Total amount of water = 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. Since each infected person infects six others, we can model the growth of the plague as a geometric progression.

Let's denote the initial number of infected people as P0 = 10. The number of new infections each day can be calculated as 6 times the number of infected people from the previous day.

Day 1: P1 = P0 + 6P0 = 10 + 6(10) = 10 + 60 = 70
Day 2: P2 = P1 + 6P1 = 70 + 6(70) = 70 + 420 = 490
Day 3: P3 = P2 + 6P2 = 490 + 6(490) = 490 + 2940 = 3430

"To find out how much money Julieta received, we need to calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips and subtract it from Rafaela's total tips. 

Rafaela received 40 * $20 = $800 in tips. 

10% of $800 is 0.1 * $800 = $80. 

So, Julieta received $800 - $80 = $720 in tips.

Now, to find the total amount of money they received altogether, we add Rafaela's and Julieta's tips: $800 + $720 = $1520.

The final answer is: $1520"
"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we first need to calculate the total number of oranges given to her children. 

She gave her 3 daughters 2 oranges each, so the total number of oranges given to her daughters is 3 * 2 = 6 oranges. 

Her son received 3 oranges. 

So, the total number of oranges given to her children is 6 (to daughters) + 3 (to son) = 9 oranges.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges initially. To find out how many oranges she remained with, we subtract the total number of oranges given to her children from the initial number of oranges. 

12 (initial oranges) - 9 (oranges given to children) = 3 oranges.

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Claire earns 1 badge per month.
- Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.
- Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), the number of badges earned by each girl would be:
- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 0.5 badges/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:
36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices she baked and sold. 

First, let's find out how many hours she baked. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours.

Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, and each hour she baked for 5 hours, she baked a total of 2 * 5 = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, and she sold all 80 slices. To find the total amount raised, we need to convert the total number of slices to dollars. 

Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, we can convert 50 cents to dollars by dividing by 100. So, 50 cents is equal to 0.5 dollars.

Now, we multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 * 0.5 = 40 dollars.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we first need to determine the number of silver coins she has. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, and she has 70 gold coins, we can set up an equation to find the number of silver coins.

Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'. We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 70

To solve for 'x', we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

x = 70 - 30
x = 40

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. To find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and silver coins:

Total coins = 70 (gold coins) + 40 (silver coins)
Total coins = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we first need to determine the total number of burritos consumed. 

There were 50 students at the picnic, and each student was given 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Mr. George also ate 20 burritos. 

The total number of burritos consumed is 500 (given to students) + 20 (eaten by Mr. George) = 520.

Since there were 600 burritos ordered initially, the total number of leftover burritos is 600 - 520 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the number of yellow cars, we first need to determine the number of green and blue cars. 

We know there are 12 red cars. The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we know the total number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52.

Since the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S.

We are given that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so we can write this as:
A = F - 12

We are also given that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so we can write this as:
S = A + 25

We are also given that together, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books, so we can write this as:
S + A + F = 85

Now, we can substitute the expressions for S and A in terms of F into the third equation:
(F - 12) + (F - 12 + 25) + F = 85

Combine like terms:
3F + 3 = 85

Subtract 3 from both sides:

"To find the weight of the carrots, we first need to find the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the weight of the carrots is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The weight of the carrots is 7 pounds."
"To find out how much Greg will spend on Jello, we first need to determine how many Jello cups he needs to buy. Since there will be 30 kids and each kid will have 4 Jello cups, we multiply the number of kids by the number of cups per kid.

30 kids * 4 cups/kid = 120 cups

Since one 3-ounce box of Jello makes 10 small Jello cups, we need to find out how many boxes Greg needs to buy. 

120 cups / 10 cups/box = 12 boxes

Now, we need to find out how much Greg will spend on Jello. Each box costs $1.25, so we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box.

12 boxes * $1.25/box = $15

"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he ate on each day and add them together.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and divide by 5:
60 * 2 = 120
120 / 5 = 24

So, on the first day, he ate 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. To find the remaining pieces after the first two days, we subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26

Now, we find 7/13 of 26:
26 * 7 = 182
182 / 13 = 14

So, on the third day, he ate 14 pieces.

Now, we add the pieces eaten on each day to find the total:
24 + 10 + 14 = 48

Therefore, Tobias has eaten 48 pieces so far.

"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we first need to find the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water.

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so the cost of one bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

The cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the cost of one bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, we can find the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water by multiplying the cost of one bottle of soda by 3 and the cost of one bottle of water by 2, then adding the results together.

The cost of 3 bottles of soda is 3 x $3.00 = $9.00.
The cost of 2 bottles of water is 2 x $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost is $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

Now, we subtract the total cost of the bolts from the initial amount of money David has:

Initial amount of money = $12.48
Total cost of bolts = $0.48
Money left = Initial amount of money - Total cost of bolts
Money left = $12.48 - $0.48
Money left = $12.00

Initially, Paul has 52 marbles. His friend gave him 28 marbles, so now he has 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.

Then, he lost 1/4 of his marbles. To find out how many marbles he lost, we need to calculate 1/4 of 80, which is 80 * (1/4) = 20 marbles.

Now, we subtract the marbles he lost from the total marbles he had after receiving the gift: 80 - 20 = 60 marbles.

So, Paul has 60 marbles left.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points she gets from each type of question and add them together.

First, let's calculate the points from the multiple-choice questions. Amy correctly answers 80% of the 10 multiple-choice questions, so she gets 0.8 * 10 = 8 points from the multiple-choice questions.

Next, let's calculate the points from the true/false questions. Amy correctly answers 90% of the 20 true/false questions, so she gets 0.9 * 20 = 18 points from the true/false questions.

Now, let's calculate the points from the long-answer questions. Amy correctly answers 60% of the 5 long-answer questions, so she gets 0.6 * 5 = 3 points from the long-answer questions.

Finally, we multiply the points from each type of question by their respective point values and add them together. The multiple-choice questions are worth 1 point each, the true/false questions are worth 1 point each, and the long-answer questions are worth 5 points each. So, we get:

(8 * 1) + (18 * 1) + (3 * 5) = 8 + 18 + 15 = 41

The final answer is: 41"
"To find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we first need to determine how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them, we can calculate the number of chickens he plans to sell as follows:

Number of chickens to sell = 300 * (3/5)
= 300 * 0.6
= 180 chickens

Now, we know that Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 per chicken. To find the total revenue, we multiply the number of chickens by the price per chicken:

Total revenue = 180 * $50
= $9000

Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, we can set up an equation to find the total cost of the chickens:

Total revenue - Total cost = Profit
$9000 - Total cost = $2000
Total cost = $9000 - $2000
Total cost = $7000

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens for $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"
"To find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 2, since they sold an equal number of glasses. 

Total glasses sold by boys = 32 - 14 (glasses sold by Julie) = 18 glasses
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = 18 / 2 = 9 glasses each

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses sold by Micah from the number of glasses sold by Julie.

Difference = 14 (glasses sold by Julie) - 9 (glasses sold by Micah) = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how much Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the manicure. Since Iris spent 1/4 as much on the manicure as she did on her hair, and she spent $400 on her hair, the cost of the manicure is:

$400 * 1/4 = $100

Next, let's find the cost of the pedicure. Since Iris spent 3/4 as much on the pedicure as she did on her manicure, and she spent $100 on her manicure, the cost of the pedicure is:

$100 * 3/4 = $75

Now, let's add up the costs of all three services:

$400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575

The final answer is: $575"
"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope, we need to first calculate how much money she will get from selling the old rope and then subtract the cost of the new rope from that amount.

The length of the rope is 20 meters, and Sarah can sell it for $2 per meter. So, the total amount she will get from selling the old rope is:

20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and Sarah wants to buy a rope of the same length (20 meters). So, the total cost of the new rope is:

20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30

Now, let's subtract the cost of the new rope from the amount Sarah will get from selling the old rope:

$40 - $30 = $10

So, Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope.

The final answer is: $10"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Melanie's current age. Since in 10 years, she will be 18 years old, we can subtract 10 from 18 to find her current age.

Current age = 18 - 10 = 8 years

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let's assume the number of years is 'x'. 

In 'x' years, her age will be 8 + x. This age should be thrice her current age, which is 3 * 8 = 24.

So, we can write the equation: 8 + x = 24

Now, we can solve for 'x' by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation.

x = 24 - 8
x = 16

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's find the cost of the chicken. Since each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and the 5 packs of bacon cost $10, the cost of one pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2. Therefore, the cost of one pack of chicken is $2 * 2 = $4. Since Kelly has 6 packs of chicken, the total cost of the chicken is 6 * $4 = $24.

Next, let's find the cost of the strawberries. Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of the strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

Now, let's find the cost of the apples. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. Since Kelly has 7 packs of apples, the total cost of the apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Finally, let's subtract the total cost of the items from Kelly's budget: $65 (budget) - $60 (total cost) = $5.

The final answer is: $5"
"Let's break down the information given. The final concert is twice as long as Elaina's usual concerts, and the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. 

Let's denote the runtime of her usual concert as 'x'. Since the final concert is twice as long, its runtime is 2x. 

The final concert also includes a 15-minute encore, so the total runtime of the final concert is 2x + 15 = 65 minutes.

To find the runtime of her usual concert, we need to solve for 'x'. 

2x + 15 = 65

Subtract 15 from both sides:
2x = 50

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 25

So, her usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he had initially.

Argo initially had 200 toys. He gave away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. 

First, let's add up the number of toys he gave away: 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys.

Now, let's subtract the number of toys he gave away from the initial number of toys: 200 - 150 = 50.

So, Argo has 50 toys now.

"To find the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged, we first need to find the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs. 

Let's assume the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is x. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is 2x.

However, we know that the singer has 50 microphones in total. Since 20% of the microphones won't find any space to fit in, the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is 80% of 50, which is 0.8 * 50 = 40.

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged is 40 / 2 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate the number of birds in each group and add them together.

First, let's find the number of birds nesting in the bushes: 6 birds.

Next, we need to find 2/3 of the number of birds nesting in the bushes. To do this, we multiply 6 by 2/3: 
6 * (2/3) = 4

So, 2/3 of the birds are flying overhead, which is 4 birds.

Now, let's find the number of birds feeding. There are 3 groups of 8 birds each, so we multiply 3 by 8:
3 * 8 = 24

Now, we add the number of birds in each group together: 
6 (nesting) + 4 (flying) + 24 (feeding) = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to subtract the cookies Lani ate from the total number of cookies and then divide the remaining cookies by the number of jars.

First, let's subtract the cookies Lani ate: 55 - 5 = 50 cookies.

Next, we divide the remaining cookies by the number of jars: 50 / 5 = 10 cookies per jar.

So, there were 10 cookies in each jar.

"To find the number of flowering plants, we first need to find the number of indoor and outdoor plants.

One-fourth of the plants are indoor plants. 
Number of indoor plants = 100 * (1/4) = 25

Remaining plants = 100 - 25 = 75

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. 
Number of outdoor plants = 75 * (2/3) = 50

Number of flowering plants = 75 - 50 = 25

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100.
Percentage of flowering plants = (25/100) * 100 = 25%

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can find the speed of the thingamabob by dividing the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11.

Speed of thingamabob = Speed of whatchamacallit / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig by multiplying the speed of the thingamabob by 5.

Speed of whirligig = Speed of thingamabob * 5
Speed of whirligig = 11 * 5
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

"Let's break down the information given. Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price of the salad. 

Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the price of the yogurt is $6 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of the salad and the yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9. 

Since Ellen pays a total of $11 for her daily goods, and the salad and yogurt cost $9, the cost of two carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.

To find the cost of one carrot, we divide the cost of two carrots by 2. So, the cost of one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark used to make $10 an hour, but his pay was raised by $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we can multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week to find his weekly earnings: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, the number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn is 3x. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's, so the number of times she mowed Alba's lawn is 5x.

The total number of lawns she mowed is x (Joe's) + 3x (Kamala's) + 5x (Alba's) = 9x.

We know that she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn. Since she mowed 9x lawns in total, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 9x * 6 = 54x.

We are given that she made a total of $80 from both lemonade sales and mowing lawns. So, the amount she made from lemonade sales is 80 - 54x.

However, we don't know the value of x. But we do know that she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, and that is a part of the 54x. Since she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, we can set up the equation 6 = 6x, which means x = 1.

Now that we know x = 1, we can find the amount she made from lemonade sales. The amount she made from lemonade sales is 80 - 54x = 80 - 54(1) = 80 - 54 = 26.

"To find the total amount John earns from renting his car, we need to calculate the total hours he rents his car and multiply it by his hourly rate.

He rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so the total hours he rents his car is 10 * 3 = 30 hours.

His hourly rate is $25, so the total amount he earns is 30 * $25 = $750.

Now, we need to subtract his car payment from the total amount he earns to find the profit.

Profit = Total earnings - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500

"Let's break down the information given. Martha initially had some notebooks, but we don't know the exact number. However, we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha. 

Let's denote the number of notebooks Martha had initially as 'x'. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, Joseph had 3x notebooks.

Martha bought 5 more notebooks, so now she has x + 5 notebooks.

We are also given that after buying 5 more notebooks, Martha had a total of 7 notebooks. This means that x + 5 = 7.

To find the value of x, we can solve the equation x + 5 = 7. Subtracting 5 from both sides gives us x = 2.

Now that we know Martha had 2 notebooks initially, we can find out how many notebooks Joseph had. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has: 7 - 6 = 1.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bowls of soup Calvin's family will use for dinner and then find out how many times the leftover soup can fill the child's bowls.

Calvin, his wife, and their two children make a total of 4 adults and 2 children, which is 6 people. Since everyone eats one bowl at a meal, they will use 6 bowls for dinner.

The pot can fill 4 adult's bowls or 8 child's bowls. Since 6 bowls were used for dinner, we need to find the equivalent in child's bowls. We can set up a proportion to find this out:

4 adult's bowls = 8 child's bowls
6 adult's bowls = x child's bowls

To solve for x, we can set up a proportion and cross-multiply:

4/8 = 6/x
4x = 6 * 8
4x = 48
x = 48 / 4
x = 12

So, the pot can fill 12 child's bowls. Since 2 children will be eating 2 bowls each for dinner, 4 bowls will be used. This leaves 12 - 4 = 8 child's bowls of soup for lunch.

Since there are 2 children, and there are 8 child's bowls of soup left, each child can have 8 / 2 = 4 bowls of soup for lunch.

"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to calculate the total amount of material required for small and large masks separately and then add them together.

For small masks, Jo needs 2 yards of material for each 4 masks. To make 20 small masks, she will need:
20 small masks / 4 small masks per 2 yards = 5 sets of 4 small masks
Since each set requires 2 yards, she will need 5 * 2 = 10 yards for small masks.

For large masks, Jo needs 2.25 yards of material for each 3 masks. To make 8 large masks, she will need:
8 large masks / 3 large masks per 2.25 yards = 2.67 sets of 3 large masks (round up to 3 sets since you can't have a fraction of a set)
Since each set requires 2.25 yards, she will need 3 * 2.25 = 6.75 yards for large masks.

Now, let's add the material needed for small and large masks together:
10 yards (small masks) + 6.75 yards (large masks) = 16.75 yards

The final answer is: 16.75"

"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we first need to calculate how many marbles he gave away. 

Dean gives 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie. Since he has 30 marbles, we multiply 30 by 1/5 to find out how many marbles he gave to Jamie. 

30 * 1/5 = 30 / 5 = 6 marbles given to Jamie.

Dean also gives 10 marbles to Donald.

So, in total, Dean gave away 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we subtract the marbles he gave away from the total number of marbles he had initially.

30 (initial marbles) - 16 (marbles given away) = 14 marbles left for Dean.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write an equation:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 2 * Adam's age four years ago
Duncan's age eight years ago = 2x

We know that Duncan's current age is 60, so we can find his age eight years ago by subtracting 8 from 60:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 60 - 8
Duncan's age eight years ago = 52

Now we can equate this to 2x:

52 = 2x

To find x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 52 / 2
x = 26

This means Adam's age four years ago was 26. To find Adam's current age, we add 4 to x:

Adam's current age = x + 4
Adam's current age = 26 + 4
Adam's current age = 30

Finally, to find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = Adam's current age + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 38

"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to first determine how many packages he completes in that time. 

Since he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, we can express this as an equation: 
Packages per hour = 50 - 10
Packages per hour = 40

Now, we multiply the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours he works in a day:
Packages per day = Packages per hour * Hours per day
Packages per day = 40 * 8
Packages per day = 320

Now, we multiply the number of packages he completes per day by the amount he gets paid per package:
Total earnings per day = Packages per day * Pay per package
Total earnings per day = 320 * 0.20
Total earnings per day = 64

"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the time it takes to solve the extreme sudoku and then divide it by the time it takes to drink one bottle of water.

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so the time to solve an extreme sudoku is 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to convert the time to solve the extreme sudoku to hours and then divide by 0.5 (since there are 2 half hours in an hour). 

180 minutes is equal to 3 hours. 

Now, we divide 3 hours by 0.5 to get the number of half hours, which is 6. 

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, he drinks 6 bottles of water in 3 hours.

"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in 30 days. 

Since Jon drives 100 miles a day, the total miles driven in 30 days is 100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles.

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs.

3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total hours Bruce works in the three days, we need to calculate the hours he works each day and add them up.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, which is 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours he works each day: 5 (Tuesday) + 10 (Wednesday) + 8 (Thursday) = 23 hours.

The final answer is: 23"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of money Julia and Nadine had, and then divide it by 2 to find out how much each of them received as allowance.

First, let's find the cost of the balloons. 1 dozen balloons is equal to 12 balloons. Since 2 balloons cost $0.5, 1 balloon costs $0.5 / 2 = $0.25. Therefore, 12 balloons cost 12 * $0.25 = $3.

The total cost of the cake and the balloons is $11 + $3 = $14. The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is $7 * 2 = $14. 

Since the total cost of the cake, balloons, and ice cream is $14, and this is the amount of money they spent, the remaining money is also $14. 

So, the total amount of money Julia and Nadine had is $14 (spent) + $14 (remaining) = $28.

Since they both received the same amount of allowance, we divide the total amount by 2 to find out how much each of them received: $28 / 2 = $14.

The final answer is: $14"
"To find out how many pieces of fruit are left, we need to first calculate the total number of fruits Kira bought. 

Kira bought 3 apples, 5 bananas, and 6 oranges. 

Total number of fruits = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14

Lola ate 2 pieces of the fruit. 

Number of fruits left = Total number of fruits - Number of fruits eaten

"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer, and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of students playing tennis. There are 6 students playing tennis, and twice that number are playing volleyball. So, the number of students playing volleyball is 6 * 2 = 12.

Now, let's add the number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer. The number of students playing soccer is 16 boys + 22 girls = 38.

So, the total number of students is 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56.

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total profit made by the class, we need to first find the total number of lollipops sold and the total cost of the lollipops.

Each student sold 10 lollipops, and there are 30 students. So, the total number of lollipops sold is:
10 lollipops/student * 30 students = 300 lollipops

The cost of each lollipop is $0.5, and the selling price is $0.8. The profit per lollipop is:
Profit per lollipop = Selling price - Cost per lollipop
= $0.8 - $0.5
= $0.3

Now, we can find the total profit by multiplying the profit per lollipop by the total number of lollipops sold:
Total profit = Profit per lollipop * Total number of lollipops
= $0.3 * 300
= $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

$90"
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and add them up.

Larry has 3 cats.

He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47

"To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to determine how many slices each person eats per day and then calculate the total number of slices they eat together per day.

Abby eats 2 slices a day. 
Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 * 2 = 4 slices a day.

Together, they eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices per day.

The loaf of bread has 24 slices. To find out how many days it will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat per day: 24 / 6 = 4.

"To find out how many shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and we want to know the total by her 10th birthday, we need to count the months from her 5th birthday to her 10th birthday.

There are 12 months in a year. From her 5th birthday to her 10th birthday, there are 5 years. 

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects one shell every month, we multiply the total number of months by 1 shell/month.

60 months * 1 shell/month = 60 shells

Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

60"
"To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we first need to determine the total number of cups of chamomile and mint tea. Since Lana divides the 27 cups into 3 rows with equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea, we can assume that each row has x cups of chamomile and x cups of mint tea. 

The total number of cups of chamomile and mint tea is 2x * 3 = 6x. Since Lana has 27 cups in total, the remaining cups for cinnamon tea are 27 - 6x. We are given that the remaining cups for cinnamon tea are 15. 

We can set up the equation 27 - 6x = 15 to solve for x. 

27 - 6x = 15
-6x = -12
x = 2

Since x represents the number of cups of chamomile and mint tea in each row, and we know that each row has equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is x = 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip. 

Let's break down the information given:

- The sloth takes 4 hours to make a round trip (down and back up) to collect berries.
- The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

Since the sloth takes 4 hours for a round trip, in 8 hours, he can make 8 / 4 = 2 round trips.

If he makes 2 round trips, he will collect a total of 2 * x berries, where x is the number of berries he picks up per trip.

We want to find the minimum value of x such that 2 * x = 24.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 12.

So, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the amount of water in the tank after 6 days, we first need to determine how much water is initially transferred to the tank from the pool. Since they fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool, we calculate this as:

10000 gallons (pool) / 2 = 5000 gallons (initial water in the tank)

Next, we need to find out how much water is used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so over 6 days, the total water used is:

500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons

Now, we subtract the water used from the initial amount in the tank to find the remaining water:

5000 gallons (initial water in the tank) - 3000 gallons (water used) = 2000 gallons

The final answer is: 2000"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much money Colby has left and then determine how many movies he can see with the remaining money.

Colby's initial budget is $150. He has already spent money on:

- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total money spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Colby has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Since tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10, and he wants to see a movie on a Friday, he can see 1 more movie with his remaining money.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we first need to find the calories of a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin. 

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories. 

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, we can find the total calories of the mini cinnamon rolls: 200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories = 40,000 calories.

Next, we can find the total calories of the mini blueberry muffins: 300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories = 45,000 calories.

Finally, we can find the total calories of all the pastries: 40,000 calories + 45,000 calories = 85,000 calories.

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to find the total number of Junebugs she removed and then divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, so 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Tuesday, so 2 * 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378

There are 5 days in total. 

Average number of Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days
= 378 / 5

"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled and then find the difference between the two distances.

The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. To find the distance traveled by the bus, we multiply the speed by the time: 
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 300 miles

The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. To find the distance traveled by the car, we multiply the speed by the time:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 8 hours
Distance = 240 miles

Now, we need to find the difference between the distance traveled by the bus and the car:
Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car
Difference = 300 miles - 240 miles
Difference = 60 miles

The bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls from the total number of toys she has now.

The total number of toys before buying the bouncy balls is the sum of the blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings. 

Total toys before = 31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48

Now, we subtract this from the total number of toys after buying the bouncy balls to find the number of bouncy balls.

Number of bouncy balls = Total toys after - Total toys before
= 62 - 48
= 14

"Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as Pp, and John's age as J. 

We are given that Pp = J + 10. 

We are also given that P = Pp + J.

We are also given that P + Pp + J = 100.

Substituting Pp from the first equation into the second equation, we get P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10.

Substituting P and Pp into the third equation, we get (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100.

Combine like terms: 4J + 20 = 100.

Subtract 20 from both sides: 4J = 80.

Divide both sides by 4: J = 20.

Now that we know J, we can find Pp: Pp = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30.

Now that we know Pp, we can find P: P = Pp + J = 30 + 20 = 50.

"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria had 1 water balloon, and her 4 friends had 2 balloons each. So, the total initial number of balloons is:
1 (Maria's balloon) + (4 friends * 2 balloons per friend) = 1 + 8 = 9 balloons

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total additional balloons are:
5 people * 3 balloons per person = 15 balloons

Now, we add the initial and additional balloons to find the total number of balloons:
9 (initial balloons) + 15 (additional balloons) = 24 balloons

"To determine which widget maker is more profitable, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month and then multiply that by the price of each widget.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month:

Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets
WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from each machine:

Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

Now, let's find the difference in revenue between the two machines:

$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

So, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 than from the WidgetMaster 9000.

"To find out how much hay Nate needs, we first need to determine the amount each sheep needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Twice the amount each goat needs: 2 * 5 = 10 pounds
3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs: 10 - 3 = 7 pounds

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately:

Total hay for goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds
Total hay for sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

To find the total amount of hay Nate needs, we add the total hay for the goats and the sheep:

Total hay needed = 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds

"To find the total number of letters in the words Craig spelled, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word: 20 * 15 = 300.

Since Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, we add 50 to the total number of letters Craig spelled: 300 + 50 = 350.

Now, we need to find the number of letters in the words Craig's brother spelled. Since Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, and Craig spelled 20 words with 15 letters each, we can find the number of words Craig's brother spelled by adding 1 to the number of words Craig spelled: 20 + 1 = 21. 

Now, we multiply the number of words Craig's brother spelled by the number of letters in each word: 21 * 15 = 315.

Finally, we add the total number of letters in the words Craig spelled and the words Craig's brother spelled to find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds: 300 + 315 = 615.

"To find the total amount Patty charged, we need to calculate the labor cost and add it to the cost of parts and the initial visit fee.

The labor cost is $35 per hour, and the job took 2.25 hours. Since the labor is charged per hour or part thereof, we need to round up to the nearest hour for the labor cost. However, in this case, we can simply multiply the labor rate by the number of hours worked, which is 2.25.

Labor cost = $35 * 2.25 = $78.75

The cost of parts is $60.

The initial visit fee is $40.

Now, we add the labor cost, parts cost, and the initial visit fee to find the total amount charged.

Total amount = Labor cost + Parts cost + Initial visit fee
Total amount = $78.75 + $60 + $40
Total amount = $178.75

"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we need to calculate the original price and then subtract the discount. 

The original price of 10 CDs at $15 each is 10 * $15 = $150.

Since James got a 40% discount, we need to find 40% of $150. 
40% of $150 is 0.4 * $150 = $60.

So, the discounted price is $150 - $60 = $90.

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each, so he made 5 * $40 = $200.

However, he spent $90 on the CDs and made $200 from selling 5 of them. To find out how much money he was out, we need to subtract the amount he made from the amount he spent. 

But first, we need to find out how much he spent on the remaining 5 CDs. Since he got a 40% discount, the price of each CD is $15 - ($15 * 0.4) = $15 - $6 = $9.

So, the total amount he spent on the remaining 5 CDs is 5 * $9 = $45.

Now, we can find out how much money he was out by subtracting the amount he made from the total amount he spent. 
Total amount spent = $90 (on all 10 CDs) + $45 (on the remaining 5 CDs) = $135.
Amount made = $200.

So, James was out by $135 - $200 = -$65. However, since we can't be out by a negative amount, we need to find the difference between the amount he made and the amount he spent on the remaining CDs. 

The correct calculation is: 
Amount he was out = Amount spent on all CDs - Amount made from selling 5 CDs
Amount he was out = $90 + $45 - $200
Amount he was out = $135 - $200
Amount he was out = -$65
Amount he was out = $200 - $135
Amount he was out = $65

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the time it took James to swim 60% of the distance. 

Distance = 20 miles
Speed = 2 miles per hour
Time = Distance / Speed = 20 / 2 = 10 hours

60% of the distance is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. 
Time taken to swim 12 miles = 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

Since he rested for half as long as the swimming time, he rested for 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, let's find the time it took him to swim the remaining distance. 
Remaining distance = 20 - 12 = 8 miles
New speed = 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour
Time = Distance / Speed = 8 / 1 = 8 hours

Total time = Time taken to swim 12 miles + Time taken to rest + Time taken to swim the remaining distance
Total time = 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours

"Let's break down the information given. 

Deanna is 26 years old. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old.

Since Marcus is half of Leo's age, we can set up an equation to find Leo's age: 

Let L be Leo's age. 
Marcus's age is half of Leo's age, so 21 = L/2.

To find Leo's age, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2: 
L = 21 * 2
L = 42

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Bahati and Dinar. 

Let's denote the points scored by Dinar as x. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati's points can be represented as x + 10. 

We also know that Azibo scored 20 more points than Bahati, so Azibo's points can be represented as (x + 10) + 20 = x + 30.

The total points scored by the team is 45, which is the sum of the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + (x + 10) + (x + 30) = 45.

Combine like terms: 3x + 40 = 45.

Subtract 40 from both sides: 3x = 5.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 5/3.

However, x represents the points scored by Dinar, which cannot be a fraction. This indicates that the initial assumption of x being the points scored by Dinar is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Let's denote the points scored by Dinar as x. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so Bahati's points can be represented as x + 10. Azibo scored 20 more points than Bahati, so Azibo's points can be represented as (x + 10) + 20 = x + 30.

The total points scored by the team is 45, which is the sum of the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + (x + 10) + (x + 30) = 45.

Combine like terms: 3x + 40 = 45.

Subtract 40 from both sides: 3x = 5.

"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book in inches.

Since each paper is 100 pages to the inch and each paper is printed on both sides, we have 200 pages per inch (100 pages per side).

Given that the book is 1.5 inches thick, we can multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book:

200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 300 pages

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total time he spent stapling reports and then multiply it by the number of reports he can staple per minute.

First, let's find the total time in minutes. Vince stapled reports from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. 

15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many reports he can staple per minute, we divide 30 by 15.

30 reports / 15 minutes = 2 reports/minute

Now, we multiply the total minutes by the number of reports he can staple per minute.

900 minutes * 2 reports/minute = 1800 reports

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. This is a total of 8 hours, which is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m. This means she slept from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m., which is a total of 7 hours and 55 minutes. 

To convert this to minutes, we multiply 7 hours by 60 and add 55 minutes: 7 * 60 = 420 + 55 = 475 minutes.

Now, we need to subtract the time she was sleepwalking, which was from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. This is a total of 23 minutes.

So, the total time she slept on her bed is 475 - 23 = 452 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. 

Since Jonathan has two dozen cups, and one dozen is equal to 12, he has 2 * 12 = 24 measuring cups.

It is given that Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. So, the number of measuring spoons he has is 2/3 * 24 = 16.

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons.

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons, which is 24 + 10 = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we first need to find the number of occupied beds and then subtract it from the total capacity.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied. 

1/5 of 1000 is 100. So, the number of occupied beds is 100.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we need to find the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks have 14 days.

The total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks is 50 * 14 = 700.

Now, we add the initial occupied beds and the beds occupied in 2 weeks: 100 + 700 = 800.

The number of unoccupied beds is the total capacity minus the occupied beds: 1000 - 800 = 200.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we first need to find out how many emails are not work-related. 

Robyn sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to her family. Two-thirds of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6. This means 6 emails are to her family.

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after subtracting the family emails from the non-work emails. 9 - 6 = 3.

One-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend. One-third of 3 is (1/3) * 3 = 1.

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

We know that Aliya is 3 years old. We also know that Shawna is three times as old as Aliya. 

So, Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age = 3 * 3 = 9 years.

We also know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. 

So, Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age = 5 * 9 = 45 years.

"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from the number she reported.

Let's assume the number Courtney reported is 100%. 
20% of 100 is 20.

Now, we subtract 20 from 100 to find the actual percentage of people who attended the concert.
100 - 20 = 80%

Now, we need to find 80% of the number Courtney reported, which is 48.
80% of 48 = (80/100) * 48 = 0.8 * 48 = 38.4

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is: 38.4"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that Jason carried 2 balls, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. This means Jeffrey carried half the number of balls Jason carried, which is 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them: 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

However, this is the number of balls the boys carried, not the total number of balls the coach brought to practice. Since the boys carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is equal to the number of balls the boys carried.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day, we need to add the holes dug each day and subtract the two holes filled in. 

Holes dug on the first day = 10
Holes dug on the second day = 13
Holes dug on the third day = 8
Holes filled in on the third day = 2

Total holes by the end of the third day = 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since the island had 10 holes at the end of the first day, it had 4 * 10 = 40 holes by the end of the fourth day.

Since the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is 40, and the total number of holes by the end of the third day is 29, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 40 - 29 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and the third person got 15 more than each of them. 

Let's denote the number of corn chips the third person got as x. Since the third person got 15 more than Amora and Lainey, we can write an equation:

x = 70 + 15
x = 85

So, the third person got 85 corn chips. 

Now, we know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and the third person got 85 corn chips. To find the total number of corn chips, we add the number of corn chips each person got:

Total corn chips = 70 + 70 + 85
Total corn chips = 225

"To find the total cost of travel, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of supplies. 

First, let's find 50% of the cost of supplies. 50% of $400 is 0.5 * 400 = $200.

Now, we add this to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel. 
Total cost of travel = cost of supplies + 50% of cost of supplies
Total cost of travel = $400 + $200
Total cost of travel = $600

The final answer is: $600"
"Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as X. 

We know that X = S + 5 (Alex has caught 5 more than Stan). 

We also know that S = 4A - 13 (Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe).

We can substitute the value of S from the second equation into the first equation: X = (4A - 13) + 5.

We also know that X + S + A = 339 (Together they have caught 339 Pokémon).

Now we can substitute the value of X from the first equation into the third equation: (4A - 13 + 5) + S + A = 339.

Simplifying the equation: 4A + A - 8 + S = 339.

Combine like terms: 5A + S - 8 = 339.

We can substitute the value of S from the second equation into the equation: 5A + (4A - 13) - 8 = 339.

Simplifying the equation: 5A + 4A - 13 - 8 = 339.

Combine like terms: 9A - 21 = 339.

Add 21 to both sides: 9A = 360.

Divide both sides by 9: A = 40.

Now that we know A, we can find S: S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147.

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and then add it to the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the southerly direction for the first 10 hours:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours
Distance = 300 miles

Then, the bird flies towards the north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 36 miles

Since the bird is flying north, this distance is subtracted from the total southerly distance:
Total southerly distance = 300 miles - 36 miles
Total southerly distance = 264 miles

Finally, the bird flies towards the south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 110 miles

To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we add the total southerly distance and the distance traveled in the final southerly direction:
Total distance = Total southerly distance + Distance in the final southerly direction
Total distance = 264 miles + 110 miles
Total distance = 374 miles

She received 1/2 dozen brownies from her office, which is 6 brownies. 
She received 4 dozen brownies from her friends, which is 48 brownies.

Total brownies received = 12 + 6 + 48 = 66

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

Total brownies eaten = 18

To find the total number of brownies Greta had left over, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies received:
Total brownies left over = Total brownies received - Total brownies eaten
Total brownies left over = 66 - 18
Total brownies left over = 48

For synthetic gut racquets: 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes
For polyester string racquets: 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes
For hybrid sets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

Now, we add the time for each type of string together: 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes

The total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets is 227 minutes."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first two phones and the remaining phones. 

The first two phones cost the full price of $600 each, so the total cost for the first two phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.

The remaining phones are 2 (for the kids and his wife), and each of these phones is half the price of the first two, which is $600 / 2 = $300.

The total cost for the remaining phones is 2 * $300 = $600.

Now, we add the cost of the first two phones and the remaining phones to get the total cost: $1200 + $600 = $1800.

The final answer is: $1800"
"To find the total number of players in both teams, we first need to determine the number of players in Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players in Zeke's team by adding 7 to 13.

Zeke's team = Carlton's team + 7
Zeke's team = 13 + 7
Zeke's team = 20

Now, we can find the total number of players in both teams by adding the number of players in Zeke's team and Carlton's team.

Total players = Zeke's team + Carlton's team
Total players = 20 + 13
Total players = 33

The final answer is: 33"
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2 * (length + width).

Given the length (L) is 15 feet and the width (W) is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (L + W)
Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

Total slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total slats needed = 50 * 2
Total slats needed = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we first need to determine how many oranges she had initially and then subtract the ones she kept and gave away.

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges. So, the total number of oranges she bought is 12 * 20 = 240.

She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each, which is a total of 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, she gave away 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

Now, she kept 1/4 of the oranges. To find out how many oranges that is, we need to calculate 1/4 of the total number of oranges she bought, which is 240. 

1/4 of 240 is 240 / 4 = 60. 

So, she kept 60 oranges. 

Now, we subtract the oranges she kept and the ones she gave away from the total number of oranges she bought to find out how many she sold. 

240 (total oranges) - 60 (kept) - 80 (given away) = 100 oranges.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the total number of states in both countries, we first need to determine the number of states in each country. 

The USA has 50 states. 

Half of 50 is 25. 

India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, so India has 25 + 4 = 29 states.

Now, we add the number of states in the USA and India together: 50 + 29 = 79.

The total number of states in both countries together is 79."
"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books. 

The total cost of the books is the sum of the cost of the dictionary, the dinosaur book, and the children's cookbook. 

Total cost = $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) 
Total cost = $39

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, we need to subtract this from the total cost to find out how much more he needs to earn.

Amount needed to earn = Total cost - Amount saved
Amount needed to earn = $39 - $14
Amount needed to earn = $25

Now, we know that Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the amount he needs to earn by his hourly wage.

Hours needed to work = Amount needed to earn / Hourly wage
Hours needed to work = $25 / $5
Hours needed to work = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many cherries Robert has more than Jerry, we first need to determine how many cherries Richard and Jerry have. 

Since Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more than Richard, we can find out how many cherries Richard has by subtracting 10 from Robert's total: 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.

Now, we know that the total number of cherries is 60. We already know that Robert and Richard have 30 and 20 cherries respectively. To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we subtract the total number of cherries that Robert and Richard have from the total number of cherries: 60 - 30 - 20 = 10 cherries.

Now that we know how many cherries Richard and Jerry have, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry by subtracting Jerry's total from Robert's total: 30 - 10 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the information given:

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. 
On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.

On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. 
On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. 
So, on Saturday, he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each day:

On Saturday, the total earnings from gingerbread = 10 * $6 = $60
The total earnings from apple pie = 11 * $15 = $165
Total earnings on Saturday = $60 + $165 = $225

On Sunday, the total earnings from gingerbread = 15 * $6 = $90
The total earnings from apple pie = 15 * $15 = $225
Total earnings on Sunday = $90 + $225 = $315

Total earnings for two days = $225 + $315 = $540

The final answer is: $540"
"To determine the total amount of sunscreen needed, we need to calculate the total number of hours Pamela will be outside and then multiply it by the amount of sunscreen she reapplies each hour.

Pamela will be outside 4 hours a day for 8 days. So, the total number of hours she will be outside is:
4 hours/day * 8 days = 32 hours

Since Pamela reapplies an ounce of sunscreen every hour, she will need:
32 hours * 1 ounce/hour = 32 ounces of sunscreen

Each bottle of sunscreen contains 8 ounces. To find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total amount of sunscreen needed by the amount in each bottle:
32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen for her vacation.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

First, let's find 40% of the price of the blue car:
40% of $100 = 0.4 * $100 = $40

Now, subtract $40 from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car:
$100 - $40 = $60

So, the price of the red car is $60.

The price of the blue car is $100, and the price of the red car is $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Emil is 19 years old now. When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad and twice as old as his brother. 

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B. 

We know that E = 19. 

When Emil turns 24, his age will be 24. 

We are given two conditions: 
1. 24 = 0.5D 
2. 24 = 2B 

From condition 1, we can find D: 
D = 24 * 2 
D = 48 

From condition 2, we can find B: 
B = 24 / 2 
B = 12 

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother now. 
Dad's current age = D - (24 - E) 
= 48 - (24 - 19) 
= 43 

Brother's current age = B - (24 - E) 
= 12 - (24 - 19) 
= 7 

Sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother now = 43 + 7 
= 50

"To find out how many beads Adrianne has altogether, we need to calculate the number of beads she received from her mother, sister, and friend, and then add them together.

Adrianne's mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day and add them together.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by 3: 21 / 3 = 7.

"To find the number of students who are football players, we first need to calculate 20% of 30. 

20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6

So, there are 6 football players in the class. 

Now, we need to find the number of remaining students. 
Remaining students = Total students - Football players
Remaining students = 30 - 6
Remaining students = 24

Next, we need to find the number of students who are cheerleaders or part of the band. 
25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band. 
25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6

So, there are 6 students who are cheerleaders or part of the band.

The total number of students leaving early is the sum of football players and cheerleaders or band members.
Total students leaving early = Football players + Cheerleaders or band members
Total students leaving early = 6 + 6

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we first need to determine Charlie's shoe size. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size five boots, we can calculate Charlie's size as follows:

Charlie's size = 5 * Sophie's size
Charlie's size = 5 * 5
Charlie's size = 25

Now, we can find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie by adding their sizes and dividing by 2:

Average size = (Sophie's size + Charlie's size) / 2
Average size = (5 + 25) / 2
Average size = 30 / 2
Average size = 15

"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to first convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches, since the width of the plants is given in inches. 

1 foot is equal to 12 inches, so 111 feet is equal to 111 * 12 = 1332 inches.

Now, we need to subtract the space between the plants. Since there are 17 plants, there will be 16 spaces between them. The total space between the plants is 16 * 1.5 = 24 feet, which is equal to 24 * 12 = 288 inches.

Now, we subtract the total space between the plants from the total length of the flower bed: 1332 - 288 = 1044 inches.

Since each plant is 12 inches wide, we can divide the total available space by the width of a plant to find out how many plants can fit: 1044 / 12 = 87.

However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so we need to subtract 17 from the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed to find out how many more plants she needs to buy: 87 - 17 = 70.

Each plant costs $6, so the total amount Pat will spend at the store is 70 * 6 = $420.

The final answer is: $420"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day, we need to calculate 1/2 of the number of pretzels Edgar eats in a day. 

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. 
1/2 of 18 is 18 / 2 = 9 pretzels.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to multiply the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day by 7.

9 pretzels/day * 7 days = 63 pretzels

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of petunias: 
5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket = 15 petunias
Cost of 15 petunias = 15 * $3.00 = $45.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of sweet potato vines:
5 baskets * 2 sweet potato vines per basket = 10 sweet potato vines
Cost of 10 sweet potato vines = 10 * $2.50 = $25.00

Now, let's add the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines together:
Total cost = $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we first need to calculate how much she saves each month. 

Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets 25% of her paycheck aside for shoes. To find 25% of $2,000.00, we multiply $2,000.00 by 0.25.

$2,000.00 * 0.25 = $500.00

So, Jessica saves $500.00 each month for shoes.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly savings by 12 to find the yearly savings.

$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy with her yearly savings. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp. 

First, let's find out how long it takes her to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, we can divide 90 by 6 to get the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. 

90 / 6 = 15 minutes

Now, let's find out how long it takes her to cook 90 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can divide 90 by 30 to find out how many sets of 30 shrimp she needs to cook. 

90 / 30 = 3

Since it takes her 10 minutes to cook one set of 30 shrimp, it will take her 3 times 10 minutes to cook 90 shrimp. 

3 * 10 = 30 minutes

However, we need to add the time it takes her to peel the shrimp to the time it takes her to cook them. 

15 + 30 = 45 minutes

So, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

The final answer is: 45"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in temperature after the air conditioner has been running and turned off.

First, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner is running on low for 3 hours:

Temperature change on low = -2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = -6 degrees

Then, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner is running on high for 4 hours:

Temperature change on high = -3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = -12 degrees

Now, let's calculate the total temperature change when the air conditioner is running:

Total temperature change while running = -6 degrees + (-12 degrees) = -18 degrees

The air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, so the room will warm up by 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the net temperature change:

Net temperature change = Total temperature change while running - Temperature change while off = -18 degrees - 4 degrees = -22 degrees

Since the net temperature change is -22 degrees, the final temperature is 22 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how old Bill's dad was when he saw the comet for the first time, and then use that information to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time.

Let's denote the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet as 'x'. Since Bill saw the comet when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, Bill's age at that time is 3x.

We know that the time between two sightings of the comet is 75 years. So, the difference in age between the two sightings is 75 years. 

When Bill saw the comet for the second time, his age was 3x, and his dad's age was x. The difference in their ages is 2x. Since this difference is equal to 75 years, we can write the equation:

2x = 75

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 75 / 2
x = 37.5

Now that we know Bill's dad was 37.5 years old when he saw the comet, we can find Bill's age at that time. Since Bill was 30 years old when his dad saw the comet, we can write the equation:

Bill's age when his dad saw the comet = 30

However, we are asked to find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, and Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 37.5 years old, we need to subtract 75 years from 37.5 to find Bill's age when his dad saw the comet. However, this is not the answer we are looking for. We are looking for Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time. 

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 37.5 years old, and the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we need to find out how many times the comet has orbited the sun since Bill's dad saw it. We can do this by dividing 75 by 75, which equals 1. This means the comet has orbited the sun once since Bill's dad saw it.

Now, we need to find Bill's age when the comet first appeared. We know that Bill was 30 years old when his dad saw the comet. Since the comet has orbited the sun once since then, we need to subtract 75 years from 30 to find Bill's age when the comet first appeared. However, this is not the correct approach.

"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each category and then add them together.

1. Checks for the electric bill: 12 months/year * 1 check/month = 12 checks/year
2. Checks for the gas bill: 12 months/year * 1 check/month = 12 checks/year
3. Checks to the church: 12 months/year * 2 checks/month = 24 checks/year
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 4 quarters/year * 1 check/quarter = 4 checks/year

Now, let's add the total number of checks: 
12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52 checks/year

The final answer is: 52"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane in a day as 'x'. 

Since the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, the number of flights to Greece is (3/4)x. 

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is (1/4)x, and the number of flights to Germany is also (1/4)x.

The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes in a day. So, the number of flights made by the first plane in a day is 2 * 44 = 88.

Now, we know that the first plane makes 88 flights in a day. We can set up an equation to find the number of flights to France:

(1/4)x = flights to France
x = 88 (total flights)
(1/4) * 88 = flights to France

To find the number of flights to France, we multiply 88 by 1/4.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the individual howling times and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"Let's break down the information given. Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is 2 * $6 = $12. 

So, the total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since Adam bought the trousers for $30, we need to find out how much he had to contribute from his savings. To do this, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the total cost of the trousers: $30 - $18 = $12.

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings.

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's denote the age of Wilfred as 'W'. Since Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, we can express this as:

Helene's age = 2 * (Average age of the group)

We know that the total age of the children is 20, and there are 4 children. The average age of the group can be calculated as:

Average age of the group = Total age / Number of children
= 20 / 4
= 5

Now, we can express Helene's age in terms of the average age:

Helene's age = 2 * Average age of the group
= 2 * 5
= 10

We also know that Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. The total age of the group is the sum of their ages and Wilfred's age:

Total age = Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age
20 = 3 + 4 + 10 + W

Now, we can solve for W:

20 = 17 + W
W = 20 - 17
W = 3

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we first need to calculate the total amount collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund. 

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. 

Total amount collected so far = $500 + $1500 = $2000

Walter's friend donates $200, but we are not considering this amount for the lawyer's donation. We are only considering the donations from the neighbors and the online fund.

Now, we are told that Walter's lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates. The ""everyone else"" refers to the neighbors and the online fund, not including Walter's friend.

So, the lawyer will donate 3 times the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, which is $2000.

Lawyer's donation = 3 * $2000 = $6000

The final answer is: $6000"
"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we first need to find out the total number of cookies. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is 1500 * 1/2 = 750.

Now, we know that each person in the church got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church, we need to divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got. 

Number of people in the church = Total cookies given to the church / Number of cookies per person
= 750 / 15
= 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, let's assume the total number of slices the watermelon is divided into is 'x'. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is 6. 

Let's say each kid gets 'k' slices. Since each adult gets twice as big a slice as each kid, each adult gets 2k slices. 

We know that the total number of slices is 6, so we can set up the equation: 2k + 4k = 6. 

Combine like terms: 6k = 6.

Divide both sides by 6: k = 1.

Now that we know each kid gets 1 slice, each adult gets 2 slices. 

The total number of slices the adults get is 2 * 2 = 4.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to divide the number of slices they get by the total number of slices and multiply by 100.

(4 / 6) * 100 = 66.67%

The final answer is: 66.67"
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we first need to calculate the total time he spends on rounds and appointments.

Time spent on rounds: 
- Number of inpatients: 9
- Time per inpatient: 20 minutes
- Total time spent on rounds: 9 * 20 = 180 minutes

Time spent on appointments: 
- Number of appointments: 10
- Time per appointment: 30 minutes
- Total time spent on appointments: 10 * 30 = 300 minutes

Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 + 300 = 480 minutes

Since Doctor Jones works for 9 hours at the clinic, we need to convert this to minutes: 
- 9 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 540 minutes

Now, we subtract the total time spent on rounds and appointments from the total time he works: 
- 540 minutes - 480 minutes = 60 minutes

To convert the remaining time back to hours: 
- 60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

So, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records.

The final answer is: 1"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake. 

First, let's add the time it takes to make the cake batter and bake the cake: 20 minutes + 30 minutes = 50 minutes.

Next, we add the time it takes for the cake to cool: 50 minutes + 2 hours = 2 hours 50 minutes.

Then, we add the time it takes to frost the cake: 2 hours 50 minutes + 10 minutes = 3 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 3 hours to minutes: 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.

Now, we add the remaining 50 minutes: 180 minutes + 50 minutes = 230 minutes.

To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to subtract the total time from the desired serving time. Since she wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we'll convert this to minutes: 5:00 pm = 5 * 60 minutes = 300 minutes (since it's 12:00 pm at the start of the day).

Now, we subtract the total time from the desired serving time: 300 minutes - 230 minutes = 70 minutes.

To find the latest start time, we convert 70 minutes back to hours and minutes: 70 minutes = 1 hour 10 minutes.

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 3:50 pm.

The final answer is 3:50."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to first find the total number of boxes sold by both Lisa and Peter. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. So, the total number of boxes sold is 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

Since they sold 64 chocolate bars together and they sold a total of 8 boxes, we can find the number of chocolate bars in a box by dividing the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes.

Number of chocolate bars in a box = Total number of chocolate bars / Total number of boxes
= 64 / 8
= 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of students per session, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

The studio is rented 3 days a week, so it's rented 3 x 4 = 12 days in a month (assuming a 4-week month).

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25. 
The cost of students per session is $1.50 per student, and there are 10 students, so the total cost of students per session is 10 x $1.50 = $15.

The total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $15 (students) = $40.

Since the studio is rented 12 days in a month, the total number of sessions in a month is 12.

The total earnings per month would be the total cost per session multiplied by the number of sessions in a month, which is $40 x 12 = $480.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $480.

$480"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box for Peter and Martha, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars they have by the number of boxes they have.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter is 64 / 4 = 16.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box for Martha is 56 / 7 = 8.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha. 

16 (Peter's chocolate bars per box) - 8 (Martha's chocolate bars per box) = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we multiply the total population by 3/5. 

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, we need to find the total number of babies born in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

Total babies born in a year = 30 * 4 * 12 = 1440

Now, we add the total number of babies born in a year to the initial population to find the total population after a year.

Total population after a year = 50 + 1440 = 1490

The final answer is: 1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the gallons of water needed, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. There are 7.48 gallons in a cubic foot, so:

Volume in gallons = 1400 * 7.48
Volume in gallons = 10472 gallons

Now, we multiply the volume in gallons by 5.9 to get the total gallons of water needed:
Total gallons = 10472 * 5.9
Total gallons = 61851.28 gallons

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the total gallons by the cost per gallon:
Cost = 61851.28 * 0.10
Cost = 6185.128

The final answer is: $6185.13"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to calculate the number of blue and yellow sticks first. 

We know there are 9 red sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how many miles each person traveled, we need to multiply their speed by the time they traveled.

Matteo's distance = speed * time = 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles

Shandy's distance = speed * time = 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, we need to find the difference between their distances to see how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo.

Difference = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the total number of female students, we first need to find the number of students over 16 and under 16, and then find the number of female students in each group.

Half of the students are over 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500 students.
One-fourth of the students over 16 are male: 1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16. 
So, the number of female students over 16 is 1500 - 375 = 1125.

The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500 students.
One-half of the students under 16 are male: 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16.
So, the number of female students under 16 is 1500 - 750 = 750.

Now, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16 to find the total number of female students: 1125 + 750 = 1875.

"To find out how many laps each person can run, we need to calculate their individual lap counts.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we need to subtract Quinn's lap count from Bethany's lap count: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on both days and then subtract that from the tank's capacity.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons. The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on both days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

The remaining amount of water needed to fill the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour for 5 hours, and the second part where it loses 7% of its capacity per hour for 3 hours.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x.

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the remaining charge will be x - (9% of x) * 5 = x - 0.45x = 0.55x.

Now, in the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the remaining charge will be 0.55x - (7% of 0.55x) * 3 = 0.55x - 0.1545x = 0.3955x.

We are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. So, we can set up the equation:

0.3955x = 0.28x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.3955:

x = 0.28 / 0.3955
x = 0.709

So, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 70.9%.

The final answer is: 70.9"
"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings. 

Her hourly wage is $10, and her hourly tips are $15. So, her total hourly earnings are $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1000.

Now, Janet wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car for the down payment. 20% of $10,000 is 0.2 * $10,000 = $2000.

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save the down payment, we divide the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her weekly earnings ($1000). 

$2000 / $1000 = 2.

So, Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has spent so far. 

3 peaches at $0.5 each will be 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
4 pears at $0.5 each will be 4 * $0.5 = $2
2 kiwis at $1 each will be 2 * $1 = $2
5 apples at $0.75 each will be 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Adding these amounts together, Jamaar has spent $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9 so far.

He started with $10, so he has $10 - $9 = $1 left.

Plums cost $0.25 each, so we can divide the remaining money by the cost of a plum to find out how many he can buy: $1 / $0.25 = 4.

"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of her friends received, we first need to find out how many packs of sweets Anne gave to her friends. 

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs to her friends.

Since she gave the packs equally to 10 friends, we divide the number of packs by 10: 13 / 10 = 1.3 packs per friend.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces of sweets are in 1.3 packs. Since each pack has 60 pieces, we multiply 1.3 by 60: 1.3 * 60 = 78.

However, since we can't divide sweets into fractions, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we can give 1 pack to each friend and then distribute the remaining packs. 

So, 13 - 10 = 3 packs are left. We can give 1 pack to each of the 10 friends, which is 10 packs. Now, we have 3 packs left. We can divide these 3 packs equally among the 10 friends: 3 / 10 = 0.3 packs per friend. 

Now, we multiply 0.3 by 60 to find out how many pieces of sweets each friend gets from the remaining packs: 0.3 * 60 = 18.

So, each friend gets 60 (from the 1 pack) + 18 (from the remaining packs) = 78 pieces of sweets.

The final answer is: 78"
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures by 8.

Total pictures = 72
Pictures per album = Total pictures / Number of albums
Pictures per album = 72 / 8
Pictures per album = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits, the remaining 3 albums must be a mix of both selfies and portraits. However, we are not given any information about the mix of selfies and portraits in these 3 albums. 

But we can still find the total number of selfies and portraits. Since 3 albums were selfies only, the total number of selfies is 3 * 9 = 27. Similarly, 2 albums were portraits only, so the total number of portraits is 2 * 9 = 18.

The final answer is:

"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to determine how many sets of 3 pages he reads and then multiply that by the time it takes him to read one set of 3 pages.

Since James reads 18 pages, we can divide 18 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 pages he reads: 18 / 3 = 6.

Now, we know it takes James 10 minutes to read one set of 3 pages. Since he reads 6 sets, we multiply 10 minutes by 6: 10 * 6 = 60.

James spends 60 minutes reading his book."
"To find the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to calculate the number of guests who checked in and subtract the number of guests who checked out.

Initially, there were 100 guests. 

24 guests checked out early, so the remaining guests are 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, so the number of guests who have checked out is 24 (early checkout) + 15 (late checkout) = 39.

The number of guests who have not checked out is 76 - 39 = 37.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30.

So, the total number of guests who have checked in is 30 (in the afternoon) + 7 (after dinner) = 37.

Now, we add the number of guests who have checked in to the number of guests who have not checked out: 37 (checked in) + 37 (not checked out) = 74.

The final answer is: 74"
"To find out how many bananas John has, we need to calculate the total number of bananas he picked. 

On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas. 
On Thursday, he picked 6 bananas. 
On Friday, he picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add up the total number of bananas John picked: 4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find out how many points Aries is sure to get, we first need to determine the number of each type of question in the quiz. 

There are 60 questions in total. 40% of them are easy, so the number of easy questions is 40% of 60, which is 0.4 * 60 = 24 questions. 

The rest of the questions are equally divided between average and difficult, so there are (60 - 24) / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 0.75 * 24 = 18 easy questions. She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 0.5 * 18 = 9 average questions and 0.5 * 18 = 9 difficult questions.

So, the total number of questions Aries is sure to get is 18 + 9 + 9 = 36.

The final answer is: 36"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say the number of large stuffed animals sold is L and the number of small stuffed animals sold is S. We know that S = 2L (since she sold twice as many small ones as large ones).

We also know that the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small one. Since each small stuffed animal costs $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total earnings from the sales is $120. The earnings from the large stuffed animals is $12L and the earnings from the small stuffed animals is $4S. Since S = 2L, we can substitute S with 2L in the earnings from small stuffed animals.

So, the total earnings equation becomes: $12L + $4(2L) = $120

Combine like terms: $12L + $8L = $120

Combine the L terms: $20L = $120

Divide both sides by $20: L = 6

Since S = 2L, S = 2 * 6 = 12

The number of small stuffed animals sold is 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches they eat in a day and then multiply it by 7.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, the wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and the son eats 2 sandwiches per day. 

Total sandwiches eaten per day = 5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day.

Now, we multiply the total sandwiches eaten per day by 7 to get the total sandwiches eaten in a week.

Total sandwiches eaten in a week = 11 sandwiches per day * 7 days = 77 sandwiches.

The final answer is: 77"
"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings and then subtract the amount she gave to her sisters.

First, let's calculate her earnings from selling cookies: 
80 cookies * $1 each = $80

Next, let's calculate her earnings from selling cupcakes: 
60 cupcakes * $4 each = $240

Now, let's add her earnings from cookies and cupcakes: 
$80 + $240 = $320

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave a total of: 
2 * $10 = $20

Now, let's subtract the amount she gave to her sisters from her total earnings: 
$320 - $20 = $300

The final answer is: $300"
"To find the number of eggs found by the friends, we first need to determine the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins. Since each of the twins found 30 eggs, the total number of eggs found by the twins is 2 * 30 = 60.

Now, we know that all the eggs except 10 were found by the twins and their friends. This means that the total number of eggs found by the twins and their friends is 100 - 10 = 90.

Since the twins found 60 eggs, the number of eggs found by the friends can be calculated by subtracting the number of eggs found by the twins from the total number of eggs found by the twins and their friends. 

So, the number of eggs found by the friends is 90 - 60 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then multiply it by 40 dwarves and 30 days.

First, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe. Since he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe as with his bare hands, he can mine 2 * 12 = 24 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe.

Now, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. He can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe. 50% of 24 pounds is 0.5 * 24 = 12 pounds. So, he can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes. 40 dwarves can mine 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds of ore per day.

Finally, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in 30 days with steel pickaxes. 1440 pounds per day * 30 days = 43200 pounds.

"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for the first two packages. 

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.5 per sandwich. 

The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.5 per sandwich. 

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is consistent across all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is $1.5.

To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches: $1.5 * 8 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to first calculate how much he still owes after selling his old bedroom set. 

The cost of the bedroom set is $3000, and he sells his old bedroom for $1000. 

So, the remaining amount he owes is $3000 - $1000 = $2000.

Since he has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we need to calculate 10% of $2000.

10% of $2000 = 0.1 * $2000 = $200.

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month. 

The final answer is: $200"
"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 40% of 25 is 0.4 * 25 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 12 / 2 = 6. So, 6 yellow balloons were released, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

Now, let's calculate the total number of balloons she carried into the school. She had 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons. 

Total number of balloons = 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34

"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the scenarios where he won't get an extension. 

First, let's find the probability that the substitute teacher won't collect the homework: 50% (chance of substitute teacher) * 100% (no extension from substitute) = 50%.

Next, let's find the probability that the normal teacher will come in and not give an extension: 50% (chance of normal teacher) * 80% (chance of no extension) = 40%.

Now, let's find the probability that the normal teacher will come in and Marcus won't get a personal extension: 50% (chance of normal teacher) * 60% (chance of no personal extension) = 30%.

The total probability that Marcus won't get an extension is the sum of the probabilities of the two scenarios: 50% (substitute teacher) + 30% (normal teacher no extension) = 80%.

To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we subtract the probability that he won't get an extension from 100%: 100% - 80% = 20%.

"To find out how many tickets each graduate can receive, we first need to determine the total number of available seats for guests. 

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center: 6000
Seats for graduates: 950
Seats for faculty: 300

Total seats taken: 950 + 300 = 1250
Available seats for guests: 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive.

4750 / 950 = 5

So, each graduate can receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the relationship between the number of small beans and the number of large beans. 

First, we know that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. This means that the number of small beans is 3 times the number of medium beans.

Since Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, the number of medium beans is 2 times the number of large beans. 

Let's denote the number of large beans as L. Then, the number of medium beans is 2L, and the number of small beans is 3 * 2L = 6L.

We are given that it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up. So, L = 75.

Now, we can find the number of small beans by substituting L = 75 into the equation for the number of small beans: 6L = 6 * 75 = 450.

The final answer is: 450"
"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total earnings and total expenses. 

Her total earnings are $15 per day for 3 days, so her total earnings are 15 * 3 = $45.

Her total expenses are $3 per day for 3 days, so her total expenses are 3 * 3 = $9.

Now, we subtract her total expenses from her total earnings to find out her net earnings: 45 - 9 = $36.

Since she spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, her total hours worked is 6 * 3 = 18 hours.

To find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her net earnings by her total hours worked: 36 / 18 = $2.

"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to first find out how many soda bottles he will place along the driveway. 

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the number of bottles, we divide the total width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since it takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we multiply the number of bottles by the time it takes to place each one:

8 bottles * 5 seconds per bottle = 40 seconds

So, it will take Richard 40 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many packs Uncle Franky can make, we first need to find out how many apples he has in total. Since he ordered two boxes and each box has 40 apples, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of apples in each box.

Total apples = 2 boxes * 40 apples/box = 80 apples

Now, we need to find out how many packs he can make with 80 apples. Since each pack has 8 apples, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each pack.

Number of packs = Total apples / apples per pack = 80 / 8 = 10

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples.

"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought. 

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 * $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 * $6 = $18.
The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Since Amor starts with $50, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount of money: $50 - $40 = $10.

So, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost due to loans and not working while in college. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of loans he took: 
4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money he lost by not working while in college. 
He earned $25,000 per year before college, so in 4 years, he would have earned:
4 years * $25,000/year = $100,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he lost:
$200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000

After graduating, his income triples, so he now earns $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year.

To find out how long it will take him to earn the money he lost, we can divide the total amount of money he lost by his new income:
$300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years

So, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"To find the total area of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the two pieces of fabric. 

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, we add 2 feet to both the length and the width of the bed.

New length = 6 + 2 = 8 feet
New width = 8 + 2 = 10 feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the new dimensions by 2 to get the total area of fabric needed.

Total length = 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Total width = 10 * 2 = 20 feet

Now, we multiply the total length and total width to get the total area of fabric needed.

Total area = Total length * Total width = 16 * 20 = 320 square feet

"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then add them together.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 
So, they delivered 204 + 5 = 209 letters on Wednesday.

Now, let's add the number of letters delivered each day: 
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736

"To find the average loss, we need to calculate the total loss and then divide it by the number of races. 

First, let's find the amount Johnny's dad lost in the first race, which is $5.

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, the amount he won in the second race is 2 * $5 + $1 = $11.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, the amount he lost in the third race is 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

Now, let's calculate the total loss. The total loss is the sum of the loss in the first race and the loss in the third race, minus the win in the second race. Total loss = $5 - $11 + $16.50 = $10.50.

The number of races is 3. 

To find the average loss, we divide the total loss by the number of races. Average loss = $10.50 / 3 = $3.50.

"Let's denote the share of the first person as x. 

Since the second person took $80 more than the first, the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Combine like terms: x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920.

Combine like terms again: 4x + 240 = 1920.

Subtract 240 from both sides: 4x = 1680.

Divide both sides by 4: x = 420.

The share of the first person is $420.

"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we first need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks have 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since the painters worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to find out how many hours that is. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days to get the total hours worked: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4 to get the hours worked by each painter: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms again:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

Number of balls in the first set = x + 4
= 6 + 4

The car was bought in 2007 for $20,000. 

The price of the car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. 

First, we'll calculate the price of the car in 2008:
Price in 2008 = 20,000 - (20,000 * 0.21) = 20,000 - 4,200 = $15,800

Next, we'll calculate the price of the car in 2009:
Price in 2009 = 15,800 - (15,800 * 0.21) = 15,800 - 3,318 = $12,482

Finally, we'll calculate the price of the car in 2010:
Price in 2010 = 12,482 - (12,482 * 0.21) = 12,482 - 2,623.22 = $9,858.78

The price of the car in the year 2010 is $9,858.78."

"To find the total cost of renovating your kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and then multiply it by the cost of each tile.

First, let's find the area of a single tile. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1 ft, the area of a single tile is 1 ft * 1 ft = 1 SqFt.

Now, to find the total number of tiles required, we divide the total area of the kitchen floor by the area of a single tile:

Total area of kitchen floor = 200 SqFt
Area of a single tile = 1 SqFt
Total number of tiles = Total area of kitchen floor / Area of a single tile
Total number of tiles = 200 / 1
Total number of tiles = 200

Now, we multiply the total number of tiles by the cost of each tile to find the total cost:

Total number of tiles = 200
Cost of each tile = $12
Total cost = Total number of tiles * Cost of each tile
Total cost = 200 * 12
Total cost = $2400

"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a week, we need to calculate the total number of twin and king size sheets he puts on the beds and then divide that by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. Since each twin bed requires 1 set of sheets and the king size bed requires 1 set of sheets, the total number of sets of sheets he puts on the beds is 4 (twin) + 1 (king) = 5 sets.

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 1, which is 2. This means that Greg can wash 2 twin sets of sheets and 1 king set of sheets in 2 loads.

Now, let's calculate the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a week. Since he has 5 sets of sheets to wash and he can wash 3 sets (2 twin + 1 king) in 2 loads, he will need 5 / 3 = 1.67 loads. However, since we can't have a fraction of a load, we round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, we round up to 2 loads because Greg can't wash 2/3 of a load. However, since he can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set in 2 loads, he will need 2 loads for the first 4 sets of sheets and 1 more load for the last set of sheets. So, he will need 3 loads for the week.

To find the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we multiply the number of loads he does in a week by the number of weeks in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year is 3 * 52 = 156.

The final answer is: 156"
"To find the total number of movies Jill and her friends watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of movies they watch in one weekend and then multiply it by 4.

They watch 4 movies on Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in one weekend, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

To find the total number of movies they watch in 4 weeks, we multiply the number of movies they watch in one weekend by 4: 6 * 4 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how many stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to calculate the total number of stickers he collected over the past three years.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. 
Last year, he collected 50 stickers. So, he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.
This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.
Now, we add the stickers from the previous year and this year to the initial number of stickers: 150 + 100 = 250 stickers.

The total number of stickers Leo has in his collection is 250."
"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount of cat food each cat eats per day (60 grams).

First, we need to calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's 3 cats eat per day. Since each cat eats 60 grams of food twice a day, we multiply 60 grams by 2 to get the daily consumption per cat, which is 120 grams. Then, we multiply this by the number of cats, which is 3.

Daily consumption per cat: 60 grams * 2 = 120 grams
Total daily consumption for 3 cats: 120 grams * 3 = 360 grams

Now, we divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the total daily consumption (360 grams) to find out how many days it will last.

720 grams / 360 grams = 2

So, the cat food will last for 2 days."
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

We know that Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake did, Jake must have eaten 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

We also know that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake did. Since Jake ate 7 slices, Silvia must have eaten 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

To find the total number of slices eaten, we need to add the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia. 

Total slices eaten = 10 (Becky) + 7 (Jake) + 14 (Silvia) = 31

31"
"Let's denote the time Donovan took as 'x'. Since Betsy took 18 minutes longer than Donovan, the time Betsy took is 'x + 18'. 

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of the time taken by both Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. So, we can write the equation as x + (x + 18) = 98.

Combine like terms: 2x + 18 = 98.

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

Since x is the time Donovan took, and Betsy took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's time is x + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58.

The final answer is: 58"
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of the cast, the visit, the painkillers, and the parking separately and then add them together.

The cost of the cast is $200.

The cost of the visit is $300/hour for 0.5 hours (since it's a 30-minute visit). So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.

The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill for 30 pills. So, the cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

The cost of parking is $6/hour for 2 hours. So, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add all these costs together to get the total cost of the doctor's visit.

Total cost = cost of cast + cost of visit + cost of painkillers + cost of parking
Total cost = $200 + $150 + $120 + $12
Total cost = $482

The final answer is: $482"
"To find out how many emails James responds to, we first need to find out how many emails he doesn't respond to. 

20% of 80 emails is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails. 

So, James doesn't respond to 16 emails. 

The rest of the emails he responds to is 80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Since James works 5 days a week, we need to multiply the number of emails he responds to in a day by 5. 

64 * 5 = 320 emails.

The final answer is: 320"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we need to calculate the number of classes that visited each day and then add them up.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the number of classes that visited each day:
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 207

The final answer is: 207"
"To find the average score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the number of tests. 

First, let's add up the scores of the first 3 tests: 100 + 100 + 100 = 300. 

Then, we add the score of the 4th test: 300 + 80 = 380.

Now, we divide the total score by the number of tests: 380 / 4 = 95.

The final answer is: 95"
"To find the total number of pizzas left, we first need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 
70% of 20 is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 
They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

The total number of pizzas eaten is 14 (by the glee club) + 32 (by the football team) = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered is 20 (by the glee club) + 40 (by the football team) = 60 pizzas.

The number of pizzas left is the total number of pizzas ordered minus the total number of pizzas eaten, which is 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of big coupons. Since Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and he's sending out 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is 2 * 700 = 1400.

Now, let's calculate the cost of mailing small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, and there are 700 small coupons, so the total cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 = 3500 cents.

Next, let's calculate the cost of mailing big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, and there are 1400 big coupons, so the total cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 = 21000 cents.

Now, we add the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons together to find the total cost of postage. 3500 + 21000 = 23500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100. 23500 / 100 = 235 dollars.

The final answer is: $235"
"To find out how many meatballs were in the sub sandwiches that remained, we first need to determine how many meatballs Sidney initially ordered. 

Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, so Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches. 

Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, so Sidney initially had 7 * 4 = 28 meatballs.

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, so Sidney had 7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches left.

Sidney then ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, so he had 3 + 3 = 6 meatball sub sandwiches.

Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, so the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we first need to find out how many trucks were still operational after the mechanical failures. 

Mr Hezekiah had 20 trucks dispatched, and a quarter of them had mechanical failures. A quarter of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5. 

So, 20 - 5 = 15 trucks were still operational.

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 * 20 = 300 tons.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total cost of the butter, we first need to determine how much Dennis needs to buy. Since he needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

Since the grocery store has a promotion for buy one pound of butter get one half off, we can calculate the cost as follows:

- For the first pound of butter, the cost is $4.00.
- For the second pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).
- For the third pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).
- For the fourth pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).
- For the fifth pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).
- For the sixth pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).

The total cost of the butter is $4.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 = $12.00.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find the total cost of the party, we need to calculate the number of additional guests beyond the initial 20 and then multiply that by the cost per additional guest. 

First, let's find the total number of guests: 
Kayla invited 25 classmates + 7 dance class girls + 13 family members = 45 guests. 
However, 4 people said they could not come, so the total number of guests is 45 - 4 = 41.

Since the initial 20 guests are included in the rental fee, we need to find the number of additional guests: 
41 total guests - 20 initial guests = 21 additional guests.

Now, we can calculate the cost for the additional guests: 
21 additional guests * $6 per guest = $126.

Adding the initial rental fee to the cost for the additional guests, we get: 
$125 (rental fee) + $126 (additional guests) = $251.

The final answer is: $251"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has 3/4 of her money left. Since she had $60, we can set up the equation:

3/4 * x = 60

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 4/3:

x = 60 * (4/3)
x = 80

So Maggie had $80 initially.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she has 2/3 of her money left. Since she also had $60, we can set up the equation:

2/3 * y = 60

To solve for y, we multiply both sides by 3/2:

y = 60 * (3/2)
y = 90

So Riza had $90 initially.

Now, let's find out how much money they have left in total:

Maggie has 3/4 of $80, which is 3/4 * 80 = 60 dollars.
Riza has 2/3 of $90, which is 2/3 * 90 = 60 dollars.

The total amount of money they have left is 60 + 60 = 120 dollars.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to determine how many bananas the second monkey eats. 

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Since there are three monkeys in total, and they eat all the bananas in a day, we can set up an equation to find the total number of bananas eaten by the three monkeys in a day. Let's denote the number of bananas the third monkey eats as x. The total number of bananas eaten by the three monkeys is 10 (first monkey) + 14 (second monkey) + x (third monkey).

We know that the total number of bananas is 315, and it's enough for a week, which is 7 days. So, the total number of bananas eaten by the three monkeys in a week is 315. 

However, we are asked to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, not in a week. To find the daily consumption, we need to divide the total number of bananas by 7. 

The total number of bananas eaten by the three monkeys in a day is 315 / 7 = 45.

Now, we can set up an equation to find the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day: 10 (first monkey) + 14 (second monkey) + x (third monkey) = 45.

Solving for x, we get: x = 45 - 10 - 14 = 21.

"To find out how many puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he placed. 

Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which is 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. 

Then, he finished another 500 piece puzzle, which is 500 pieces. 

So, the total number of pieces he placed is 250 + 500 = 750 pieces.

The final answer is: 750"
"To find out how much Jenny paid for the roses, we need to determine if she bought the roses by the dozen or individually. Since she bought 15 roses, it's more likely that she bought them individually because 15 is not a multiple of 12.

The cost of 15 roses at $2 each is 15 * $2 = $30.

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25.

Since she spent $30 and had $25, she needs to pay the difference, which is $30 - $25 = $5.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to find out how many quarters make up $5. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 5 = 20 quarters in $5.

Jenny leaves with 20 quarters.

"To find out how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time interval between the first train's arrival and the fourth train's arrival.

The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the train Paul will board.

Since Paul is at the station when the first train arrives, he will wait for 145 - 10 = 135 minutes for his train.

The final answer is: 135"
"To find out how many more weeks Melanie needs to save toothpicks, we first need to determine how many toothpicks she has saved so far. 

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week and has been doing so for 12 weeks. 

Number of toothpicks saved so far = 10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks in total, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs to save.

Number of toothpicks needed = 200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Melanie to save 80 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week.

Number of weeks needed = 80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we first need to find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price, so the price he paid is 75% of $2000, which is 0.75 * $2000 = $1500.

Then, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is 1.2 * $1500 = $1800.

To find the discount percentage, we need to find the difference between the original price and the price at which Mr. Rogers' friend bought the watch, and then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100.

The discount is ($2000 - $1800) = $200.

The percentage discount is ($200 / $2000) * 100 = 10%.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours and then multiply it by the rate at which the springs create jellyfish.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute. So, the total number of seconds in 4 hours is:

60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since each spring creates a new jellyfish every second, the total number of jellyfish created by one spring in 14400 seconds is 14400.

Now, if we have 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created in 14400 seconds is:

14400 * 5 = 72000

So, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

The final answer is: 72000"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score. Binkie's score is 90, so twice that would be 2 * 90 = 180.

Frankie's score is 15 better than twice Binkie's score, so we add 15 to 180. Frankie's score is 180 + 15 = 195.

The final answer is: 195"
"To find the total distance James walked, we need to calculate the round trip distance. Since he walked halfway to the store and then back home, the total distance is 2 * 4 miles = 8 miles.

Since James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula time = distance / speed to find the total time taken. 

time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours

However, this is the total time taken for the round trip. We need to find the time taken to reach the store initially. Since James walked halfway to the store and then back home, the time taken to reach the store initially is half of the total time.

Time taken to reach the store initially = 2 hours / 2 = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we first need to calculate the total cost of buying the bananas individually and then compare it to the cost of buying them in bunches.

If Jenny buys 10 bunches with 4 bananas per bunch, she buys a total of 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

The cost of buying 10 bunches is $3.00 per bunch, so the total cost is 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

So, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much fence each person gets. Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet of fence.

We know that the total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we need to first determine its growth rate per year. 

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so we divide 8 by 4 to get the growth rate per year. 

8 / 4 = 2 inches per year.

Now, we multiply the growth rate per year by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

First, let's find the number of each type of bike sold:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150
- BMX bikes: 300 * 0.15 = 45
- MTB bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:
- Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250 (since BMX is half the price of MTB, which is $500, so BMX is $500 / 2 = $250)
- MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add up the total earnings from all types of bikes:
$67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck, then subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

Now, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made: 30 - 18 = 12.

So, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field.

12"
"To find the total time John spends learning, we need to calculate the time spent in classes and the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday.

First, let's find the total time spent in classes. John takes 2 extra classes, each 40 minutes long, 5 days a week. 

Time spent in classes per day = 2 * 40 minutes = 80 minutes
Time spent in classes per week = 80 minutes * 5 days = 400 minutes

Now, let's find the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday. John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time. 

First, we need to find the total minutes in a week. There are 24 hours in a day, and 7 days in a week. 

Total minutes in a day = 24 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 1440 minutes
Total minutes in a week = 1440 minutes/day * 7 days = 10080 minutes

Now, we can find the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday.

Extra time per week = 1/16 * 10080 minutes = 630 minutes

Now, we can find the total time spent learning per week.

Total time spent learning per week = Time spent in classes per week + Extra time per week
Total time spent learning per week = 400 minutes + 630 minutes = 1030 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60.

Total time spent learning per week in hours = 1030 minutes / 60 = 17.17 hours

"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to first find the initial height from which it is dropped. Since the third floor is 24 feet high, the initial height is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

The ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height with each bounce. So, on the first bounce, it will reach a height of 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, it will reach a height of 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child step by step.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert the height of the first child to inches: 6 feet * 12 inches/foot = 72 inches.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the height of the second child is 72 inches + 2 inches = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the height of the third child is 74 inches - 5 inches = 69 inches.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the height of the fourth child is 69 inches + 3 inches = 72 inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples and the orchard sold 2000 apples, we can divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag.

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now that we know the orchard sold 200 bags, we can multiply the number of bags by the price per bag to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The final answer is: $1000"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

First, the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. Before that, the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left. So, the velociraptors ate half of (x - 270), where x is the total weight of the triceratops before the T-Rex ate. 

The equation becomes: (x - 270) / 2 = 270

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2: 
x - 270 = 540

Now, we add 270 to both sides: 
x = 810

So, the triceratops weighed 810 kilograms before the T-Rex ate.

The final answer is: 810"
"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted and then divide it by the coverage of a gallon of paint to find out how many gallons are needed. After that, we can multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon to get the total cost.

First, let's calculate the area of each wall:
- North wall: 10 x 8 = 80 square feet
- South wall: 10 x 8 = 80 square feet
- East wall: 5 x 8 = 40 square feet
- West wall: 5 x 8 = 40 square feet

Now, let's add up the areas of all the walls:
80 + 80 + 40 + 40 = 240 square feet

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need to divide the total area by 20 to find out how many gallons are needed:
240 / 20 = 12 gallons

Now, let's multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon to get the total cost:
12 gallons * $12 per gallon = $144

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to determine the probability of her choosing a shaken can out of the remaining cans.

Initially, there were 12 sodas. Ellen shook 3 of them, so 3 were shaken and 9 were unshaken. She took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas. Her brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken and 7 unshaken sodas.

The total number of sodas left is 2 (shaken) + 7 (unshaken) = 9.

The probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans: 2/9.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (2/9) * 100 = 22.22%.

The final answer is: 22.22"
"To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them: 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the total number of days Billy helps, we first need to find the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

However, Billy takes 20% of these days off. 20% of 50 is 0.2 * 50 = 10. So, he takes 10 days off.

The number of days he helps is 50 - 10 = 40.

Since Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

The total number of people he helps is 40 * 6 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of people inside the church, we first need to calculate the total number of people that were transported by the buses and the cars. 

The number of people transported by the buses is the number of buses multiplied by the number of people each bus can carry: 12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people.

The number of people transported by the cars is the number of cars multiplied by the number of people each car can carry: 20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people.

The total number of people transported is the sum of the people transported by the buses and the cars: 420 people + 60 people = 480 people.

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the total number of people transported from the total number of people present (which is not given). However, we can assume that the total number of people present is the sum of the people transported and the people inside the church. Let's denote the number of people inside the church as x.

The equation becomes: x + 480 = total number of people present.

However, we cannot find the total number of people present from the given information. Therefore, we can only express the number of people inside the church in terms of the total number of people present.

But, if we assume that the total number of people present is the sum of the people transported and the people inside the church, we can express the number of people inside the church as x = total number of people present - 480.

Since we cannot find the total number of people present, we cannot find the exact number of people inside the church."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha.
2. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike.
3. Mike is 24 years old.

Since Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can find Martha's age by subtracting 4 from Mike's age:
Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now that we know Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age by adding 10 to Martha's age:
Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how long it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of each slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes
For the second biggest slide: 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we need to find the difference in time between the two slides: 
5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 15-minute breaks per day. 

First, let's calculate the total break time: 2 breaks * 15 minutes per break = 30 minutes
Now, let's add the lunch time: 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes per day

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours: 60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Now, let's multiply the daily time by 5: 1 hour * 5 days = 5 hours

The total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks after 5 days is 5 hours."
"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can multiply 8 by 3.5 to find out how many miles Micah ran.

8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now that we know Micah ran 28 miles, we can subtract the total miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles run by all three to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

Total miles run by all three = 52 miles
Miles run by Amber = 8 miles
Miles run by Micah = 28 miles
Miles run by Ahito = Total miles - (Miles run by Amber + Miles run by Micah)
Miles run by Ahito = 52 - (8 + 28)
Miles run by Ahito = 52 - 36
Miles run by Ahito = 16 miles

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total amount she spent after returning the item and then add that to the initial charge minus the returned item.

First, let's calculate the amount Sheila got back after returning the item:
$85.00 (initial charge) - $15.00 (returned item) = $70.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan:
The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage:
$20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00
Now, subtract the discount from the original price:
$20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the set of towels:
The set of towels was 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage:
$30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00
Now, subtract the discount from the original price:
$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the amount Sheila got back after returning the item:
$70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 'x'.

A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue, so the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means x/15 = 6.

To find the total number of jellyfish, we can solve for x:

x/15 = 6
x = 6 * 15
x = 90

The final answer is: 90"
"To find Caroline's age, we need to first find Ben's age, and then multiply it by 3.

We know Chris is 4 years old. Since Ben is two times older than Chris, we can find Ben's age by multiplying Chris's age by 2.

Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben's age, we can find Caroline's age by multiplying Ben's age by 3.

Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate Lauren's total savings needed for retirement and then determine how many years she needs to work to achieve that goal.

First, let's calculate Lauren's annual expenses in retirement. Since she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, her annual expenses will be:

40% of $100,000 = 0.4 x $100,000 = $40,000

Since Lauren plans to live for 20 years in retirement, her total expenses will be:

$40,000 x 20 = $800,000

Now, let's calculate Lauren's annual savings. She saves 20% of her current annual salary, which is:

20% of $100,000 = 0.2 x $100,000 = $20,000

To calculate the total amount she needs to save for retirement, we can use the formula:

Total Savings = Total Expenses / (1 - (1 + r)^(-n))

where r is the annual savings rate (20% = 0.2) and n is the number of years she plans to work.

However, since we are given the annual savings, we can use the formula:

Total Savings = Annual Savings x Number of Years

We need to find the number of years, so we can rearrange the formula to solve for n:

n = Total Savings / Annual Savings

First, we need to calculate the total savings needed:

Total Savings = $800,000

Now, we can plug in the values:

n = $800,000 / $20,000
n = 40

However, this is the number of years she needs to work to save the total amount. Since she plans to live for 20 years in retirement, we need to subtract those years from the total number of years:

n = 40 - 20
n = 20

So, Lauren needs to work for 20 years to save enough for her retirement."
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to first divide the total length of the ribbon by 4 to get the length of each of the initial cuts. 

100 cm / 4 = 25 cm

Then, we need to divide the length of each initial cut by 5 to get the length of each final cut.

25 cm / 5 = 5 cm

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total population of the school, we need to use the information given about the boys. Since 40% of the school population is 240 boys, we can set up the equation:

40% of x = 240

To find x, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:

0.4x = 240

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

So, the total population of the school is 600 students.

Now, we know that 40% of the school population is boys, and the remaining 60% must be girls. We can find the number of girls by multiplying the total population by 0.6 (60% as a decimal):

Number of girls = 0.6 * 600
Number of girls = 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how much money your mom spent, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items before applying the coupon. 

The cost of the set of pots is $19, and the cost of the sack of garden soil is $26. 

Total cost = cost of pots + cost of soil
Total cost = $19 + $26
Total cost = $45

Now, we need to subtract the coupon value from the total cost to find out the final amount spent.

Final amount spent = Total cost - coupon value
Final amount spent = $45 - $7
Final amount spent = $38

"To find the average height of heels at the party, we need to first find the total height of all the heels and then divide it by the total number of women.

The total number of women is 6 (3 wearing 4 inch heels and 3 wearing 2 inch heels).

The total height of the heels for the women wearing 4 inch heels is 3 * 4 = 12 inches.
The total height of the heels for the women wearing 2 inch heels is 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

The average height of heels at the party is 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Since Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days, we can calculate her daily target by dividing the total miles by the number of days:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Soledad is planning to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is a total of 250 miles per day. To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we subtract her planned daily miles from her target daily miles:

310 miles per day - 250 miles per day = 60 miles per day

So, Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total amount the store will receive after selling all the balls, we need to calculate the total revenue from each color of balls and add them together.

The store has 3 red balls, and each red ball costs $9. So, the total revenue from red balls is 3 x $9 = $27.

The store has 11 blue balls, and each blue ball costs $5. So, the total revenue from blue balls is 11 x $5 = $55.

The store has 25 green balls, and each green ball costs $3. So, the total revenue from green balls is 25 x $3 = $75.

Now, let's add the revenues from all the balls together: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157.

The store will receive a total of $157 after selling all the balls.

"To find out how much James will have left, we first need to determine how much Pierre and Paul will take. 

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg. 

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

So, Pierre and Paul will take 3 + 4 = 7 kg in total.

Now, to find out how much James will have left, we subtract the total taken by Pierre and Paul from the initial amount: 12 - 7 = 5 kg.

"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he spent. He spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle, so the total amount spent is $5 + $19 = $24.

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Raymond had. He had $21 initially and spent $24, so the amount of money he has left is $21 - $24. However, since you can't have a negative amount of money, this means that Raymond doesn't have enough money to cover the expenses. 

In this case, we need to find the difference between the amount he spent and the amount he had. The difference is $24 - $21 = $3. This means Raymond is short $3.

However, the question asks for the amount of money Raymond has left, not the amount he is short. Since he can't afford the expenses, we can say that he has $0 left.

The final answer is: $0"
"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first determine how much Anna spent on the books. We know she had a budget of $16 and had $2 left, so she spent $16 - $2 = $14 on the books.

Since she bought 2 books and they cost the same amount of money, we can divide the total amount she spent ($14) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

Cost of each book = Total amount spent / Number of books
Cost of each book = $14 / 2
Cost of each book = $7

"To find out how long it will take the light to blink 459 times, we need to first find out how many times the light blinks per minute. 

We know that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. 

To find the number of blinks per minute, we divide the total number of blinks by the total number of minutes: 
255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take for the light to blink 459 times. We can do this by dividing the total number of blinks by the number of blinks per minute:
459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute = 9 minutes.

Therefore, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times.

"To find out how many miles Brian will walk in 7 days, we first need to determine how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we multiply 10 miles by 7 days.

10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we can set up an equation where Brian's distance is half of Sofie's distance. 

Let x be Brian's distance in 7 days. Then, x = 70 miles / 2

x = 35 miles

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers and then find out how many toys the fifth worker must produce to meet the remaining demand.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour:

2 workers * 6 toys/hour * 10 hours = 120 toys

Next, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour:

2 workers * 4 toys/hour * 10 hours = 80 toys

Now, let's add the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers:

120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys

The manufacturer still needs 20 toys to meet the order, so the total number of toys needed is 400. Since the first 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must produce the remaining toys to meet the demand.

Let's denote the number of toys produced by the fifth worker as x. We know that the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker is 400 - 200 = 200 toys.

Since the fifth worker works for 10 hours, we can set up the equation:

x toys/hour * 10 hours = 200 toys

To find the number of toys produced by the fifth worker per hour, we can divide both sides of the equation by 10:

x toys/hour = 200 toys / 10 hours
x toys/hour = 20 toys/hour

"To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we first need to find the weight of each of his dogs. 

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/4 to find the weight of Elijah's first dog: 60 * 1/4 = 15 pounds.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/2 to find the weight of Elijah's second dog: 60 * 1/2 = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of Elijah's two dogs to find the total weight of his dogs: 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

To find the total weight of all the dogs, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs: 60 + 45 = 105 pounds.

The final answer is: 105"
"To solve this problem, let's work backwards from the information given.

Kris had 7 stickers left after giving some to Rob. Kris had 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob, so Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers before giving any to Rob.

Luis gave the rest of the stickers to Kris, and Kris had 16 stickers. This means Luis had 16 + 7 = 23 stickers before giving any to Kris.

Luis used half of the stickers and gave the rest to Kris. This means Luis had 23 stickers and gave half of them to Kris. Half of 23 is 11.5, but since you can't give half a sticker, we'll assume Luis had an even number of stickers. Let's try 22 stickers. Half of 22 is 11, which is a whole number.

So, Luis had 22 stickers before giving any to Kris. 

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Luis had 22 stickers, so Seth must have given him 22 * 2 = 44 stickers.

The final answer is: 44"
"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to first find the total weight of the M&M's in ounces and then multiply it by the number of M&M's per ounce.

Since John buys 3 large bags weighing 10 ounces each, the total weight of the M&M's is 3 * 10 = 30 ounces.

Since an ounce of M&M's has 30 M&M's, the total number of M&M's is 30 ounces * 30 M&M's/ounce = 900 M&M's.

To find the number of small bags John can make, we need to divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag, which is 10.

Number of small bags = Total M&M's / M&M's per small bag = 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's/small bag = 90 small bags.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to first calculate half of the circumference of the earth. 

Half of the circumference of the earth is 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km.

Now, we need to divide the distance Alfie needs to fly (20,000 km) by the distance Alfie flies every day (400 km).

20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days

"To find the speed of the fastest car, we need to first find the speed of the 2nd fastest car. 

Given that the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, and the average car can go 120 miles per hour, we can calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car as follows:

Speed of 2nd fastest car = 5 * Speed of average car
= 5 * 120
= 600 miles per hour

Now, we know that the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we can calculate the speed of the fastest car as follows:

Speed of fastest car = 1.25 * Speed of 2nd fastest car
= 1.25 * 600
= 750 miles per hour

The final answer is: 750"
"To find Vince's current age, we first need to find Liam's age two years ago. Since Liam is 16 now, two years ago he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince, so we can set up the equation: 14 = 2 * Vince's age two years ago.

To find Vince's age two years ago, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: Vince's age two years ago = 14 / 2 = 7.

Since we want to find Vince's current age, we need to add 2 to his age two years ago: Vince's current age = 7 + 2 = 9.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so let's call this number A.
- Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's call the number of eggs Sarah painted S. Then, Camden painted S + 12 eggs.
- Since Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, we can write the equation: S + (S + 12) = 30
- Simplifying the equation, we get: 2S + 12 = 30
- Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get: 2S = 18
- Dividing both sides by 2, we get: S = 9
- Since Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.
- Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, the total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline is 56 - 30 = 26. 
- Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, each of them painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.
- The difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold is 21 - 13 = 8.

"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we first need to find the total number of boxes Nik will need. Since each box can hold 8 crayons and Nik has 200 crayons, we can divide 200 by 8 to find the number of boxes.

200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes

Since each box weighs 8 ounces and Nik has 25 boxes, we can multiply 8 by 25 to find the total weight of the boxes.

8 ounces per box * 25 boxes = 200 ounces

However, we also need to consider the weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce and Nik has 200 crayons, we can multiply 1 by 200 to find the total weight of the crayons.

1 ounce per crayon * 200 crayons = 200 ounces

Now, we need to add the weight of the boxes and the weight of the crayons to find the total weight.

200 ounces (boxes) + 200 ounces (crayons) = 400 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can divide 400 by 16 to find the total weight in pounds.

400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much John makes, we first need to determine how many logs he can make from the tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we calculate 80% of 80 feet.

80% of 80 feet = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet long, we divide the total length of the usable tree by the length of each log to find out how many logs he can make.

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

From each log, he cuts 5 planks. So, we multiply the number of logs by the number of planks per log.

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

He sells each plank for $1.2. To find the total amount he makes, we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to first find the salary of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is 1/2 of what her brother earns. So, her brother's salary is 2 times Valerie's salary, which is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary. The combined salary of Valerie and her brother is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000. So, their mother's salary is 2 * $15,000 = $30,000.

Now, we add up their salaries to find the total amount of money they all have together: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Grandma's speed on the beach and on the sidewalk. 

Let's assume Grandma's speed on the beach is x miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she spends 40 minutes on the beach. 

The time it takes to walk 2 miles on the beach is 2/x. The time it takes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is 1/(2x).

Since the total time spent on the beach is 40 minutes, we can set up the equation: 2/x = 40.

Solving for x, we get x = 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.

Now that we know Grandma's speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk, which is 2x = 2(1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute.

The time it takes to walk 2 miles on the beach is 2/(1/20) = 40 minutes. The time it takes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is 1/(1/10) = 10 minutes.

The total time it takes to complete the entire 3-mile walk is 40 + 10 = 50 minutes.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take Jane to save a total of $60, we first need to calculate how much she has saved so far. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved is 4 * 8 = $32.

Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60. This is 60 - 32 = $28.

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the amount she needs to save ($28) by the amount she saves per week ($4) to find out how many more weeks it will take her to reach her goal. 

28 / 4 = 7.

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add the number of blue birds in each group of trees.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24. 

So, initially, Bob had 60 - 24 = 36 marbles.

Now, if he loses 10 marbles, we need to subtract 10 from the initial number of marbles he had. 

36 - 10 = 26

Therefore, Bob will have 26 marbles.

The final answer is: 26"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature of the second bottle. 

Let's denote the temperature of the second bottle as x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle into his water bottle, the total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces. 

Since the temperature of the mixture is at least 40 degrees, we can set up the following equation:

(33 * 4 + x * 1) / 5 >= 40

Simplifying the equation:

132 + x >= 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x >= 68

So, the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of cows. Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 21 days in three weeks. 

Number of cows added in three weeks = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of cows = Initial number of cows + Number of cows added
Total number of cows = 50 + 420
Total number of cows = 470

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens. Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. 

Number of chickens added in three weeks = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
Total number of chickens = Initial number of chickens + Number of chickens added
Total number of chickens = 20 + 210
Total number of chickens = 230

Now, let's add the total number of cows and chickens to find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks.

Total number of animals = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens
Total number of animals = 470 + 230
Total number of animals = 700

The final answer is: 700"
"To find the cost of each single bagel, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels with the discount, and then divide that by the total number of bagels.

The cost of 4 packs of bagels without discount is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, the discount amount is 10% of $40.00, which is 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00.

The total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Each pack has 9 bagels, so 4 packs have 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

The cost of each single bagel is $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate, we first need to determine how many scoops 1 less than 3 scoops is. 3 scoops minus 1 is 2 scoops.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops, which is 3 less than 6 potatoes for 2 scoops. 6 minus 3 is 3 potatoes for 2 scoops.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. If 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, then 1.5 potatoes make 1 scoop. 

Now, we need to find out how many scoops Gomer ate. Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. 23 minus 5 is 18 scoops.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate. If 1 scoop is 1.5 potatoes, then 18 scoops is 18 * 1.5 potatoes. 18 * 1.5 is 27.

"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, and then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days is 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester increases his egg consumption to 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days is 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

Now, we add the total number of eggs from both periods: 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens: 240 eggs / 12 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to determine the total number of red jellybeans. We know there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans. 

So, the number of red jellybeans = 2 * 17 = 34.

We also know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can find the total number of green and red jellybeans by adding the number of green and red jellybeans.

Total green and red jellybeans = 17 (green) + 34 (red) = 51.

Now, we can find the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans.

Number of blue jellybeans = Total jellybeans - Total green and red jellybeans
= 60 - 51

"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the total number of lemons he collects in one year and then multiply it by 10.

First, let's find the total number of lemons he collects in one year. He has 5 trees and each tree gives him 6 lemons per year. 

Total lemons per year = Number of trees * Lemons per tree per year
Total lemons per year = 5 * 6
Total lemons per year = 30

Now, we multiply the total lemons per year by 10 to find the total lemons in a decade.

Total lemons in a decade = Total lemons per year * 10
Total lemons in a decade = 30 * 10
Total lemons in a decade = 300

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women on the bus initially. 

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84. We can represent the number of men as 5x and the number of women as 9x, where x is a common multiplier. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can write the equation: 5x + 9x = 84

Combine like terms: 14x = 84

Divide both sides by 14: x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the initial number of women on the bus: 9x = 9 * 6 = 54

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining is: 54 - 20 = 34

"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we need to first determine how many bouquets he sold. We know that each bouquet has 12 sunflowers and costs $8. 

Faraday earned $56 from the bouquet per day. To find out how many bouquets he sold per day, we divide the total earnings from bouquets by the cost of each bouquet: $56 / $8 = 7 bouquets per day.

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers sold from bouquets per day is 7 * 12 = 84 sunflowers.

Now, let's find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold per day from individual sales. We know that he earned $26 from sunflowers per day. Since each sunflower costs $2, the number of sunflowers sold per day is $26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers.

To find the total number of sunflowers sold per day, we add the number of sunflowers sold from individual sales and bouquets: 84 + 13 = 97 sunflowers per day.

Since Faraday sold sunflowers for 3 days, the total number of sunflowers sold is 97 * 3 = 291 sunflowers.

The final answer is: 291"
"To find out how much money Adam loses, we first need to determine how many rocks he can buy with his $100. 

Since each rock costs $5, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of each rock: 

$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Adam can buy 20 rocks. 

Now, let's calculate how much money he can make by selling 60% of his inventory. 

60% of 20 rocks is 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks.

Since he sells each rock for $7, the total amount of money he makes is: 

12 rocks * $7 = $84

However, Adam invested all his money in the rock stand, which is $100. To find out how much he loses, we subtract the money he made from the initial investment:

$100 - $84 = $16

Adam loses $16.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene. 

First, let's find the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene:

- Large-sized picture scenes: 45 / 5 = 9 days
- Medium-sized picture scenes: 36 / 6 = 6 days
- Small-sized picture scenes: 49 / 7 = 7 days

Now, we need to find the LCM of 9, 6, and 7. 

The prime factorization of 6 is 2 * 3.
The prime factorization of 7 is 7.
The prime factorization of 9 is 3 * 3.

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:
- The highest power of 2 is 2 (from 6).
- The highest power of 3 is 3 * 3 (from 9).
- The highest power of 7 is 7 (from 7).

So, the LCM is 2 * 3 * 3 * 7 = 42.

Therefore, it will take Lauren 42 days to complete all the picture scenes.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

1. Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, if we let x be the number of seashells Carlos collected, then Jim collected x + 5 seashells. We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, so we can set up the equation x + 5 = 27.

2. To find the number of seashells Carlos collected, we need to solve the equation x + 5 = 27. Subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation gives us x = 22.

3. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. If we let y be the number of seashells Carrey collected, then Carlos collected 2y seashells. We know that Carlos collected 22 seashells, so we can set up the equation 2y = 22.

4. To find the number of seashells Carrey collected, we need to solve the equation 2y = 22. Dividing both sides of the equation by 2 gives us y = 11.

5. Now that we know the number of seashells each person collected, we can find the total number of seashells they collected. Carlos collected 22 seashells, Jim collected 27 seashells, and Carrey collected 11 seashells. The total number of seashells is 22 + 27 + 11 = 60.

6. Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, we need to divide the total number of seashells by 3 to find out how many each person got. 60 / 3 = 20.

"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to first determine Carl's height. We know that Isabel is 7 feet tall and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel. 

Isabel's height = 7 feet
Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
Ned's height = 7 - 2
Ned's height = 5 feet

We also know that Carl is one foot taller than Ned. 

Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 + 1
Carl's height = 6 feet

Since Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, we can find the length of the cane by dividing Carl's height by 2.

Cane's length = Carl's height / 2
Cane's length = 6 / 2
Cane's length = 3 feet

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles required to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

Since each juice can cover 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand, to cover 100% of 1 person's daily energy demand, we need 100 / 20 = 5 bottles.

For 2300 people, we need 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, to find out how many more bottles it needs to produce, we subtract the number of bottles it can produce from the total number of bottles required:

11500 - 4200 = 7300

So, Hortex would need to produce 7300 more bottles of juices to be able to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

The final answer is: 7300"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how many babies are wearing purple and blue. Since Carla has 8 babies and 3/4 of them are wearing purple, we can calculate the number of purple babies as follows:

Number of purple babies = 8 * (3/4) = 6

Similarly, the number of blue babies is:

Number of blue babies = 8 * (1/4) = 2

Now, let's find out how many babies are wearing bows. We know that all the blue babies and 1/3 of the purple babies are wearing bows. So, the number of purple babies wearing bows is:

Number of purple babies wearing bows = 6 * (1/3) = 2

The total number of babies wearing bows is the sum of blue babies and purple babies wearing bows:

Total number of babies wearing bows = 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This can be calculated as the number of purple babies wearing bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows, multiplied by 100:

"To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the amount of money he earned from each sale and add them together.

First, Abraham sold half of his land for $50. Since he owns 80 square meters, half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. 

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Since he owns 80 square meters, 1/4 of that is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters. 

Now, let's calculate the total amount of land he has left. He sold 40 + 20 = 60 square meters. So, he has 80 - 60 = 20 square meters left.

He then sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, the amount of money he earned from selling the remaining land is 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, let's add up the amount of money he earned from each sale. He earned $50 from the first sale, $30 from the second sale, and $60 from the third sale.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. Since a dozen is 12, we can calculate the total number of eggs as 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs, Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by each person: 5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden in the yard, we subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To find the total amount John makes in a week, we first need to determine the number of apartments in each complex and the total number of collections he makes in a week.

The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so the total number of apartments in these two complexes is 2 * 200 = 400.

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, which means it is 160% of the other two combined (100% + 60% = 160%). To find the number of apartments in the last complex, we multiply the total number of apartments in the first two complexes by 1.6 (which is the same as 160% or 160/100).

Number of apartments in the last complex = 400 * 1.6 = 640

Total number of apartments in all three complexes = 400 + 640 = 1040

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections he makes in a week is 3 * 3 = 9.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment, so the total amount he makes in a week is the total number of collections multiplied by the number of apartments and the pay per collection.

"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree, we need to calculate the fruits produced each year and add them up.

- In the 5th year, the tree produces 50 fruits.
- In the 6th year, it produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- In the 7th year, it produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- In the 8th year, it produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. First, we need to find out how many fruits a 10-year-old tree produces. Since a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, it produces 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits. So, an 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.
- In the 9th year, the tree doesn't produce any fruits.
- In the 10th year, it produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, let's add up the fruits produced each year: 
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

The final answer is: 2350"
"To find out how much money Jack has now, we need to calculate the amount Sophia gave him and add it to his initial amount.

Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100. To find 1/5 of $100, we multiply $100 by 1/5.

1/5 * $100 = $20

Now, we add the amount Sophia gave Jack to his initial amount.

$100 (initial amount) + $20 (amount given by Sophia) = $120

So, Jack now has $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R. 

We are given that R = 4B and B = Y - 7. 

We also know that R + B + Y = 37.

Substituting R = 4B into the equation R + B + Y = 37, we get 4B + B + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5B + Y = 37.

Substituting B = Y - 7 into the equation 5B + Y = 37, we get 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37.

Expanding the equation 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37, we get 5Y - 35 + Y = 37.

Combining like terms in the equation 5Y - 35 + Y = 37, we get 6Y - 35 = 37.

Adding 35 to both sides of the equation 6Y - 35 = 37, we get 6Y = 72.

Dividing both sides of the equation 6Y = 72 by 6, we get Y = 12.

Now that we know Y = 12, we can find B by substituting Y into the equation B = Y - 7. B = 12 - 7 = 5.

Now that we know B = 5, we can find R by substituting B into the equation R = 4B. R = 4 * 5 = 20.

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume Ronnie was given x dollars. Since Rissa was given thrice as much, Rissa was given 3x dollars.

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Ronnie is left with x - y dollars and Rissa is left with 3x - y dollars, where y is the amount they each gave to their little sister.

We are given that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

3x - y = (4/5)(3x)

To solve for y, we can multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction:

15x - 5y = 12x

Now, we can isolate y by subtracting 12x from both sides:

15x - 12x - 5y = 12x - 12x
3x - 5y = 0

Now, we can add 5y to both sides:

3x = 5y

Now, we can divide both sides by 5:

(3/5)x = y

Now, we can substitute this expression for y into the equation for Ronnie's remaining money:

x - y = x - (3/5)x
x - (3/5)x = (2/5)x

Now, we know that Ronnie was given $5, so we can substitute x = 5 into the equation:

(2/5)(5) = 2

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that there are four colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow. We also know that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint. 

Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as 'x'. Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, which is the sum of the red, white, purple, and yellow paint. We can write this as an equation:

x + x + x + 6 = 12

Combine like terms:

3x + 6 = 12

Subtract 6 from both sides:

3x = 6

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 2

Since 'x' represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, the amount of red paint used is also 2 pints.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, then add them together.

First, let's find the area of one bedroom: 
Area of one bedroom = length * width = 20 * 12 = 240 square feet

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms = 4 * 240 = 960 square feet

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area = 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas together: 
Total area = area of bedrooms + area of living room + area of the rest of the house
Total area = 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet

"To find the total number of clouds Alice counted, we need to calculate the number of clouds she saw each day and add them up.

On Monday, she saw 3 clouds.
On Tuesday, she saw double the number of clouds as Monday, which is 3 * 2 = 6 clouds.
On Wednesday, she saw double the number of clouds as Tuesday, which is 6 * 2 = 12 clouds.
On Thursday, she saw double the number of clouds as Wednesday, which is 12 * 2 = 24 clouds.
On Friday, she saw double the number of clouds as Thursday, which is 24 * 2 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add up the number of clouds she saw each day:
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

"To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run with the new box for $1, we first need to find out how many pods are in the new box. 

The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box. 20% of 100 is 0.2 * 100 = 20. So, the new box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, we know that the new box costs $12 and has 120 pods. To find out how many pods you can get for $1, we divide the total number of pods by the cost: 120 pods / $12 = 10 pods per dollar.

Since you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles for $1 with the new box. 

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. This means he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he is left with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which is 40 / 2 = 20 bills. So, he is left with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

Thomas then triples his money, which means he triples the number of bills. So, he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since each bill is now worth 5 dollars, the total amount of money he has is 60 * 5 = 300 dollars.

Since each bill is worth 5 dollars, the number of 5 dollar bills he has is 300 / 5 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals.

Now, let's find out how many goals team A scored in the second half. It's given that team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half. So, team A scores 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals in the second half.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team in the match. Team A scored 4 goals in the first half and 2 goals in the second half, so the total number of goals scored by team A is 4 + 2 = 6.

Team B scored 2 goals in the first half and 8 goals in the second half, so the total number of goals scored by team B is 2 + 8 = 10.

The total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by team A and team B, which is 6 + 10 = 16.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much chalk is left after Monday and then determine how many days it will last.

The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he uses 45% of it. 

45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

So, after Monday, the teacher has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk left.

Since the teacher will use 20% of the chalk each day, we need to find out how many days it will last.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. Then, the amount of chalk left after 'x' days will be 2.75 - 0.2x.

Since the teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we set up the inequality:

2.75 - 0.2x < 2

Solving for x, we get:

0.2x > 2.75 - 2
0.2x > 0.75
x > 0.75 / 0.2
x > 3.75

Since x must be a whole number (you can't have a fraction of a day), the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after 4 days.

"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to find the number of students on varsity. 

One-third of the girls are on varsity, so the number of girls on varsity is 12 * (1/3) = 4. 

One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so the number of boys on varsity is 12 * (1/4) = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

Since there are 24 students in total (12 boys and 12 girls), the number of students not on varsity is 24 - 7 = 17.

"To find the total cost of the milk, we first need to calculate the total amount Mr. Marcellus paid for the milk. 

Total gallons of milk = 4000
Cost per gallon = $3.5
Total cost = Total gallons of milk * Cost per gallon
Total cost = 4000 * 3.5
Total cost = 14000

Since 2/5 of the milk was expired, we need to find the amount of expired milk. 

Amount of expired milk = (2/5) * Total gallons of milk
Amount of expired milk = (2/5) * 4000
Amount of expired milk = 1600

The company will refund the cost of the expired milk. 

Refund = Amount of expired milk * Cost per gallon
Refund = 1600 * 3.5

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Colin's current age as C and Wendy's current age as W.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:
20 = C

Since he can buy 100 books for $500, we can find the total number of books he can buy by dividing the total amount he has ($27000) by the cost of 100 books ($500).

Total number of books = $27000 / $500 = 54

Now, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books he can buy per school.

Books per school = Total number of books / Number of schools

"To find out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza is needed for. 

For the cheese pizza, each friend eats 6 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of cheese pizza slices needed is 6 friends * 6 slices = 36 slices. 

For the pepperoni pizza, each friend eats 4 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices needed is 6 friends * 4 slices = 24 slices.

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to find out how many whole pizzas of each type Kate needs to buy. 

For the cheese pizza, we need 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas. 

For the pepperoni pizza, we need 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas.

Since Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, she needs a total of 3 + 3 = 6 pizzas.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many snowballs Jay builds and how many melt in a given time period. 

First, let's calculate how many snowballs Jay builds in 15 minutes. Since he can build 20 snowballs in an hour, we need to find out how many he builds in 15 minutes. 

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in 15 minutes, Jay builds (20 snowballs / 60 minutes) * 15 minutes = 5 snowballs.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. So, the net number of snowballs Jay has after 15 minutes is 5 - 2 = 3 snowballs.

Now, let's find out how many 15-minute intervals it will take to reach 60 snowballs. We can do this by dividing 60 by the net number of snowballs Jay has after each 15-minute interval, which is 3.

60 / 3 = 20 intervals of 15 minutes.

Since each interval is 15 minutes, we multiply the number of intervals by 15 to find the total time.

20 intervals * 15 minutes = 300 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60.

300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The remaining bandages after the second day are (x - 38 + 50) - 28.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. The remaining bandages after the third day are ((x - 38 + 50) - 28) + 100 - 25.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation:

(x - 38 + 50) - 28 + 100 - 25 = 78

Simplifying the equation:

x - 38 + 50 - 28 + 100 - 25 = 78

"To find the total amount John spent, we first need to determine the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. So, the cost per bottle of scotch is $600 / 10 = $60.

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of each bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost of scotch. 50% of $60 is $30, so the cost of each bottle of cognac is $60 + $30 = $90.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. He also planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which means he planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it a total of 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day. Since he planted 40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day, 1/4 of that is 40 * 1/4 = 10. So, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

To find the total number of trees planted in the two days, we need to add the number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees planted on both days. 

Total White Oak trees = 20 (first day) + 10 (second day) = 30
Total Lodgepole Pine trees = 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90

Now, we need to find the number of fish that do not have red stripes. Since 22 fish have red stripes, the remaining fish are 66 - 22 = 44.

Now, we need to find 5/11 of the remaining fish that have blue stripes. 

5/11 of 44 is (5/11) * 44 = 20.

So, the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is 22 + 20 = 42.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Amy had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 x 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors from the palettes.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 eyeshadow colors each, so she had 3 x 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister stole one of the palettes, which means Amy lost 4 eyeshadow colors (since each palette has 4 colors).

Now, Amy has 26 - 4 = 22 eyeshadow colors left.

Amy then uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set has 6 eyeshadow colors, half of that is 6 / 2 = 3 eyeshadow colors.

So, Amy uses up 3 eyeshadow colors from the makeup set.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

The final answer is: 19"
"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know Mattison's height is 60 inches. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is, so the total height of the two-story house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

Since the first floor's floor to ceiling height is thrice as high as Mattison's height, the first floor's height is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Now, to find the height of the second floor, we subtract the first floor's height from the total height of the two-story house: 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is the same as the height of the first floor, which is 180 inches.

The final answer is: 180"
"To find the number of shells found by team Alphas, we need to calculate 40% of 700. 

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells remaining after team Alphas found their share. 

Remaining shells = Total shells - Shells found by Alphas
= 700 - 280
= 420 shells.

Next, we need to find the number of shells found by team The finders, which is 60% of the remaining shells.

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells found by team Gogetters. 

Shells found by Gogetters = Total shells - (Shells found by Alphas + Shells found by The finders)
= 700 - (280 + 252)
= 700 - 532
= 168 shells.

The final answer is: 168"
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we first need to calculate the total miles all the dogs need to walk in a day. Since there are 4 dogs and they need to walk an average of 3 miles per day, the total miles they need to walk is 4 * 3 = 12 miles.

Now, we know the first dog needs to walk 1 mile, the second needs to walk 4 miles, and the third needs to walk 3 miles. So, the total miles walked by the first three dogs is 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles all dogs need to walk. So, 12 - 8 = 4 miles.

The last dog needs to walk 4 miles."
"To find out how much money John got from the loan, we need to calculate 40% of the value of his house. 

40% of $250,000 = 0.4 * $250,000 = $100,000

Now, John uses 60% of this amount to pay off his debts. 

60% of $100,000 = 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000

This means John paid off $60,000 of his debt. To find out how much money he has leftover, we subtract this amount from the loan amount.

$100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

So, John has $40,000 leftover after paying off his debt.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To find the total weight of the tunas caught, we need to add the weights of all three tunas. 

Weight of the first tuna = 56 kilograms
Weight of the second tuna = 46 kilograms
Weight of the last tuna = 26 kilograms

Total weight of the tunas = 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we can multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Total weight of the tunas * Cost per kilogram
Total earnings = 128 * 0.50
Total earnings = 64

The final answer is: $64"
"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first find the selling price of the magazines. 

The cost price of the magazines is $72. 

Trinity sells the magazines at 11/8 of the price she bought them. To find the selling price, we multiply the cost price by 11/8.

Selling price = Cost price * (11/8)
Selling price = $72 * (11/8)
Selling price = $72 * 1.375
Selling price = $99

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price.

Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = $99 - $72
Profit = $27

The final answer is: $27"
"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed by each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed by the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed by the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total amount of water removed by the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, we add the total amount of water removed by each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The final answer is: 29"
"To find out how many balloons were thrown, we need to first find the total number of balloons Jolene and her friends had initially. 

They filled up 10 packs of balloons with 30 balloons per pack. So, the total number of balloons is 10 packs * 30 balloons/pack = 300 balloons.

Since 12 balloons were left by the end of the afternoon, we subtract these from the total to find the number of balloons thrown. 

300 balloons - 12 balloons = 288 balloons.

The final answer is: 288"
"To find the total amount of the second medicine in one dose, we need to multiply 14 mL by 3. 

14 mL * 3 = 42 mL

So, the first medicine is 14 mL and the second medicine is 42 mL in one dose.

To find the total amount of each medicine in 8 doses, we multiply the amount of each medicine in one dose by 8.

For the first medicine: 14 mL * 8 = 112 mL
For the second medicine: 42 mL * 8 = 336 mL

The total amount of medicine in 8 doses is the sum of the first and second medicine. 

112 mL + 336 mL = 448 mL

The final answer is: 448"
"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we first need to find the capacity of John's school. 

Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we can find the capacity of one of John's classes by multiplying Ali's class capacity by 1/8.

Capacity of one of John's classes = 120 * (1/8) = 15

Since John has two classes, we multiply the capacity of one class by 2 to find the total capacity of John's school.

Capacity of John's school = 15 * 2 = 30

Now, we add the capacity of Ali's school (which is 120) to the capacity of John's school to find the combined capacity of both schools.

Combined capacity = 120 + 30 = 150

The final answer is: 150"
"To find the total amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we first need to calculate the total interest he owes his sister. 

The interest is 2% of the initial $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6. 

However, Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount he pays in the first 11 months is 25 * 11 = $275.

The remaining amount, including the interest, will be paid in the twelfth month. This remaining amount is the initial $300 (the amount he borrowed) plus the interest ($6), minus the total amount he paid in the first 11 months ($275). 

So, the amount he will pay in the twelfth month is 300 + 6 - 275 = $31.

The final answer is: $31"
"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we first need to determine the total number of diaper changes required for both children. Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and there are 2 children, the total number of diaper changes is 2 * 5 = 10.

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, we need to find out how many diapers she changes. Half of 10 is 5, so Jordan's wife changes 5 diapers per day.

To find out how many diapers Jordan changes, we subtract the number of diapers his wife changes from the total number of diaper changes. So, 10 - 5 = 5.

Therefore, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we first need to find the volume of the jar. The jar is a rectangular prism, so its volume is given by the formula V = length * width * height. 

Given that the base is a square with a side length of 6 inches and the height is 15 inches, the volume of the jar is:

V = 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, the actual volume of the jar that can be occupied by jelly beans is 0.8 * 540 = 432 cubic inches.

Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches. To find the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar, we divide the occupied volume by the volume of a single jelly bean:

Total jelly beans = 432 / 0.15 = 2880

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the number of red jelly beans is:

Number of red jelly beans = 0.3 * 2880 = 864

However, we are given that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find how far off Tim's guess was, we need to know his guess. Since we don't have his guess, we can't calculate the exact difference."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. 

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 of 40 is (3/4) * 40 = 30. So, 30 people entered the bus at the second stop. The total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the remaining spaces, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost of visits for the first 5 years and the cost of visits for the next 3 years.

For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit is $2. Since Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, the annual cost is 3 * $2 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 5 * $6 = $30.

The cost of one visit increased by 150% after 5 years. A 150% increase means the new cost is 2.5 times the original cost. So, the new cost of one visit is $2 * 2.5 = $5.

For the next 3 years, the annual cost is 3 * $5 = $15. For 3 years, the total cost is 3 * $15 = $45.

The total cost for all visits is the sum of the cost for the first 5 years and the cost for the next 3 years: $30 + $45 = $75.

"To find out how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to determine the total number of groups that will be formed and then multiply that by the time it takes for each group to try the escape room.

There are 4 grades (4-7) with 10 students in each grade, so the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40.

Since only the top 10 students in each grade get to try the escape room, we need to find the total number of students who will be trying the escape room. Since there are 4 grades, we need to find the top 10 students in each grade, so the total number of students trying the escape room is 4 * 10 = 40.

However, only 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students trying the escape room by the number of students per group: 40 / 8 = 5.

Since each group uses their full 45 minutes, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is the number of groups multiplied by the time per group: 5 * 45 = 225 minutes.

The final answer is: 225"
"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the tables and the total cost of the roof frames, then add them together.

The cost of the tables is 4 tables * $20 per table = $80.
The cost of the roof frames is 2 frames * $10 per frame = $20.

Now, we add the cost of the tables and the cost of the roof frames together: $80 + $20 = $100.

So, Ali has to pay John $100.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's say the length of the shorter piece is x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. So, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet. 

We can write an equation to represent this: x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms: 5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5: x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet, we can find the length of the longer piece by multiplying 8 by 4: 4x = 4(8) = 32

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound to find the total pounds of meat needed.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Now that we know Aiden needs 5 pounds of ground beef, we can find out how much seasoning he needs. He adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat.

Total pounds of meat needed = 5
Seasoning per pound = 2 tablespoons

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat needed * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2
Total seasoning needed = 10

Width of one window = 35 inches
Number of windows = 5

Total width of windows = Width of one window * Number of windows
Total width of windows = 35 * 5
Total width of windows = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the total width by 2.

Fabric needed = 2 * Total width of windows
Fabric needed = 2 * 175
Fabric needed = 350 inches

"Let's break down the information given. Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. If we let the number of cupcakes be 'c', then the number of brownies is 3c - 2.

Since each person gets 2 treats and there are 5 people in the class, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, so we can write the equation: c + (3c - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4c - 2 = 10.

Add 2 to both sides: 4c = 12.

Divide by 4: c = 3.

"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount. 

The original cost of both manicure and pedicure is $35 + $40 = $75. 

The 20% discount on $75 is 0.20 * $75 = $15. 

So, the discounted cost of both manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers in total (5 on each hand), the cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted cost of manicure and pedicure plus the cost of nail art, which is $60 + $30 = $90.

Initially, the price of the toy was $40.

In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we multiply the initial price by 1.8 (100% + 80% = 180%, or 1 + 0.8 = 1.8).

New price in December = $40 * 1.8 = $72

In January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we multiply the price in December by 0.5 (100% - 50% = 50%, or 1 - 0.5 = 0.5).

New price in January = $72 * 0.5 = $36

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the amount he earns from the standard lessons and the reduced-rate lessons separately and then add them together.

For the standard lessons, Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 per hour. So, the total amount he earns from standard lessons is:
4 * $80 = $320

For the reduced-rate lessons, Charlie has 2 lessons at a 25% discount. This means he charges 75% of his standard rate, which is 0.75 * $80 = $60 per hour. So, the total amount he earns from reduced-rate lessons is:

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many grapes were used by Madeline's brother and her mother, and then subtract that from the total number of grapes Madeline ate.

Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the total number of grapes used by her mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and her mother is 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

To find the initial number of grapes, we need to add the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and her mother to the grapes used by her mother to make the pies. However, since the grapes used by her mother are already included in the total, we only need to add the grapes used by Madeline and her brother. The initial number of grapes is 84 + 6 = 90.

"To solve this problem, let's first determine the capacity of each shelf. 

Let's denote the capacity of a middle shelf as 'x'. Since the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, its capacity is 2x. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so its capacity is 2x - 5.

We know that each of the middle shelves can hold 10 books. Therefore, x = 10.

Now, we can calculate the capacity of the bottom and top shelves:
- Bottom shelf: 2x = 2 * 10 = 20 books
- Top shelf: 2x - 5 = 2 * 10 - 5 = 15 books

The total capacity of the three shelves is 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, she needs more than one bookcase to hold all of them. Let's calculate how many bookcases she needs.

Let's assume she needs 'n' bookcases. The total capacity of 'n' bookcases is 55n.

We want to find the smallest 'n' such that 55n ≥ 110.

Dividing both sides by 55, we get n ≥ 2.

So, Elly needs at least 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find Rose's profit, we first need to calculate the total cost and total selling price of the eggs.

The cost of 5 dozens of eggs is $2.40 per dozen. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, 5 dozens will be 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

The total cost of 60 eggs is 5 * $2.40 = $12.

Now, let's find the total selling price. Rose will sell 3 eggs for $1. To find the selling price of 60 eggs, we need to divide 60 by 3 and multiply by $1. 

60 / 3 = 20, so 60 eggs will be sold for 20 * $1 = $20.

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total selling price.

Profit = Total Selling Price - Total Cost
Profit = $20 - $12
Profit = $8

The final answer is: $8"
"To find the number of white hats, we first need to find the total number of red and blue hats. 

Half of the hats are red, so the number of red hats is 100 * 0.5 = 50.

The remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50.

3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, so the number of blue hats is 50 * (3/5) = 30.

The number of white hats is the remaining hats after subtracting the red and blue hats, which is 50 - 30 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first calculate the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and there's a $3.00 discount. 

So, the discounted price of the bag is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we need to divide the discounted price by the number of sticks to find the cost of each stick.

Cost per stick = $15.00 / 30 sticks = $0.50 per stick.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100 (since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents).

Cost per stick in cents = $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to find out how many questions she needs to get right in total. 

First, let's find out how many questions she got right in the first test. Since she got 60% of 70 questions correct, we can calculate this as 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

Now, let's find out the total number of questions she needs to get right to pass. Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct, and there are 70 + 40 = 110 questions in total, we can calculate this as 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions.

Since she already got 42 questions right in the first test, she needs to get 77 - 42 = 35 questions right in the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B. We are given that B = 5S - 4. We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so S + B = 116.

We can substitute the expression for B into the second equation: S + (5S - 4) = 116. Combining like terms, we get 6S - 4 = 116. Adding 4 to both sides, we get 6S = 120. Dividing both sides by 6, we get S = 20.

Now that we know S, we can find B by substituting S into the equation B = 5S - 4: B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

The final answer is: 96"

"To find out how many marbles Brendan ended up with, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Brendan had 10 marbles.

He dropped half of them, so he had 10 / 2 = 5 marbles left.

Then, he found 3 more marbles, so now he had 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.

However, one of the marbles he picked up was a bead, not a marble, so he got rid of it. This means he had 8 - 1 = 7 marbles left.

Therefore, Brendan ended up with 7 marbles.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the family, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Next, let's calculate the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of 8 rooms is 4 rooms. So, 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, which is 4 * 4 = 16 small candles. The other 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each, which is 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles. 

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Now, we add the number of flashlights and the number of candles together. 4 flashlights + 36 candles = 40.

The final answer is: 40"

"To find the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to calculate the time for each side and add them up.

The first side takes 5 minutes. 
The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each.
The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all sides:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

The total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

"To find the total time it takes for the coat of varnish to dry on 6 paintings with the old varnish, we multiply the time it takes for one painting by the number of paintings. 

7 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 42 minutes

To find the total time it takes for the coat of varnish to dry on 6 paintings with the new varnish, we multiply the time it takes for one painting by the number of paintings.

12 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 72 minutes

Now, we subtract the time it takes for the old varnish to dry from the time it takes for the new varnish to dry.

72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes

So, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total time it takes for Phineas to cover the distance on land and in water. 

First, we need to find the distance Phineas needs to cover on land and in water. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, Phineas needs to cover 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

Time taken to cover the distance on land = Distance / Speed
Time taken to cover the distance on land = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

Time taken to cover the distance in water = Distance / Speed
Time taken to cover the distance in water = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Total time taken to return home = Time taken on land + Time taken in water
Total time taken to return home = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

"To find the total cost of the phone plan, we need to first determine the cost of the additional phones. 

Let's assume the cost of each additional phone is x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We know that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation 2x = 20 to find the cost of each additional phone.

Solving for x, we get x = 20 / 2 = 10.

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is 4x = 4 * 10 = 40.

The total cost of the phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones, which is 20 + 40 = 60.

"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in a day and then multiply it by the number of days in June.

Since Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day, and 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can calculate the total number of doughnuts he makes in a day as follows:

10 dozen * 12 doughnuts/dozen = 120 doughnuts/day

Since Derrick sells all the doughnuts, we can assume he sells 120 doughnuts every day.

Now, let's calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

To find out the total number of doughnuts Derrick sells in June, we multiply the number of doughnuts he sells in a day by the number of days in June:

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the total number of people he saw on the first three days and add it to the total number of people he saw on the remaining days.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the number of people on the second day is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day, so the number of people on the third day is 2 * 70 = 140.

The total number of people on the first three days is 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, the total number of people he saw on the remaining days is 60 * 4 = 240.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 260 + 240 = 500.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop. 

In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.

In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to four times the initial rate, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, which is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.

So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 2 minutes is 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels.

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop from the residual heat. This is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

The total number of kernels that popped is 200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

"To find out how many lemons Tim will need, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemonade he needs to make, including the extra gallon for Allen. 

Since Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade and 1 extra gallon, he will need to make a total of 5 gallons. 

Since 1 cup of lemon juice is required for 1 gallon of lemonade, and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the total amount of lemon juice needed. 

5 gallons * 1 cup/gallon = 5 cups of lemon juice

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the total number of lemons needed.

5 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 30 lemons

However, we also need to consider the extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart as the other gallons. This means it will require twice the amount of lemon juice. 

So, for the extra gallon, we need 2 cups of lemon juice. 

Total lemon juice needed for the extra gallon = 2 cups

Total lemon juice needed for the other 4 gallons = 5 cups

Total lemon juice needed = 2 cups + 5 cups = 7 cups

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the total number of lemons needed.

7 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 42 lemons

Therefore, Tim will need 42 lemons.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Elvis traveled in both directions and then find the difference between the two distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled west. Distance = Speed * Time. Since he traveled for 5 hours at 18mph, the distance traveled west is:

Distance west = 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled east. He traveled for 8 hours at 18mph, so the distance traveled east is:

Distance east = 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles

Since Elvis turned around and traveled east, the distance he is now from his house is the difference between the distance traveled east and the distance traveled west:

Distance from house = Distance east - Distance west
= 144 miles - 90 miles

However, John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. Therefore, the number of hot dogs he needs to buy is 40 - 4 = 36.

Since a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2, we need to find out how many packs John needs to buy. 

To do this, we divide the total number of hot dogs he needs to buy (36) by the number of hot dogs in a pack (6). 

36 / 6 = 6

So, John needs to buy 6 packs of hot dogs.

Since each pack costs $2, the total amount John needs to spend on hot dogs is 6 * 2 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how much money Frances has left, we need to calculate her total earnings and subtract her total expenses.

First, let's calculate her total earnings from selling cupcakes and cookies:

Earnings from cupcakes: 20 cupcakes * $2 = $40
Earnings from cookies: 40 cookies * $1 = $40
Total earnings: $40 + $40 = $80

Now, let's calculate her total expenses for buying the trays:

She buys 5 trays at $4 each, so her total expenses are: 5 * $4 = $20

Now, let's subtract her total expenses from her total earnings to find out how much money she has left:

Total earnings: $80
Total expenses: $20
Money left: $80 - $20 = $60

The final answer is: $60"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there are 5 children following the truck.

On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child, so the total number of children becomes 5 + 5 = 10.

On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children, so the total number of children becomes 10 + (10 * 2) = 10 + 20 = 30.

The original 5 children then give up and leave the group, so we subtract 5 from the total number of children: 30 - 5 = 25.

Therefore, there are 25 children now following the truck.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to calculate the total number of meals she has given out and subtract that from the total number of meals she has.

On Friday, she gave out 64 meals.
On Saturday, she gave out 30 meals.
On Sunday, she gave out 48 meals.

Total meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48 = 142 meals

Total meals Mamou has = 1,360 meals
Meals left to distribute = Total meals - Total meals given out
= 1,360 - 142
= 1,218

The final answer is: 1218"
"To find the total amount of money James has, we need to calculate the value of each coin and add them together.

A quarter is worth 25 cents.
Two nickels are worth 2 x 5 = 10 cents.

"To find the total age of all the siblings, we first need to determine the age of the older brother. Since one of the brothers is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother, the older brother's age is 12 * 2 = 24 years.

Now, we know that all the sisters are 16 years old. There are 3 sisters, so their total age is 16 * 3 = 48 years.

The total age of the brothers is 12 (younger brother) + 24 (older brother) = 36 years.

To find the total age of all the siblings, we add the total age of the brothers and the total age of the sisters: 36 (brothers) + 48 (sisters) = 84 years.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity separately and then add them together.

Meditation time per day: 15 minutes (morning) + 15 minutes (night) = 30 minutes
Since Charisma practices meditation every day, we multiply the daily meditation time by 7 (days in a week) and then by 4 (weeks):
30 minutes/day * 7 days/week = 210 minutes/week
210 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 840 minutes

Yoga time per week: 1 hour (60 minutes) * 5 days/week = 300 minutes/week
Since this is for 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly yoga time by 4:
300 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1200 minutes

Total time spent on meditation and yoga: 840 minutes (meditation) + 1200 minutes (yoga) = 2040 minutes

The final answer is: 2040"

"To find the total number of seeds, we first need to determine the number of seeds in a large sunflower. 

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, a small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5, which equals 18. 

Now, we add the 50% more seeds to the original 36 seeds: 36 + 18 = 54 seeds in a large sunflower.

To find the total number of seeds, we add the seeds from the small sunflower and the large sunflower: 36 + 54 = 90 seeds.

The total number of sunflower seeds is 90."
"To find out how many pens Sarah has, we first need to determine how many pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we can multiply 18 by 3 to find out how many pens Timothy has.

18 * 3 = 54

Now that we know Timothy has 54 pens, we can find out how many pens Sarah has. Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we can divide 54 by 2 to find out how many pens Sarah has.

54 / 2 = 27

So, Sarah has 27 pens.

"To find out how much money the company will receive for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks and then multiply it by the price per bar.

First, let's find out how many bars the company produces in a week. Since the company produces 5000 bars in a day, it will produce 5000 * 7 = 35000 bars in a week.

Now, we multiply the number of bars produced in a week by 2 to find the total number of bars produced in two weeks: 35000 * 2 = 70000 bars.

Since each bar is sold for $2, the total amount of money the company will receive for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks is: 70000 * 2 = $140000.

The final answer is: $140000"
"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, the total cost of the T-shirts would be 2 * $8 = $16. However, since there's a buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake only pays for one T-shirt at the original price and the other one at 50% off. So, the cost of the first T-shirt is $8 and the cost of the second T-shirt is $8 * 0.5 = $4. The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and Jake gets a 40% discount. The discount amount is $40 * 0.4 = $16. So, the cost of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store. The total cost is $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find out how much money Ryan has, we need to calculate his total earnings from doing chores and then subtract the cost of the ice cream cones.

Ryan earns $6 each week for 3 weeks, so his total earnings are 6 * 3 = $18.

He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each, so the total cost of ice cream cones is 4 * 1.25 = $5.

Now, let's subtract the cost of ice cream cones from his total earnings: 18 - 5 = $13.

The cost of a movie ticket is $6.50. To find out how many tickets Ryan can buy, we need to divide his remaining money by the cost of a ticket: 13 / 6.50 = 2.

So, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets.

"To find out how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days he works and then multiply it by the number of cars he services per day and his hourly wage.

Josh is open every day except Sunday and Wednesday, so he works 5 days a week. In 2 weeks, he works 5 days/week * 2 weeks = 10 days.

Since Josh services 3 cars a day, in 10 days, he services 3 cars/day * 10 days = 30 cars.

Josh gets paid $4 per car, so in 10 days, he makes 30 cars * $4/car = $120.

"To find out how many cookies Randy has now, we need to calculate the total number of cookies he had initially and then subtract the ones he ate or gave away, and add the ones he baked.

Initially, Randy had 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. 

Total cookies initially = 9 + 4 + 5 = 18

Randy ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. 
So, he ate 3 cookies in total.

Randy ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch.

Randy gave 2 sugar cookies to his friends.

Total cookies eaten or given away = 3 (snack) + 2 (lunch) + 2 (given away) = 7

Randy baked 4 of each flavor for dinner. 
So, he baked 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 cookies.

Total cookies added = 12

"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the amount he would get for the first half of the collection and the second half separately, and then add them together.

Since Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, we can divide them into two equal halves: 6 toy soldiers for the first half and 6 toy soldiers for the second half.

For the first half, Matthew would get $5 per toy, so the total amount for the first half would be 6 * $5 = $30.

For the second half, Matthew would get $7 per toy, so the total amount for the second half would be 6 * $7 = $42.

To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we add the amounts for the first and second halves together: $30 + $42 = $72.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many holes the dog digs in total and then subtract the holes filled by Nate from the total holes.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total holes dug by the dog is 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

Since the dog digs 6 new holes every night, we need to add these to the total holes. However, we don't know how many days Nate takes to fill the holes, so we can't directly calculate the number of nights. 

Let's assume it takes x days for Nate to fill the holes. In x days, Nate fills 9 * x holes. The total holes left after x days will be 84 - 9x.

However, the dog digs 6 new holes every night, so the total holes left after x days will be 84 - 9x + 6x = 84 - 3x.

We want to find the number of days it takes for Nate to fill all the holes, so we set the total holes left to 0: 84 - 3x = 0.

Solving for x, we get x = 84 / 3 = 28.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide 28 by 7 to find the number of weeks: 28 / 7 = 4.

"Let's break down the information given. We know that Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, but Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron. This means that if Aaron runs a certain distance in a certain time, Vanessa will run twice that distance in the same time.

Let's denote the time it takes Aaron to run 1 mile as 't'. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, the time it takes Vanessa to run 1 mile is 2t.

We are given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, and since he runs twice as fast as Vanessa, the distance he ran is half of the distance Vanessa ran. Vanessa ran 4 miles, so Aaron ran 4/2 = 2 miles.

Since Aaron runs 2 miles in 16 minutes, the time it takes him to run 1 mile is 16/2 = 8 minutes. This means that t = 8 minutes.

Now, we know that Vanessa runs 2t miles in the same time it takes Aaron to run 1 mile. Since t = 8 minutes, 2t = 2 * 8 = 16 minutes.

Therefore, Vanessa took 16 minutes to complete her part of the race.

Daily revenue = (6 reservations * 2 meals * $5) + (6 reservations * $5)
Daily revenue = (6 * 2 * $5) + (6 * $5)
Daily revenue = $60 + $30
Daily revenue = $90

Cost price of one watermelon = $80 / 50
Cost price of one watermelon = $1.60

Now, we need to find the selling price of each watermelon. The vendor sold the watermelons at a profit of 25%. To find the selling price, we add 25% of the cost price to the cost price.

Selling price of one watermelon = Cost price of one watermelon + (25% of Cost price of one watermelon)
Selling price of one watermelon = $1.60 + (0.25 * $1.60)

2. James is now twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. This means Dora's current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.
3. Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.
4. Given that James is 9 years younger than John, John's current age is 18 + 9 = 27 years.
5. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is 32 - 27 = 5 years old now.

"To find the total amount Mark paid, we first need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount and then add the labor cost.

The original cost of the radiator is $400. Mark gets it for 80% off, which means he pays 20% of the original cost. 

20% of $400 is 0.2 x $400 = $80.

So, Mark pays $80 for the radiator.

Next, we need to calculate the labor cost. The mechanic takes 3 hours at $50 an hour, so the labor cost is 3 x $50 = $150.

The total amount Mark paid is the cost of the radiator plus the labor cost: $80 + $150 = $230.

"Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation:

C + W = 20

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, so we can write the equation:

2C + 4W = 70

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by 2 to get:

2C + 2W = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to get:

2C + 4W - (2C + 2W) = 70 - 40
2W = 30

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

W = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of chickens:

C + 15 = 20
C = 5

So, there are 5 chickens on the farm.
