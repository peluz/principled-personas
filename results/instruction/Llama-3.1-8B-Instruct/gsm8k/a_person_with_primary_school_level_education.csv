"Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 and bakes 4, so she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. 

She has 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left. 

She sells 9 eggs for $2 each. So, she makes 9 x 2 = $18.

"To make a robe, we need 2 bolts of blue fiber. We need half of that much white fiber, so that's 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber. 

So, we need 2 bolts of blue fiber and 1 bolt of white fiber. 

2 + 1 = 3

"Let's break it down. Josh buys a house for $80,000 and puts in $50,000 in repairs. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. 

First, we need to find the new value of the house after the repairs. To do this, we need to find 150% of $50,000. 150% is the same as 1.5. So, 1.5 x $50,000 = $75,000. 

Now, we add the $75,000 to the original price of the house. $80,000 + $75,000 = $155,000.

Josh sold the house for $155,000. He bought it for $80,000 and put in $50,000 in repairs. So, he spent a total of $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the selling price. $155,000 - $130,000 = $25,000.

The final answer is: $25,000"
"James runs 3 sprints a day, and he does this 3 times a week. So, he runs 3 sprints * 3 times a week = 9 sprints a week. 

Each sprint is 60 meters, so 9 sprints * 60 meters = 540 meters. 

The answer is 540."
"Wendi gives 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. That's 15 + 25 = 40 cups. She has 20 chickens and each chicken gets 3 cups of feed. So, 20 chickens * 3 cups = 60 cups of feed in total. 

To find out how many cups she needs to give in the final meal, we need to subtract the cups she already gave from the total cups needed. 60 - 40 = 20 cups. 

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break it down. One glass costs $5, but the second glass costs 60% of $5. 60% of $5 is 0.6 x 5 = $3. 

So, the first glass costs $5 and the second glass costs $3. 

Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. We can group the glasses into pairs. There are 8 pairs of glasses. Each pair has one $5 glass and one $3 glass. 

The cost of one pair is $5 + $3 = $8. 

Since there are 8 pairs, the total cost is 8 x $8 = $64.

The total cost is $64."
"Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep. So, Charleston has 4 x 20 = 80 sheep.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, and Charleston has 80 sheep. So, Toulouse has 2 x 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together. 160 + 80 + 20 = 260.

"Carla is downloading a 200 GB file. She can download 2 GB/minute. 

First, Carla downloads 40% of the file. 40% of 200 GB is 80 GB. It takes her 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes to download 80 GB. 

Then, Windows forces a restart. This takes 20 minutes. 

After the restart, Carla has to download the whole file again. The whole file is 200 GB. It takes her 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes to download the whole file.

So, Carla downloads 80 GB in 40 minutes, then waits 20 minutes, and then downloads 200 GB in 100 minutes. The total time is 40 + 20 + 100 = 160 minutes.

The final answer is: 160"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time: 60 * 3 = 180 miles. 

Then, he turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move. 

Next, he drives for half an hour at 30 mph. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time: 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles. 

After that, he drives the remaining time of 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours at 80 mph. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time: 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles. 

Now, we add up all the distances: 180 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 315 miles. 

The distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours is 315 miles."
"Eliza works 40 hours at $10 per hour, so she earns 40 x 10 = 400 dollars. 

For the overtime, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime pay is 1.2 times her regular rate, so it's 1.2 x 10 = 12 dollars per hour. 

Her overtime earnings are 5 x 12 = 60 dollars. 

Her total earnings are 400 + 60 = 460 dollars.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads. 

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month. So, 3 x 60 = 180 downloads in the second month.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30%. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3. 180 x 0.3 = 54. 

Now, we subtract 54 from 180 to find the number of downloads in the third month. 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

Now, we add up the downloads from all three months. 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

The final answer is: 366"
"Let's break it down. 

First, we need to find out how much 3 dozen donuts cost. 1 dozen is 12, so 3 dozen is 3 x 12 = 36 donuts. The cost of 3 dozen donuts is $68. 

Next, we need to find out how much 2 dozen mini cupcakes cost. 2 dozen is 2 x 12 = 24 cupcakes. The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is $80.

Then, we need to find out how much 6 dozen mini cheesecakes cost. 6 dozen is 6 x 12 = 72 cheesecakes. The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is $55.

Now, we need to add all the costs together. 

36 donuts cost $68, so that's 68 dollars. 
24 cupcakes cost $80, so that's 80 dollars. 
72 cheesecakes cost $55, so that's 330 dollars.

Now, we add 68 + 80 + 330. 

68 + 80 = 148
148 + 330 = 478

The total cost is $478.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much money Carlos will make in a year from selling lemons. He gets 7 lemons a year and sells each for $1.5. So, he makes 7 x $1.5 = $10.5 a year from selling lemons.

Then, we need to subtract the cost of taking care of the tree, which is $3 a year. So, he makes $10.5 - $3 = $7.5 a year from the tree.

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for him to earn back the $90 he spent on planting the tree. To do this, we need to divide the cost of the tree by the money he makes each year. 

$90 / $7.5 = 12 years.

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money from the lemon tree.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. If we say she started with x vacuum cleaners, then she sold x/3 at the green house. 

Now, she has x - x/3 vacuum cleaners left. To simplify this, we can multiply x by 3 and then subtract x, which is the same as subtracting x/3. So, she has 3x - x = 2x vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, she has 2x - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Now, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. Half of 2x - 2 is (2x - 2)/2. To simplify this, we can divide 2x - 2 by 2, which is the same as subtracting 1 from x. So, she sold x - 1 vacuum cleaners at the orange house.

Now, she has 2x - 2 - (x - 1) vacuum cleaners left. To simplify this, we can subtract x - 1 from 2x - 2, which is the same as subtracting x from 2x and adding 1. So, she has x - 1 vacuum cleaners left.

We know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, x - 1 = 5. To find x, we can add 1 to both sides of the equation. x = 6.

"First, we need to find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. 20% of 20 is 4. So, 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance.

Now, we have 20 - 4 = 16 students left. 25% of 16 is 4. So, 4 students enrolled in jazz dance.

Now, we have 16 - 4 = 12 students left. These students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to divide 12 by 20 and multiply by 100.

12 / 20 = 0.6
0.6 * 100 = 60

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the profit, we need to know the cost of the items and the selling price after the market goes up. 

Let's say the cost of the jewelry is $5,000 and it goes up by 2.5%. The selling price will be 5,000 + (5,000 x 2.5%) = 5,000 + 125 = $5,125.

The cost of the electronic gadgets is $8,000 and it goes up by 1.2%. The selling price will be 8,000 + (8,000 x 1.2%) = 8,000 + 96 = $8,096.

To maximize profit, we need to choose the item with the higher selling price. The selling price of the jewelry is $5,125 and the selling price of the electronic gadgets is $8,096. So, the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets.

The profit will be the selling price minus the cost. The profit from the electronic gadgets is 8,096 - 8,000 = $96.

The final answer is: $96"

"First, we need to find out how much Jill gets paid in a year for teaching. She works 35 hours a week and gets paid $20 per hour. So, we multiply 35 hours by $20. 

35 * 20 = 700

Now, we need to find out how much Jill gets paid in a year for being a cheerleading coach. She works 15 hours a week and gets paid $30 per hour. So, we multiply 15 hours by $30.

15 * 30 = 450

Now, we need to add the money she gets from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary. 

700 + 450 = 1150

She works 50 weeks a year. To find her annual salary, we multiply her weekly salary by 50.

"To find out how many eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to know how many days are in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week. 

7 days in a week * 4 weeks = 28 days

Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning. So, in 28 days, she will eat 3 eggs * 28 days = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide 84 eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks.

84 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 7 dozens

"Let's break it down. Marissa already walked 4 miles in 1 hour and 2 miles in another hour. That's 6 miles in 2 hours. 

To find out how much time she has left, we need to know how much distance is left. She has to walk 12 miles in total and has already walked 6 miles. So, she has 12 - 6 = 6 miles left.

If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the whole 12 miles, and she has 2 hours already, she has 12 / 4 = 3 hours left to walk the remaining 6 miles.

To find out how fast she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles, we need to divide the distance by the time. So, 6 miles / 3 hours = 2 miles per hour.

"First, I need to find out how much water is in the orange drink. Two-thirds of 10 liters is 6.67 liters (I divide 10 by 3 and multiply by 2). 

Then, I need to find out how much water is in the pineapple drink. Three-fifths of 15 liters is 9 liters (I divide 15 by 5 and multiply by 3).

Now, I add the water from the orange drink and the pineapple drink. 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters.

But I spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so I need to subtract 1 liter from the orange drink. 6.67 - 1 = 5.67 liters.

Now, I add the water from the orange drink and the pineapple drink. 5.67 + 9 = 14.67 liters.

The total amount of liquid is 24 liters, so I need to find out how much of it is water. 14.67 is the water from the orange and pineapple drinks. I need to add the water from the other 13 liters of the orange drink. Two-thirds of 13 is 8.67 liters. 

Now, I add the water from the other 13 liters of the orange drink and the water from the orange and pineapple drinks. 8.67 + 14.67 = 23.34 liters.

The answer is 23.34."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is now 31. So, Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old now.

Raymond had a son at the age of 23. This means that when Raymond was 23, his son was just born. Now, Raymond is 25, so 25 - 23 = 2 years have passed since his son was born.

So, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

"To find out how many centimeters shorter the candle will be, we need to know how many hours it burns. 

The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. That's 4 hours.

"Let's figure this out. If Kyle bought the book for $19.50 and it's 25% off, that means he got 75% of the original price. 

To find the original price, we need to divide $19.50 by 0.75 (which is 75% as a decimal). 

$19.50 ÷ 0.75 = $26

The original price of the book was $26."
"Let's solve the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much money Marie spent on the chicken meal, milk, and apples. 

The chicken meal costs $12. 
5 packs of milk cost $3 each, so 5 x $3 = $15. 
4 apples cost $1.50 each, so 4 x $1.50 = $6. 

Now, let's add the costs together: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33. 

Marie paid a total of $50, and she spent $33 on the chicken meal, milk, and apples. So, she spent $50 - $33 = $17 on the boxes of pizza. 

Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so to find out how many boxes Marie ordered, we need to divide $17 by $8.50. 

$17 ÷ $8.50 = 2.

"Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts. Each pair costs $16.50. So, 3 pairs of shorts cost 3 x $16.50 = $49.50.

Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants. Each pair costs $22.50. So, 3 pairs of pants cost 3 x $22.50 = $67.50.

Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes. Each pair costs $42. So, 3 pairs of shoes cost 3 x $42 = $126.

Now, we add the cost of shorts, pants, and shoes together. $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

There are 60 days. So, she eats 1 serving per day for 60 days. That's 60 servings in total.

Each carton has 15 servings. To find out how many cartons she needs, we divide the total servings by the servings per carton. 60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons.

Each carton costs $4.00. She needs 4 cartons. So, she will spend 4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00.

"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to know where his second stop was. He stopped 15 miles before the end of the trip, and the trip was 60 miles long. 

So, if he stopped 15 miles before the end of the trip, that means he was at 60 - 15 = 45 miles when he made his second stop.

Now, we know he stopped at 20 miles for his first stop. To find out how many miles he traveled between his first and second stops, we need to subtract the first stop from the second stop. 

45 miles (second stop) - 20 miles (first stop) = 25 miles.

Divide both sides by 18: x = 9

Now we know Darrell's age is 7x = 7(9) = 63 and Allen's age is 11x = 11(9) = 99.

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109

The third friend says 25% more than 80, which is 80 + (25% of 80). 25% of 80 is 20, so the third friend says 80 + 20 = 100 jelly beans.

Now, we need to find the average of 80, 60, and 100. To do that, we add them up and divide by 3.

We know that the total number of coins is 110. So, the sum of silver and gold coins is 110. 

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms: 
2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides: 
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2: 
x = 40

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, she has 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins.

He has 195 - 160 = 35 dollars left. But he has 5 dollars left, so he must have spent 35 - 5 = 30 dollars on something else. But he didn't spend any money on anything else, so he must have used the 30 dollars to buy the video games. 

He spent 160 dollars on video games, but he only had 5 dollars left. So, he must have had 160 + 5 = 165 dollars before buying the video games. 

He had 165 dollars and he spent 160 dollars on video games. So, he must have had 165 - 160 = 5 dollars left after buying the video games. 

He had 195 dollars and he spent 30 dollars on something else. So, he must have had 195 - 30 = 165 dollars after selling the lego sets. 

He had 165 dollars after selling the lego sets and he had 5 dollars left after buying the video games. So, he must have had 165 - 5 = 160 dollars after selling the lego sets but before buying the video games. 

He had 160 dollars after selling the lego sets but before buying the video games. He spent 160 dollars on video games. So, he must have bought 8 video games. 

He had 160 dollars after selling the lego sets but before buying the video games. He spent 160 dollars on video games. So, he must have sold 160 / 15 = 10.67 lego sets. But he can't sell a fraction of a lego set, so he must have sold 10 lego sets.

"Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour. She can run at 4 times that speed, so she can run at 4 x 3 = 12 miles per hour. She can walk at half of her running speed, so she can walk at 12 / 2 = 6 miles per hour.

She spends one-third of the time running, so she runs for 2 hours. She spends two-thirds of the time walking, so she walks for 4 hours.

She runs 12 miles per hour for 2 hours, so she runs 12 x 2 = 24 miles. She walks 6 miles per hour for 4 hours, so she walks 6 x 4 = 24 miles.

Since Charlie can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax, he will need 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles. So, the cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and the wicks is 2 x $10.00 = $20.00.

Now, we need to know how much money Charlie will get from selling 20 candles. Each candle costs $2.00, so 20 candles will cost 20 x $2.00 = $40.00.

To find the net profit, we need to subtract the cost from the money Charlie gets from selling the candles. So, the net profit is $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

The final answer is: $20.00"
"Let's break it down step by step.

Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 2/5 of 5 is 2. So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, she wrote 7 x 2 = 14 articles on Wednesday.

Now, let's add up the number of articles she wrote in the three days: 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Each article takes 4 hours to write. So, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is 26 x 4 = 104 hours.

"Let's break it down. John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. 

To find out how many blue ties he bought, we divide the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie. 

200 / 40 = 5

So, John bought 5 blue ties. 

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. This means the red ties cost 1.5 times the cost of blue ties. 

1.5 * 40 = 60

So, each red tie costs $60.

To find out how much John spent on red ties, we multiply the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie. 

10 * 60 = 600

John spent $600 on red ties.

To find out the total amount John spent on ties, we add the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties. 

200 + 600 = 800

The final answer is: 800"
"To find out how many pieces Tracy got, we need to know how many inches are in 4 feet. There are 12 inches in 1 foot. So, 4 feet is 4 x 12 = 48 inches.

The answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of units in the building, we need to multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor. 

15 floors * 8 units per floor = 120 units

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total units to find the unoccupied units. 

1/4 of 120 units = 120 / 4 = 30 units

So, there are 30 unoccupied units in the building.

"Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. To find out how many eggs they produce in a week, we need to multiply the number of eggs per day by 7.

252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since Lloyd sells eggs for $2 per dozen, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs he sells in a week. There are 12 eggs in a dozen.

1764 eggs per week / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen to find out how much Lloyd makes per week.

147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

Uriah has 30 comic books. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound. So, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total. He has already removed 7.5 pounds by taking out the comic books. So, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we need to divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy. 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break it down. 

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The cost for truck tires is $60 each and for car tires is $40 each. 

So, the total revenue on Thursday is (6 x $60) + (4 x $40) = $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires. The cost for car tires is $40 each. 

So, the total revenue on Friday is (12 x $40) = $480.

We need to find out which day had higher revenue. Thursday's revenue is $520 and Friday's revenue is $480. Thursday's revenue is higher.

Now, we need to find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue. 

The difference in revenue is $520 - $480 = $40.

There are 25 oranges in total. 1 is bad, so we subtract that from 25. 25 - 1 = 24. 

20% of the oranges are unripe. 20% of 25 is 0.2 x 25 = 5. So, 5 oranges are unripe. We subtract those from the total. 24 - 5 = 19.

2 oranges are sour. We subtract those from the total. 19 - 2 = 17.

So, the rest of the oranges are good. The answer is 17.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Marcy gets $50,000 per year for the first 20 years. 

After 20 years, she gets 5% of the value of the pension per year. To find the value of the pension, we multiply the annual pension by the number of years she worked. 

Value of the pension = $50,000 * 20 = $1,000,000

Now, we need to find 5% of the value of the pension. 

5% of $1,000,000 = 0.05 * $1,000,000 = $50,000

So, after 20 years, Marcy gets $50,000 per year. 

Now, she works for 10 more years (30 - 20 = 10). 

The $50,000 she gets after 20 years is her new base. 

So, for the next 10 years, she gets 5% of $50,000 per year. 

5% of $50,000 = 0.05 * $50,000 = $2,500

Now, we add the $2,500 to the $50,000 to get her new annual pension.

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to know how many miles she can drive per gallon. We know that she used 4 gallons of gas to travel 100 miles. 

We can find out the miles per gallon by dividing the miles she traveled by the gallons of gas she used. 

Miles per gallon = Total miles / Total gallons used
Miles per gallon = 100 miles / 4 gallons
Miles per gallon = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know how many miles she can drive per gallon, we can find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank. 

Total miles on a full tank = Total gallons in the tank * Miles per gallon
Total miles on a full tank = 12 gallons * 25 miles per gallon

Now, we know that the total number of students is 200, and the number of boys is 80. So, the number of girls is 200 - 80 = 120.

Next, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. So, the number of girls in the girl scout is 2/3 * 120 = 80.

Now, we want to find the number of girls who are not in the girl scout. We know that the total number of girls is 120, and 80 of them are in the girl scout. So, the number of girls not in the girl scout is 120 - 80 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many hours James slept, we need to multiply 2/3 by the number of hours Harry slept. 

2/3 * 9 = 6

So James slept 6 hours. 

Now, we need to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James. 

9 - 6 = 3

The answer is 3."
"Let's figure this out. 

First, we know that the sauce made 32 ounces. But the sauce was made from cans of tomatoes, and each can is 16 ounces. So, we need to find out how many cans Freda used. 

To do that, we divide 32 by 16. 32 divided by 16 is 2. So, Freda used 2 cans of tomatoes.

Now, we know that each can has 3 tomatoes. So, to find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we multiply 2 cans by 3 tomatoes. 2 x 3 is 6.

So, Freda used 6 tomatoes.

"Let's break it down. There were 30 cars originally. 5 cars took an exit, so we subtract those from the total. 30 - 5 = 25 cars left. 

Now, we know that 20 cars drove through in the last 15 minutes. So, if 20 cars drove through in the last 15 minutes, that means the remaining cars drove through in the first 15 minutes. We already know there are 25 cars left, so the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes are 25 - 20 = 5 cars.

The final answer is: 5"
"Mary has 40 window ledges and each ledge has 2 potted plants. So, she has 40 * 2 = 80 potted plants.

She received 18 new potted plants, so now she has 80 + 18 = 98 potted plants.

She will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family, so she will give away 40 potted plants.

Now, she has 98 - 40 = 58 potted plants left.

The final answer is: 58"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times. 1/4 of 20 is 5. So the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

Now we know how many times each friend pressed the doorbell. We need to add them up to find the total number of doorbell rings. 

20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 70 (third friend) + 60 (fourth friend) = 175

The final answer is: 175"
"Let's count the pages Solo has to read. 

He has to read 4 pages from his Science textbook, 20 pages from his Social Studies textbook, 7 pages from his History textbook and 8 pages from his Geography textbook. 

4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages. 

Solo already read 15 pages on Monday. 

39 - 15 = 24 pages left to read. 

He has 4 more days to complete all his reading. 

24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day. 

The final answer is: 6"
"John drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner on weekdays. That's 3 glasses a day. There are 5 weekdays. So, he drinks 3 x 5 = 15 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, he drinks water with breakfast and lunch, but soda with dinner. So, he drinks 2 glasses of water on weekends.

There are 2 weekend days. So, he drinks 2 x 2 = 4 glasses of water on weekends.

In total, John drinks 15 + 4 = 19 glasses of water in a week.

"To find out how long it takes for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to know how many 3-mile parts the city is divided into. 

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

42 miles / 3 miles = 14 parts 

Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each part, we multiply the number of parts by the time it takes to cover each part.

14 parts * 10 minutes = 140 minutes

The final answer is: 140"
"Poppy places a quarter of the pieces, that's 1000 / 4 = 250 pieces. 

Now, there are 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left. 

Then, her mom places a third of the remaining pieces, that's 750 / 3 = 250 pieces. 

Now, there are 750 - 250 = 500 pieces left. 

The answer is: 500"
"Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir. That means if Amir eats 5 cookies, Cody eats 3 x 5 = 15 cookies. 

To find out how many cookies they eat together, we need to add the number of cookies Amir eats and the number of cookies Cody eats. 

5 (Amir's cookies) + 15 (Cody's cookies) = 20 cookies.

"To find the inner volume of one box, we need to subtract the thickness of the walls from the length, width, and height of the box. 

Length: 5 - 2 = 3 inches (because there are walls on both sides)
Width: 6 - 2 = 4 inches
Height: 4 - 2 = 2 inches

Now, we multiply the length, width, and height to get the inner volume of one box:
3 x 4 x 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3:
24 x 3 = 72 cubic inches

The final answer is: 72"
"Let's count the hours Frankie watched TV on Monday and Tuesday. He watched 1 hour each night, so that's 1 + 1 = 2 hours.

On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's call the number of episodes he watched 'x'. Since each episode is 30 minutes, he watched 30x minutes of TV on Wednesday.

On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show. That's 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 hours.

On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes. That's 2 x 1 = 2 hours.

We know that Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in all. So, we can add up the hours he watched each day: 2 + 30x + 1.5 + 2 = 7.

Now, let's solve for x. We can start by subtracting 5.5 from both sides of the equation: 30x = 7 - 5.5
30x = 1.5

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 30 to find x: x = 1.5 / 30
x = 0.05

Since x is the number of episodes, and each episode is 30 minutes, we can multiply x by 30 to find the total minutes Frankie watched on Wednesday: 0.05 x 30 = 1.5 minutes.

But we want to know how many 30-minute episodes he watched, so we need to divide 1.5 by 30 to find the number of episodes: 1.5 / 30 = 0.05

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year. Let's say he made x cookies last year. So, this year he wants to make 2x cookies.

But he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he baked 2x + 15 cookies.

Then, he dropped 5 cookies, so he has 2x + 15 - 5 cookies left.

We know he has 110 cookies left, so we can set up the equation: 2x + 15 - 5 = 110.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 10 = 110.

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get 2x = 100.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 50.

So, Henry made 50 cookies last year.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much gas will cost after the cashback rewards, we need to first find out how much the cashback rewards will be. 

The gas costs $3.00 a gallon and the cashback is $.20 per gallon. If someone buys 10 gallons of gas, the cashback rewards will be 10 x $.20 = $2.00.

Now, we need to subtract the cashback rewards from the total cost of the gas. The total cost of the gas is 10 x $3.00 = $30.00. 

So, the total cost after the cashback rewards will be $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00.

The final answer is: $28.00"
"To find out how many roll-ups they ate on average, we need to find out how many roll-ups each of them ate and then divide by 2.

Marcell's roll-ups are 3 wide and 14 long, so he has 3 x 14 = 42 roll-ups.

Beatrice's roll-ups are 2 wide and 24 long, so she has 2 x 24 = 48 roll-ups.

Now, we add the number of roll-ups they both have: 42 + 48 = 90.

To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups by 2: 90 / 2 = 45.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many feet Julia rows in 64 seconds. We know it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. 

To find out how many feet she rows in 64 seconds, we can make a ratio. 

16 seconds / 20 feet = 64 seconds / x feet 

To find x, we can multiply 20 feet by 64/16. 

x = 20 * (64/16) 
x = 20 * 4 
x = 80 feet 

So, Julia rows 80 feet in 64 seconds. 

Now, we need to find out how much water the boat took on. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet. 

To find out how many sets of 10 feet are in 80 feet, we can divide 80 by 10. 

80 / 10 = 8 

So, the boat took on 8 sets of 10 feet. 

Since each set of 10 feet takes on 2 liters of water, we can multiply 8 by 2. 

8 * 2 = 16 

The boat took on 16 liters of water."

Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. It can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. So, Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This means the number of birds in Jamal's photograph is 300 / 50 = 6.

So, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.

"To find out how much profit Sasha makes, we need to first find out how much she gets from selling the lumber and then subtract the cost from that.

She has 10 boards that cost $10 each. If she sells them for the same price, she will get 10 x $10 = $100.

She has 5 boards that cost $16 each. If she sells them for the same price, she will get 5 x $16 = $80.

So, in total, she will get $100 + $80 = $180.

Now, we need to find out how much she spent on the lumber. She bought 10 boards for $10 each, so that's 10 x $10 = $100. She also bought 5 boards for $16 each, so that's 5 x $16 = $80. In total, she spent $100 + $80 = $180.

Since she gets $180 and she spent $180, she doesn't make any profit. 

The final answer is: $0"

We know that on the first day, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each. So, the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 x 5 = 10.

The next day, the total number of vehicles became 30. This means that the number of vehicles added on the second day is 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container has 5 vehicles, the number of containers added on the second day is 20 / 5 = 4.

Four years ago, Adrien's salary was $40000. So, Lylah's salary four years ago was 40000 / 1.3 = $30769.23.

Now, Adrien's salary increased by 40% four years later. So, his new salary is 40000 * 1.4 = $56000.

Lylah's salary also increased by 40% four years later. So, her new salary is 30769.23 * 1.4 = $43056.522.

The total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later is $56000 + $43056.522 = $99056.522.

The final answer is: $99057"
"Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week. There are 4 weeks in a month. So, he uses 2 pads a week * 4 weeks in a month = 8 pads a month. 

There are 30 sheets of paper in a pad. So, he uses 8 pads a month * 30 sheets in a pad = 240 sheets a month.

The answer is 240."
"Let's break it down. Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. 

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, so Kael brought 2 x 5 = 10 apples. 

Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, so Kael brought 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

Now, let's count the total number of fruits. Morisette brought 5 + 8 = 13 fruits. Kael brought 10 + 4 = 14 fruits. 

So, in total, they have 13 + 14 = 27 fruits.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. 

For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day. 

There are 5 days in a week, and she slept 8 hours on Monday. So, the two days she slept 6 hours each is 2 days. 

The rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day. There are 3 days in a week left, so she slept 7 hours each day for 3 days. 

So, the total hours she slept on those 3 days is 7 * 3 = 21 hours. 

Now, let's add up all the hours she slept: 
8 hours on Monday + 6 hours * 2 days = 8 + 12 = 20 hours 
20 hours + 21 hours = 41 hours

"Rosie runs 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. To find out how many miles she runs in 3 hours, we multiply 10 miles per hour by 3 hours. 

10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles

Now, Rosie runs 5 miles per hour. We need to find out how many hours are left after 3 hours. 7 hours - 3 hours = 4 hours.

Now, we multiply 5 miles per hour by 4 hours.

5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 20 miles

We add the miles Rosie ran in the first 3 hours to the miles she ran in the last 4 hours.

30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

"Let's break it down. Julia bought a package of spoons, then her husband gave her 5 more spoons. So, she had 5 spoons from her husband. Then, she used 3 spoons. Now, she has 12 spoons in total. 

To find out how many spoons Julia bought, we need to subtract the spoons she already had (5 from her husband) and the spoons she used (3) from the total number of spoons (12). 

12 (total spoons) - 5 (spoons from her husband) - 3 (spoons used) = 4

So, Julia bought 4 spoons.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs. Since each pepper costs 15$, a watermelon will cost 3 x 15 = 45$.

Next, we know that an orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs. So, an orange will cost 45 - 5 = 40$.

Now, we need to find the total cost of the items Dillon is buying. 

- 4 watermelons will cost 4 x 45 = 180$
- 20 peppers will cost 20 x 15 = 300$
- 10 oranges will cost 10 x 40 = 400$

To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we add the costs of all the items together: 180 + 300 + 400 = 880$

"First, we need to find out how many hours the doctors work in a day.  We know the hospital sees 500 people a day and each patient is seen for 24 minutes.  We need to convert 24 minutes to hours.  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours.

Now, we multiply the number of patients by the time each patient is seen. 500 patients * 0.4 hours = 200 hours.

The doctors charge $150 an hour, so the hospital pays the doctors 200 hours * $150 = $30,000.

The hospital charges the patients $200 an hour.  The patients are seen for 200 hours, so the hospital charges the patients 200 hours * $200 = $40,000.

The hospital's profit is the amount of money they charge the patients minus the amount they pay the doctors.  So, the profit is $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

The final answer is: $10,000"

Now, we need to multiply the number of car washes he gets in a year by the cost of each car wash.

48 car washes/year * $15/car wash = $720/year

So, Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes."

So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. 

Now, we need to find out how many of these unicorns are female. We know that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. 

To find two thirds of 9, we need to multiply 9 by 2 and then divide by 3.

First, multiply 9 by 2:

"Let's break it down. 

There are 700 bees in total. 

Let's say the number of baby bees is x. Then the number of queens is x/2, because there are twice as many babies as queens. 

The total number of bees is the sum of the number of baby bees, worker bees, and queens. We know that the number of worker bees is twice the number of baby bees, so the number of worker bees is 2x. 

So, the total number of bees is x + 2x + x/2. 

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so we can write the equation: x + 2x + x/2 = 700. 

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2. 

This gives us 2x + 4x + x = 1400. 

Combine like terms: 7x = 1400. 

Now, divide both sides by 7: x = 200. 

Now that we know the number of baby bees is 200, we can find the number of worker bees. The number of worker bees is twice the number of baby bees, so the number of worker bees is 2x = 2 * 200 = 400.

The final answer is: 400"

There's a 10% tax on nonfood items, so we need to find 10% of 10 dollars. 

10% of 10 dollars is 1 dollar. 

So, the total tax on nonfood items is 1 dollar. 

Now, we need to add the tax to the cost of the nonfood items. 

10 + 1 = 11 dollars. 

The food items are milk and eggs. 

Milk costs 2 dollars and eggs cost 3 dollars. 

2 + 3 = 5 dollars.

First, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. Then, 1/2 of that many bees return, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees. So, there are 15 bees that returned in the next 6 hours.

In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the first 30 leave the hive, which is 2 x 30 = 60 bees.

Now, we know that 30 bees left in the first 6 hours and 15 bees returned in the next 6 hours. So, 30 - 15 = 15 bees didn't return yet.

In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left before that hadn't already returned return to the hive. That means all 15 bees that didn't return yet come back.

So, in the last 6 hours, 15 bees return to the hive.

"To find out who will win the race, we need to find out how long it will take each of them to get home. 

First, we need to convert the distance to feet because their speeds are in feet per minute. 

Steve's distance is 3 miles. Since 1 mile is 5280 feet, Steve's distance is 3 x 5280 = 15840 feet. 

Tim's distance is 2 miles. Since 1 mile is 5280 feet, Tim's distance is 2 x 5280 = 10560 feet.

Now, we need to find out how long it will take each of them to get home. 

Steve's speed is 440 feet per minute. To find out how long it will take him to get home, we need to divide his distance by his speed. 

Steve's time = 15840 / 440 = 36 minutes.

Tim's speed is 264 feet per minute. To find out how long it will take him to get home, we need to divide his distance by his speed. 

Tim's time = 10560 / 264 = 40 minutes.

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will win the race. 

To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to subtract the winner's time from the loser's time. 

Winner's time = 36 minutes
Loser's time = 40 minutes

Waiting time = Loser's time - Winner's time
Waiting time = 40 - 36

Now, there are 14 - 7 = 7 fries left. 

Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 x 3 = 9 fries. 

Now, there are 7 - 9 = -2 fries left. But we can't have a negative number of fries, so let's think about it. The pigeons ate 9 fries, but there were only 7 fries left. That means there were not enough fries for the pigeons to eat 9. So, the pigeons must have eaten all the fries that were left. 

So, the pigeons ate 7 fries. 

Now, a raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries. But there are no fries left, so the raccoon must have eaten all the fries that were left. 

So, the raccoon ate 7 fries. 

Now, ants ate 1 fry, and 5 fries were left. 

Let's go back to the beginning. The raccoon ate 7 fries, and before that, the pigeons ate 7 fries. Before that, the seagull ate 7 fries. And before that, Dave ate 14 fries. 

So, the total number of fries that were eaten is 14 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 35 fries.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 100 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards. She does this 34 times. So, she runs 100 + 80 = 180 yards each time. She does this 34 times, so she runs 180 x 34 = 6120 yards.

Now, we need to find out who ran farther. Blake ran 1500 yards and Kelly ran 6120 yards. Kelly ran farther than Blake.

"Let's figure this out. 

First, we know one red car costs $4. So, 5 red cars will cost 5 x $4 = $20.

We also know that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures. And one action figure costs $5. So, 3 action figures will cost 3 x $5 = $15. The doll also costs $15.

Now, we know the cost of all the toys: 5 red cars ($20), 3 action figures ($15), and 1 doll ($15). 

So, the total cost of all the toys is $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.

"Let's count the money Elvira spent on the computer and accessories. 

The computer costs €1090. 
The scanner costs €157. 
The CD burner costs €74. 
The printer costs €102. 

We add these numbers together: 1090 + 157 = 1247 
1247 + 74 = 1321 
1321 + 102 = 1423 

So, Elvira spent €1423 on the computer and accessories. 

Elvira had a budget of €1500. 

To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the money she spent from her budget: 1500 - 1423 = 77 

Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing.

"Sandra needs 15 Spanish flans and each flan needs 3 eggs. So, she needs 15 x 3 eggs. 

15 x 3 = 45 eggs

She gets 9 eggs each time she babysits. To find out how many times she needs to babysit, we need to divide the total number of eggs she needs by the number of eggs she gets each time. 

45 ÷ 9 = 5

So, Sandra has to babysit 5 times."
"Let's say Brooke's age is x. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's age is 2x.

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be x + 2 and Seth's age will be 2x + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be (x + 2) + (2x + 2) = 3x + 4.

We know that the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can set up the equation 3x + 4 = 28.

To solve for x, we need to subtract 4 from both sides of the equation: 3x = 24.

Next, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 8.

Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's age is 2x = 2(8) = 16.

There are 7 days in a week. 

Pancho walks 20 miles on 5 days (Monday to Friday) and 10 miles on 2 days (Saturday and Sunday). 

So, he walks 20 miles * 5 days = 100 miles on 5 days. 
And he walks 10 miles * 2 days = 20 miles on 2 days. 

Now, let's add the miles he walked on both days.

"To find the cost of the uniform, we need to find the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants. 

The hat costs $25. 

The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so it costs 3 x $25 = $75.

The pants cost the average of the hat and jacket, so we need to add the cost of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. 

The cost of the hat is $25 and the cost of the jacket is $75. 

$25 + $75 = $100. 

$100 / 2 = $50.

So the pants cost $50.

Now we need to add the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of the uniform. 

$25 (hat) + $75 (jacket) + $50 (pants) = $150.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old. 

Now, we have the ages of all the birds: Sally Four is 8, Sally Thirtytwo is 8, Granny Red is 16, and Sally Two is 19. 
To find the total age, we add them together: 8 + 8 + 16 + 19 = 51.

"To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to find out how much she pays each month first. 

Her student loans have a minimum payment of $300, but she wants to pay 50% more than that. 50% of $300 is $150. So, she will pay $300 + $150 = $450 for her student loans.

Her credit card's minimum is $200, and she wants to pay 50% more than that. 50% of $200 is $100. So, she will pay $200 + $100 = $300 for her credit card.

Her mortgage's minimum is $500, and she wants to pay 50% more than that. 50% of $500 is $250. So, she will pay $500 + $250 = $750 for her mortgage.

Now, we need to add up all the payments. $450 + $300 + $750 = $1500. 

So, Jessica pays $1500 each month. 

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply $1500 by 12. 

$1500 * 12 = $18,000.

"To find out how long it takes Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to add up the time it takes to peel and cut all the potatoes.

First, let's find out how long it takes to peel all the potatoes. It takes 1.5 minutes to peel one potato, and there are 60 potatoes. So, it will take 1.5 x 60 = 90 minutes to peel all the potatoes.

Next, let's find out how long it takes to cut all the potatoes. It takes 5 seconds to cut one potato, and there are 60 potatoes. So, it will take 5 x 60 = 300 seconds to cut all the potatoes.

Now, we need to convert the time it takes to cut all the potatoes from seconds to minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 300 seconds is 300 / 60 = 5 minutes.

Now, we add the time it takes to peel all the potatoes (90 minutes) and the time it takes to cut all the potatoes (5 minutes). 90 + 5 = 95 minutes.

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, they make $0.50 x 20 = $10 per gallon.

They sell each glass for $0.50 and make a profit of $25. So, they sold 25 / 0.50 = 50 glasses.

Since they get 20 glasses per gallon, they made 50 / 20 = 2.5 gallons.

They make $10 per gallon, so they made 2.5 x 10 = $25 from selling lemonade.

They made $25 in profit, so they made $25 + $25 = $50 in total.

It costs $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar per gallon. So, it costs $3 + $2 = $5 per gallon.

They made 2.5 gallons, so they spent 2.5 x 5 = $12.50 on lemons.

"Let's break it down step by step.

Zaid earns 6000$ per month. 

He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 * 6000 = 1500$.

He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 1/3 * 6000 = 2000$.

Now, let's subtract the rent and car fuel expenses from his salary: 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500$.

He donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity, which is 1/2 * 2500 = 1250$.

Now, let's subtract the donation from the remaining amount: 2500 - 1250 = 1250$.

He gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$, so let's subtract these amounts from the remaining amount: 1250 - 200 - 700 = 350$.

So, Zaid will have 350$ left after all these expenses and donations.

The less well-rounded team's first runner runs 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Now we add up the less well-rounded team's times: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

The faster team's time is 220 seconds and the less well-rounded team's time is 162 seconds. The difference is 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

"To find out how much more likely it is that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probability of each event and then find the difference.

First, let's find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die (4, 5, and 6). So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 or 1/2.

Now, let's find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, the probability of rolling an even number is 3/6 or 1/2. To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we multiply the probability of the first event by the probability of the second event: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

Now, we need to find the difference between the two probabilities. To do this, we subtract the smaller probability from the larger one: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/4) * 100 = 25%.

So, it is 25% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

We also know that 20 pieces of straw are given to the rabbits.

Now, we know that 160 pieces of straw are given to the small rodents. We already know that 50 + 20 = 70 pieces of straw are given to the hamsters and rabbits. So, the remaining straw is given to the rats. 

Remaining straw for rats = 160 - 70 = 90.

We know that the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Let's say the number of rats in each cage is 'r'. Then, the total number of rats in 3 cages is 3r.

The total straw given to rats is 90. Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw. So, the total number of rats is 90 / 6 = 15.

Since there are 3 cages, the number of rats in each cage is 15 / 3 = 5.

Second month, Mandy will pay 2% of $98, which is 0.02 x 98 = $1.96. So, Mandy will pay $1.96 and the remaining amount will be $98 - $1.96 = $96.04.

Third month, Mandy will pay 2% of $96.04, which is 0.02 x 96.04 = $1.9208. So, Mandy will pay $1.92 and the remaining amount will be $96.04 - $1.92 = $94.12.

Now, Mandy will pay the remaining amount of $94.12 and the interest for the third month, which is $1.92. So, Mandy will pay $94.12 + $1.92 = $96.04.

"John gets a 5% raise in salary. 5% of 2000 is 100. So, his new salary is 2000 + 100 = 2100.

He gets $5000 for the award. 

He works 52 weeks in a year. His new salary is 2100. So, he makes 2100 * 52 = 109200.

He also gets the $5000 award. So, he makes 109200 + 5000 = 114200.

The answer is 114200."
"Josie has 10 acres of grapes. Each acre makes 5 tons of grapes. So, 10 acres will make 10 x 5 = 50 tons of grapes.

"Let's break it down. 

Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch, and he used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. There are 7 days in a week, so he ate 7 sandwiches. That's 7 x 2 = 14 slices of cheese for sandwiches.

He ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, and he used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. So, he used 3 slices per omelet. That's 3 x 3 = 9 slices of cheese for omelets.

He used 8 slices of cheese in the macaroni and cheese dish.

To find the total number of slices of cheese he used, we add the slices from sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish. 

14 (sandwiches) + 9 (omelets) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31

"Janet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. That's 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens. Each bag has 9 pens, so 6 x 9 = 54 blue pens.

She also bought 2 bags of red pens. Each bag has 6 pens, so 2 x 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, we add all the pens together: 32 (green and yellow) + 54 (blue) + 12 (red) = 98 pens.

The final answer is: 98"
"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we need to first find the total score she needs for the six tests. 

We know that Mr. Bert gives six tests and Brinley wants an average of 93. To find the total score, we multiply the average by the number of tests: 93 x 6 = 558.

Now, we need to find the total score Brinley has so far. We know her scores on the first five tests: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. We add these scores together: 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 338.

Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester, we need to find the lowest score among the first five tests. The lowest score is 71.

We remove the lowest score from the total score: 338 - 71 = 267.

Now, we add the score Brinley needs on the sixth test to the total score: 267 + x = 558, where x is the score Brinley needs on the sixth test.

To find x, we subtract 267 from both sides of the equation: x = 558 - 267.

x = 291.

"Micheal rode the bike 5 times a week for 4 weeks. That's 5 x 4 = 20 times. He rode 25 kilometers each time, so that's 20 x 25 = 500 kilometers.

Then, he rode the bike 2 times a week for 3 weeks. That's 2 x 3 = 6 times. He rode 60 kilometers each time, so that's 6 x 60 = 360 kilometers.

Now, we add the kilometers from both times. 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

The final answer is: 860"
"Let's figure this out. We know there are 25 chocolate bars and each one weighs 40g. So, we multiply 25 by 40 to find the total weight of the chocolate bars. 

25 x 40 = 1000g

We also know there are 80 candied apples. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs 40 / 2 = 20g.

Now, we multiply 80 by 20 to find the total weight of the candied apples.

80 x 20 = 1600g

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy.

1000g + 1600g = 2600g

"Let's break it down step by step. 

On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes. 

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. Three times 4 is 3 x 4 = 12. So, on Tuesday, she bought 12 cakes. 

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. Five times 12 is 5 x 12 = 60. So, on Wednesday, she bought 60 cakes.

Now, let's add up the number of cakes she bought on all three days. 4 + 12 + 60 = 76.

The final answer is: 76"
"Let's break it down. 

We know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. 

First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, half a dozen plates will cost 6 x $6000 = $36000.

Now, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than $36000. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, twenty dozen cups will be 20 x 12 = 240 cups.

To find the cost of each cup, we need to divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups. 

Cost of each cup = $34800 / 240 cups = $145.

The final answer is: $145"
"Sara wants a jacket for $30 and 2 pairs of shoes for $20 each. That's $30 + $40 = $70 total.

She already has $10 saved. She earns $5 each time she babysits. She needs $70 - $10 = $60 more.

She earns $5 each time she babysits, so she needs to babysit $60 / $5 = 12 times to earn enough money.

But she also earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. We need to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining money.

She needs to earn $60 more. She can earn this by babysitting or mowing the lawn. 

Let's say she babysits x times and mows the lawn y times. We know that x + y = 12 (because she needs to babysit 12 times to earn enough money). We also know that 5x + 4y = 60 (because she earns $5 each time she babysits and $4 each time she mows the lawn, and she needs to earn $60).

We can solve this problem by substituting x = 12 - y into the second equation. This gives us 5(12 - y) + 4y = 60.

Expanding the equation, we get 60 - 5y + 4y = 60.

Combine like terms: -y = 0.

Divide by -1: y = 0.

This means she doesn't need to mow the lawn at all. She can just babysit 12 times to earn enough money.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's say the number of red chickens is x. Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, the number of white chickens is x + 2.

Red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, so they produce 3x eggs in total. White chickens produce 5 eggs a day, so they produce 5(x + 2) eggs in total.

The total number of eggs is 42, so we can set up the equation: 3x + 5(x + 2) = 42

Simplifying the equation, we get: 3x + 5x + 10 = 42
Combine like terms: 8x + 10 = 42
Subtract 10 from both sides: 8x = 32
Divide both sides by 8: x = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we need to know how far he walks and how fast he walks. 

The park is a rectangle, and we know its length and width. To find the distance around the park, we need to add the length and width together, and then multiply by 2 because there are two sides of each length and width. 

So, the distance around the park is (1.5 + 6) * 2 = 14.5 miles.

Now, we know how far Gary walks (14.5 miles) and how fast he walks (3 miles/hour). To find out how many hours he spends walking, we need to divide the distance by the speed.

14.5 miles / 3 miles/hour = 4.83 hours

"Let's say the small pool has x gallons of water. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had 2x gallons of water. 

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, in 4 minutes, each pool lost 4 gallons. So, the small pool now has x - 4 gallons and the big pool now has 2x - 4 gallons.

We know that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, we can write an equation: 2x - 4 = 4(x - 4)

Solving the equation: 
2x - 4 = 4x - 16
2x - 4x = -16 + 4
-2x = -12
x = 6

So, the small pool had 6 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since it leaks at 4 gallons/minute, in 4 minutes, it lost 4 gallons. 

The small pool now has 6 - 4 = 2 gallons of water.

The final answer is: 2"

She makes $8.00 an hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work, we need to divide the money she needs by the money she makes per hour. 

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

So, Lori has to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. 

First, we need to find out how much she will pay in total. She will pay $165 a month for 12 months. 

$165 x 12 = $1980

She borrowed $2000 and has to pay $1980. So, she will pay back the amount she borrowed and some extra. The extra amount is 10% of $2000. 

10% of $2000 is 0.1 x $2000 = $200

So, she will pay $200 extra. 

Now, we need to find out how much she will have paid in total. 

$1980 (the amount she borrowed) + $200 (the extra amount) = $2180

She will have paid $2180. But she borrowed $2000. So, her remaining balance will be $2180 - $2000 = $180.

Harriet is 21 years old now. 

Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is 2 times Harriet's age. 
Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age = 2 * 21 = 42 years old.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet. 
Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age = 3 * 21 = 63 years old.

Now, let's find their ages in three years. 
Harriet's age in 3 years = 21 + 3 = 24 years old.
Zack's age in 3 years = 42 + 3 = 45 years old.
Adrian's age in 3 years = 63 + 3 = 66 years old.

To find the average age, we need to add their ages and divide by 3. 
Average age = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Naomi scored 68 points. 
Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. 
Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 
Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points. 

Now, we know that Naomi and Yuri scored 68 + 44 = 112 points together. 
Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points. 
Now, we know that Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna scored 112 + 85 = 197 points together.

After the movie is done, she gets a 10% discount. 10% of $30,000 is 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000. 

So, the discount is $3,000. 

The final cost is $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

$27,000."
"Let's add up all the money Isabelle spent. 

$12 (cake) + $43 (presents) = $55
$55 + $15 (decorations) = $70
$70 + $4 (invitations) = $74
$74 + $22 (goodie bags) = $96

Now, we need to split the cost evenly with her two parents. So, we need to divide the total cost by 3. 

$96 ÷ 3 = $32

Each person paid $32."
"The chef bought 4 bags of onions. Each bag weighs 50 pounds. So, the total weight of onions is 4 x 50 = 200 pounds. 

A pound of onions cost $1.50. So, the total cost of onions is 200 x $1.50 = $300.

The chef spent $300."
"Let's break it down. 

On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate 5 x 4 = 20 cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate 13 x 2 = 26 cookies.

Now, let's add up the cookies Sue and her sister ate. Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies. Her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue ate 46 x 200 = 9200 calories. Her sister ate 18 x 200 = 3600 calories.

To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to subtract the calories her sister ate from the calories Sue ate. 9200 - 3600 = 5600.

The final answer is: 5600"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that the school is 50% boys and 50% girls. This means that the total number of boys and girls in the school is equal. 

Since there are 3 classes, and each class has 20 students, the total number of students in the school is 3 x 20 = 60.

We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the school is 15 + 12 = 27.

Since the school is 50% girls, the total number of boys in the school is also 27 (because 50% of 60 is 30, but we already know there are 27 girls, so the boys must be 27 too).

Now, let's find out how many girls are in the third class. We know that the total number of girls in the school is 27, and the first two classes have 15 + 12 = 27 girls. This means that there are no girls in the third class.

Since the third class has 20 students, and there are no girls, the number of boys in the third class is 20.

The number of boys in the third class is 20."
"Travis had 61 apps. He deleted 9 apps, so he had 61 - 9 = 52 apps left. Then, he downloaded 18 more apps. So, now he has 52 + 18 = 70 apps.

"Let's break it down. 

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. 

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. If we let the number of cougars be x, then the number of wolves is 3x. 

We also know that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, the number of cougars today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since the number of cougars today is 12, we can set up the equation 3x = 12. To find x, we divide both sides by 3. x = 12 / 3 = 4. 

So, the number of cougars today is 12 and the number of wolves is 3x = 3 * 4 = 12.

The total number of animals Rick killed last night is 10 + 15 = 25. The total number of animals Rick killed today is 12 + 12 = 24.

The total number of animals Rick killed is 25 + 24 = 49.

"First, I need to find out how much money Brady has in pennies, nickels, and dimes. 

100 pennies is 100 x 1 cent = 100 cents. 
40 nickels is 40 x 5 cents = 200 cents. 
20 dimes is 20 x 10 cents = 200 cents.

Now, I need to add all the cents together. 100 cents + 200 cents + 200 cents = 500 cents.

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, I need to divide 500 cents by 100 to get the dollars. 500 ÷ 100 = 5.

Brady has 5 dollars from the coins. 

Now, I need to add the dollar bills. Brady has 40 dollar bills, so that's 40 x 1 dollar = 40 dollars.

Now, I need to add the dollars from the coins and the dollar bills. 5 dollars + 40 dollars = 45 dollars.

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to know how many 10-foot sections it has. The redwood is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to find out how many sections it has. 

200 / 10 = 20

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section.

20 * 400 = 8000

Now, termites ate 30% of the wood. To find 30% of 8000, we multiply 8000 by 0.3.

8000 * 0.3 = 2400

The termites ate 2400 pounds of wood. To find the weight of the redwood after the termites ate some, we subtract 2400 from 8000.

8000 - 2400 = 5600

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Andrea has 52 apples. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now, let's count the total number of fruits. Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, and Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas. 

Total number of fruits = (Andrea's apples + Andrea's bananas) + (Jamal's apples + Jamal's bananas)
Total number of fruits = (52 + 24) + (44 + 48)
Total number of fruits = 76 + 92
Total number of fruits = 168

"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we need to know how many cookies she's making in total. She's making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. 

36 + 30 = 66 cookies

Since two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies, we need to find out how many dozens of cookies Carla is making. A dozen is 12 cookies. 

66 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5.5 dozen cookies

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 1 dozen cookies, we need to multiply the number of dozens by 2.

5.5 dozen cookies * 2 cups per dozen = 11 cups of flour

So Carla needs 11 cups of flour.

The selling price is $350,000. 
The brokerage fee is 5% of $350,000, which is 0.05 x $350,000 = $17,500.
The transfer fee is 12% of $350,000, which is 0.12 x $350,000 = $42,000.

Now, we add the brokerage fee and the transfer fee to the selling price: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

The total price of the house is $409,500. 

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. 

To find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to subtract her budget from the total price: $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much Mr. Tan paid for the transfer fees. The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price, which is $400 000. 

3% of $400 000 is 3/100 * 400 000 = $12 000.

Next, we need to find out how much Mr. Tan paid for the brokerage fee. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is $400 000.

5% of $400 000 is 5/100 * 400 000 = $20 000.

Now, we need to find out the total amount Mr. Tan paid for the transfer fees and the brokerage fee. 

$12 000 + $20 000 = $32 000.

Mr. Tan also paid $250 000 for the remaining loan amount of the house.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know the body of the sweater takes 900 stitches. The collar takes a tenth of that number, so it's 900 / 10 = 90 stitches. 

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it's 2 x 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know the total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800. We already know the body, collar, and rosette take 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches. 

To find out how many stitches the sleeves take, we subtract the total stitches of the body, collar, and rosette from the total number of stitches in the sweater. So, 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, we need to divide the number of stitches by 2 to find out how many stitches each sleeve takes. 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

Let's say Mico's age is x and Marco's age is 20 - x. In 10 years, Mico's age will be x + 10 and Marco's age will be (20 - x) + 10.

We can simplify (20 - x) + 10 to 30 - x.

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be (x + 10) + (30 - x).

According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So, we can write the equation: 6x + 9 = 3(x + 9)

Now, let's solve the equation: 
6x + 9 = 3x + 27
6x - 3x = 27 - 9
3x = 18

To find the total number of spots on the mambas, we multiply the number of mambas by the number of spots on each mamba: 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.

Now, we add the total number of spots on the cobras and the mambas: 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

"To find out how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to know how much space the topaz gemstones take up and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace. 

Each topaz gemstone is one inch long, and there are 8 of them. So, the topaz gemstones take up 8 inches of space. 

The necklace is 25 inches long, and the topaz gemstones take up 8 inches, so the space left for the sterling silver beads is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, so we need to divide the space left for the beads (17 inches) by the length of each bead (1/4 inch). 

17 inches is the same as 17 x 4 = 68 quarter inches. 

So, we divide 68 quarter inches by 1 quarter inch per bead, which is 68 / 1 = 68 beads.

The car in the fast lane traveled 480 miles. We need to find out how long it took for the car in the slow lane to travel the same distance. To do this, we need to divide the distance by the speed of the car in the slow lane. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"Let's break it down. Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals. 

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals. They have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting, so the total medals given out is 10 times more than what they have. 

Let's call the total medals given out 'x'. Then, x - 39 = 10x. We need to solve for x. 

First, we add 39 to both sides: x = 10x + 39. 

Then, we subtract 10x from both sides: -9x = 39. 

Now, we divide both sides by -9: x = -39 / 9. 

x = -4.33. But we can't have a fraction of a medal, so we'll round up to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we can't round up because we are looking for the total number of medals given out. So we will round down to the nearest whole number. But we can't round down because we are looking for the total number of medals given out. So we will just leave it as is.

However, we can't have a negative number of medals given out. So we need to recheck our math. Let's go back to x - 39 = 10x.

"First, we need to find out how many chocolate bars there are in total. There are 8 packets of chocolate bars and each packet has 5 chocolate bars. So, we multiply 8 by 5 to get the total number of chocolate bars.

8 x 5 = 40

Now, we know that 4 adults will get 6 chocolate bars each. So, we multiply 4 by 6 to find out how many chocolate bars the adults will get.

4 x 6 = 24

Now, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children. We subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults got from the total number of chocolate bars.

40 - 24 = 16

Now, we know that there are 8 children and they will share the remaining chocolate bars equally. So, we divide 16 by 8 to find out how many chocolate bars each child will get.

16 ÷ 8 = 2

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

"Let's break it down. Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. That's 3 hours. But she pauses for half an hour, so she works for 2.5 hours. 

There are 60 minutes in an hour. So, 2.5 hours is 2.5 x 60 = 150 minutes. 

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. So, in 150 minutes, she earns 150 / 10 = 15 lots of $5. 

15 lots of $5 is 15 x $5 = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Mike has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points. 
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

Now, let's see who gets an extra point in the fourth round. 
Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point. 
Jim has 18 points, so he doesn't get an extra point. 
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point.

Now, let's add the extra points. 
Mike has 21 + 1 = 22 points. 
Jim has 18 points.

"Let's break it down. 

On the first day, Darren did 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses. 

On the second day, he did 20 more pushups than the first day, so that's 100 + 20 = 120 pushups. 
He did ten fewer squats, so that's 50 - 10 = 40 squats. 
He doubled the number of dumbbell presses, so that's 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses.

Now, let's add up the activities for both days. 
Day 1: 100 + 50 + 20 = 170
Day 2: 120 + 40 + 40 = 200
Total activities: 170 + 200 = 370

"To find out how many days the rice will last, we need to know how much rice is eaten in a day. 

There are 5 people eating rice every lunch and dinner, that's 2 meals a day. Each person eats 0.2 kg of rice per meal. 

So, 5 people eat 5 x 0.2 kg = 1 kg of rice per meal. 

Since they eat 2 meals a day, they eat 1 kg x 2 = 2 kg of rice per day. 

Now, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. 

42 kg / 2 kg per day = 21 days. 

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide 21 days by 7 to find out how many weeks the rice will last. 

21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks. 

The rice will last for 3 weeks.

"Let's count the crates Sam sold. 

He sold 20 crates over the weekend. 
On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates. 
On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.

So, Sam sold 65 crates. 

Now, we need to find out how many crates he was off from his target.

He sold 65 crates. 

120 - 65 = 55 

Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week.

"To find out how much John pays a year for driving, we need to find out how much he pays per day, then multiply it by the number of days he goes to work in a year.

First, let's find out how many miles John drives in a day. He goes to work 30 miles away and comes back, so that's 30 + 30 = 60 miles per day.

He gets charged $2 per mile, so he pays 60 x $2 = $120 per day.

He goes to work 5 days a week, so he pays 5 x $120 = $600 per week.

There are 50 weeks in a year, so he pays 50 x $600 = $30,000 per year.

But he also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he pays 12 x $150 = $1,800 per year.

Elise sold 45 books this year. 

Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, she sold 2 x 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We know that there are 50 unsold books left now. So, the total number of books she sold in 3 years is 250 - 50 = 200.

We already know that she sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books this year. So, the number of books she sold in the second year is 200 - 90 - 45 = 65.

Each book sells at 20$. So, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 65 x 20 = 1300.

Watson earns $10 per hour. So, he earns 200 x $10 = $2000 in a month.

He also gets a $300 bonus each week. So, he gets 4 x $300 = $1200 bonus in a month.

Watson's total money in a month is $2000 + $1200 = $3200.

2 tubs of ice cream will cost 2 x $11 = $22.

Next, let's find out how much 4 packets of milk will cost at the discounted price. 
The original price of a packet of milk is not given, but we know that it was sold at a discount of $0.5. So, let's call the original price of a packet of milk 'x'. Then, the discounted price of a packet of milk is x - $0.5. 
4 packets of milk will cost 4(x - $0.5).

We don't know the original price of a packet of milk, so let's call the original price of a packet of milk 'x'. The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $13 = $26. The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4x.

The total amount you will pay for 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk at the discounted price is $22 + 4(x - $0.5). 
The total amount you will pay for 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk at the original price is $26 + 4x.

To find out how much you will save, we need to subtract the total amount you will pay at the discounted price from the total amount you will pay at the original price. 
So, the amount you will save is ($26 + 4x) - ($22 + 4(x - $0.5)).

Simplifying the equation, we get:
$26 + 4x - $22 - 4x + $2 = $6 + $2
$6 + $2 = $8

The final answer is: $8"
"Let's count the new limbs. 

First, we need to find out how many extra arms Helena's serum will make. We know that she grows an extra arm every three days. So, in 15 days, she will grow 15 / 3 = 5 extra arms.

Next, we need to find out how many extra legs Helena's serum will make. We know that she grows an extra leg every five days. So, in 15 days, she will grow 15 / 5 = 3 extra legs.

Now, we need to add the extra arms and legs together to find the total number of new limbs. 5 extra arms + 3 extra legs = 8 new limbs.

"Let's break it down step by step.

Theo has $6000. He buys 6 business suits at $100 each, so that's 6 x $100 = $600. He also buys 3 suitcases at $50 each, so that's 3 x $50 = $150. 

The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. The cost of a business suit is $100, so 5 times that is 5 x $100 = $500. $700 more than that is $500 + $700 = $1200. 

So far, Theo has spent $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950. He wants to save $2000, so he has $6000 - $1950 = $4050 left. 

The answer is: $4050"
"Let's break it down. There are 5 people in the family. Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 eggs. The rest of the people, which is 5 - 3 = 2, eat 2 eggs each day. So, 2 x 2 = 4 eggs. 

Now, we add the eggs eaten by both groups: 9 + 4 = 13 eggs per day. Since they eat eggs every day, we multiply the number of eggs eaten per day by 7 (the number of days in a week): 13 x 7 = 91 eggs.

Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old. 

Since Noah was half as old as Cera six years ago, Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.

The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, so it was 3000 * 20 = 60000.

If the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now, then the current population is 2 * 60000 = 120000.

"Let's break it down. 

There are 105 members in total. 

Let's say the number of players on the defense is x. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x. 

And there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is x/2. 

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. 

So, x + 2x + x/2 = 105. 

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying both sides by 2. 

2x + 4x + x = 210 

Combine like terms: 7x = 210 

Now, divide both sides by 7: x = 30 

The number of players on the defense is 30.

"Let's count the people first. Martha invited 2 families with 6 people, that's 2 x 6 = 12 people. Then she invited 3 families with 4 people, that's 3 x 4 = 12 people. So, in total, she invited 12 + 12 = 24 people.

But 8 people couldn't come due to illness. That leaves 24 - 8 = 16 people.

Then, 1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments. 1/4 of 8 is 8 / 4 = 2. So, 2 people had previous commitments. That leaves 16 - 2 = 14 people.

"Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna. He already had 50 marbles in the store. So, he now has 20 + 50 = 70 marbles.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 2/5 of 20 is 8. So, his father gave him 8 marbles.

Now, Solomon has 70 + 8 = 78 marbles.

Each marble weighs 2kgs. To find the total weight, we multiply the number of marbles by the weight of each marble. 78 * 2 = 156.

"Let's break it down. 

If there are 30 boys, and there are 3 times as many girls as boys, then there are 3 x 30 = 90 girls.

We also know that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, so there are 1/10 x 30 = 3 nongendered children.

To find the total number of children, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children together: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

The final answer is: 123"

If there are 45 wires, we need to find out how many groups of 3 wires there are. We can do this by dividing 45 by 3. 

45 ÷ 3 = 15

Since the ratio is 1:3, for every 3 wires, there is 1 pole. So, we need to multiply the number of groups of wires by 1.

15 x 1 = 15

The total number of electric poles required is 15."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

There were 25 men and 15 women at the party. So, the total number of people is 25 + 15 = 40.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. 1/4 of 40 is 10. So, 10 people left the party.

Now, we know that 22 men stayed at the party. This means 25 - 22 = 3 men left the party.

Since 10 people left the party, and 3 of them were men, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7.

Initially, there were 15 women. Now, 7 women left. So, the number of women left is 15 - 7 = 8.

$2 - $1 = $1.

The pen costs $1."
"Let's solve the problem. 

Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which makes a total of 26 pencils. We need to find out how many pencils are in each box. 

To do that, we need to subtract the loose pencils from the total number of pencils. 

26 (total pencils) - 2 (loose pencils) = 24 pencils

Now, we know that 24 pencils are in 3 boxes. To find out how many pencils are in each box, we need to divide 24 by 3.

24 ÷ 3 = 8 pencils in each box.

Now, we know that Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils in each box, and Meg has 46 pencils. To find out how many boxes they need in total, we need to add the number of pencils in Jam's boxes to Meg's pencils, and then divide by the number of pencils in each box.

First, let's add the number of pencils in Jam's boxes to Meg's pencils. 

3 boxes * 8 pencils/box = 24 pencils (Jam's pencils)
24 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 70 pencils

Now, we need to divide 70 by the number of pencils in each box, which is 8.

70 ÷ 8 = 8.75

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. 

8.75 → 9

So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. 

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how many milliliters weaker the coffee is, we need to know how many ice cubes were added. 

Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. The coffee was cooled by 65 degrees. To find out how many ice cubes were added, we need to divide 65 by 13. 

65 ÷ 13 = 5

So, 5 ice cubes were added. Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. 

5 ice cubes * 12 milliliters = 60 milliliters

Shannon also added 15 milliliters of cream. 

60 milliliters (from ice cubes) + 15 milliliters (from cream) = 75 milliliters

The coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

So, the 5 people brought in 14 old records."
"Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many junior programmers there are. We know that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees. 

Total employees = 100
Junior programmers = 2/5 * 100 = 40

Now, we know that senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers. Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month. So, senior programmers are paid $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

We also know that the total number of programmers is 100, and 40 of them are junior programmers. So, the number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money the company pays to junior programmers per month:
40 junior programmers * $2000 = $80000

And let's calculate the total amount of money the company pays to senior programmers per month:
60 senior programmers * $2400 = $144000

20 (at the third stop) + 7 (got down at the second stop) = 27 people at the second stop.

Now, at the second stop, 8 people got in. So, we need to subtract those 8 people from the total at the second stop to find out how many people were on the bus at the first stop. 

27 (at the second stop) - 8 (got in at the second stop) = 19 people at the first stop.

Now, at the first stop, 5 people got in. So, we need to subtract those 5 people from the total at the first stop to find out how many people were on the bus at the terminal.

"To find out how long it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to know how many percentage points it needs to charge. Since it's already at 60%, it needs to charge 100% - 60% = 40% more.

Since it charges 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we need to find out how many 3-minute intervals are in 40%. We can do this by dividing 40 by 1 (since it charges 1 percentage point per 3 minutes).

40 / 1 = 40

So, it needs 40 intervals of 3 minutes each to charge 40%. To find the total time, we multiply 40 intervals by 3 minutes per interval.

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

120 / 60 = 2

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

Job B: 
- Pay per year: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000

"Let's say the number of students in the two equal groups is x. 

Since the last group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the last group is x - 10.

He watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so he watched 3 * 2 = 6 hours of shows.

He watched 30% of his time watching shows. Let's call the total time he spent x. Then 30% of x is 6 hours. We can write this as 0.3x = 6. To find x, we divide both sides by 0.3. x = 6 / 0.3 = 20.

So, John spent 20 hours in total.

He spent 40% of his time sightseeing. 40% of 20 is 0.4 * 20 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"Annabelle already has $80. 

At her first job, she earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours. So, she earns $10 x 20 = $200.

At her second job, she earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours. So, she earns $5 x 15 = $75.

In total, she earns $200 + $75 = $275.

So, she now has $80 + $275 = $355.

The phone costs $400. To find out how much she still needs, we subtract $355 from $400. 

$400 - $355 = $45.

So, Annabelle still needs $45 to buy the phone.

"Let's figure this out. 

The shortest tree is 6 feet tall. The second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so it's 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.

Now, we need to find the total height of the two shorter trees. We add 6 and 11 together, so 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The tallest tree is twice the height of the two shorter trees combined, so we multiply 17 by 2. 17 x 2 = 34 feet.

The tallest tree is 34 feet tall.

"Let's break it down. 

Dean started with $28. 

He bought 6 toy cars for $2 each, so that's 6 x 2 = 12 dollars. 

He bought 5 teddy bears for $1 each, so that's 5 x 1 = 5 dollars. 

So, he spent 12 + 5 = 17 dollars. 

Now, he has 28 - 17 = 11 dollars left. 

His mother gave him an extra $10, so now he has 11 + 10 = 21 dollars.

"Let's break it down. Morgan wants to play mini-golf, which costs $5. She wants to ride the go-karts twice, which costs $10 x 2 = $20. She also wants $5 in arcade tokens. So, the total cost is $5 (mini-golf) + $20 (go-karts) + $5 (arcade tokens) = $30.

Morgan has $90 budgeted for her party. If she spends $30 on the activities, she will have $90 - $30 = $60 left. This $60 will be for her friends. Since each friend will get $60, we need to divide $60 by $60 to find out how many friends she can invite.

60 / 60 = 1 

So, Morgan can invite 1 friend."
"Marisa gets $5 every day. She buys 4 lollipops for 25 cents each. That's 4 x 25 cents = 100 cents or $1. So she saves $5 - $1 = $4 every day.

She saves $4 every day for 5 days. So she saves 4 x 5 = $20.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Billy has $10. He buys candy for $1.5 a pound. Let's say he buys x pounds of candy. The cost of the candy will be 1.5x dollars. 

Since he has $10, the cost of the candy can't be more than $10. So, 1.5x ≤ 10. 

To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the cost of the candy from $10. That's 10 - 1.5x. 

He takes half of this change and spends it on gumballs. Half of the change is (10 - 1.5x) / 2. 

He buys 40 gumballs for $0.05 each. The total cost of the gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2. 

The cost of the gumballs is equal to half of the change. So, (10 - 1.5x) / 2 = 2. 

To find x, we multiply both sides by 2. That's 10 - 1.5x = 4. 

Now, we subtract 10 from both sides. That's -1.5x = -6. 

To find x, we divide both sides by -1.5. That's x = 4. 

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

"Let's figure this out. If Carver is 45 years old and he's 5 years less than twice the age of his son, we can write an equation for it. 

Let's say the son's age is x. 

Carver's age is 5 years less than twice the son's age, so we can write it as: 2x - 5 = 45

Now, we need to solve for x. To do that, we add 5 to both sides of the equation: 2x = 45 + 5

This becomes: 2x = 50

Now, we need to find x. To do that, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 50 / 2

x = 25

So, the son is 25 years old.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to find out how far the train goes in one trip. It goes 75 miles from the first city to the second city, and 100 miles from the second city to the third city. So, the total distance for the first two parts of the trip is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. 

Then, it goes 50 miles less than that combined distance from the third city to the first city. So, it goes 175 - 50 = 125 miles from the third city to the first city. 

Now, we add up all the distances to find the total distance for one trip: 175 + 125 = 300 miles. 

The train does this trip 3 times a day, so it goes 3 x 300 = 900 miles in one day. 

Now, we need to find out how many days it goes between services. The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we need to divide 18,000 by the distance it goes in one day, which is 900 miles. 

18,000 / 900 = 20 

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much stuffing Mark needs, we need to know how much stuffing each kind of bed needs. 

A Rottweiler bed needs 8 pounds of stuffing. A chihuahua bed needs 2 pounds of stuffing. 

A collie bed needs the average amount of stuffing between the first two kinds of beds. To find the average, we add the two numbers and divide by 2. 

8 + 2 = 10. 
10 / 2 = 5. 

So, a collie bed needs 5 pounds of stuffing. 

Now, we need to find out how much stuffing Mark needs to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. 

4 chihuahua beds need 4 x 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing. 

3 collie beds need 3 x 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing. 

In total, Mark needs 8 + 15 = 23 pounds of stuffing.

"To find the time it took for John to drive to his friend's house, we need to use the formula: time = distance / speed. 

First, we need to find the total distance to his friend's house. He had to drive 200 miles, but he took a detour that added 10 miles. So the total distance is 200 + 10 = 210 miles. 

Now we can use the formula to find the time it took to get to his friend's house: time = 210 miles / 70 mph. 

210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours. 

Now, let's find the time it took for John to drive back home. We use the same formula: time = distance / speed. The distance is 240 miles and the speed is 80 mph. 

240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours. 

The total time for the trip is the sum of the time it took to get to his friend's house and the time it took to get back home. 

3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours.

"Let's find out how many girls were at school on Friday. We know there are 43 girls in total and 5 were absent. So, 43 - 5 = 38 girls were at school.

We know there are 96 fourth-graders in total. We already know 38 girls were at school. To find out how many boys were at school, we need to subtract the number of girls from the total number of students. 

96 - 38 = 58

So, there were 58 boys at school on Friday. But we need to find out how many fourth-grade boys were at school. We know 4 fourth-grade boys were absent. So, we need to add the absent boys to the number of boys at school.

58 + 4 = 62

First, 3 customers were kicked out for not wearing masks. 

Then, 4 times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 4 times 3 is 12, and 12 minus 5 is 7. So, 7 people were kicked out for shoplifting.

Next, 3 times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence. 3 times 7 is 21. So, 21 people were kicked out for physical violence.

We know that a total of 50 people were kicked out. We already know that 3 + 7 + 21 is 31. So, 50 minus 31 is 19. 

19 people were kicked out for other reasons.

"First, we need to find out how many seniors are officers. 1/4 of 44 is 11. So, 11 seniors are officers.

Now, we need to find out how much it will cost for the picture frames. Each picture frame costs $20 and the logo etching costs 20% of that. 20% of 20 is 4. So, each picture frame costs $20 + $4 = $24.

Now, we need to find out how much it will cost for the picture frames for all the seniors. 44 seniors need picture frames, so it will cost 44 x $24 = $1056.

Next, we need to find out how much it will cost for the cords for the officers. 11 officers need cords, so it will cost 11 x $12 = $132.

Now, we need to find out how much it will cost for the pins for 2 seniors. 2 x $5 = $10.

On Friday, they sold 14 pairs of shoes. 

On Saturday, they sold double that number, so they sold 14 x 2 = 28 pairs of shoes.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did the day before, so they sold 28 / 2 = 14 pairs of shoes.

Now, let's add up all the pairs of shoes they sold: 14 + 28 + 14 = 56 pairs of shoes.

But, six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit, so we need to subtract those: 56 - 6 = 50 pairs of shoes.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, we need to multiply the number of pairs by 2 to get the total number of shoes: 50 x 2 = 100 shoes.

"To find the amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to find out how much the faulty pieces cost and subtract that from the total amount.

First, we find the cost of the faulty pieces. 40% of $400000 is the cost of the faulty pieces. 

To find 40% of $400000, we multiply 400000 by 0.4 (since 40% is the same as 40/100 or 0.4).

0.4 x 400000 = 160000

So, the faulty pieces cost $160000. 

Now, we subtract the cost of the faulty pieces from the total amount to find the cost of the functioning pieces.

Cost of functioning pieces = Total amount - Cost of faulty pieces

Rate = 10% or 0.10
Time = 5 months

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Interest = $1,825

Now, we need to add the interest to the principal to find the total amount Karan has to pay.
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $3,650 + $1,825

Now, we add up all the bugs: 90 spiders + 30 millipedes + 48 stink bugs = 168.

The final answer is: 168"
"Let's figure this out. 

If Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years older than Erica, then Beth is 30 + 5 = 35 years old.

Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice is 35 + 7 = 42 years old.

To find the difference between Alice and Erica's ages, we need to subtract Erica's age from Alice's age. 

42 (Alice's age) - 30 (Erica's age) = 12

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 12."
"John drinks 2 glasses of milk. Each glass is 8 ounces. So, he drinks 2 x 8 = 16 ounces of milk. Milk has 3 calories per ounce. So, 16 ounces of milk has 16 x 3 = 48 calories.

"To find out how much the builder earns in a year, we need to know how many days he works in a year. 

He works 6 days a week. There are 52 weeks in a year. 

So, he works 6 days/week * 52 weeks/year = 312 days/year.

He gets paid $50 every day. 

So, he earns $50/day * 312 days/year = $15600/year.

"Mark needs 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk for the normal recipe. Since he's making a quadruple batch, he needs 3 x 4 = 12 cups of flour and 1 x 4 = 4 cups of milk.

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs to buy 12 / 2 = 6 bags of flour.

Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, Mark needs to buy 4 / 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

Mark has to buy 6 bags of flour and 2 bottles of milk. To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk he has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles from the number of bags: 6 - 2 = 4.

"To find out how much energy Mel uses each day, we need to multiply the power of the air conditioner by the number of hours it's used. 

Power of the air conditioner = 900 watts
Hours used per day = 8 hours

Energy used per day = Power of the air conditioner * Hours used per day
Energy used per day = 900 watts * 8 hours
Energy used per day = 7200 watt-hours or 7.2 kilowatt-hours (kWh)

Now, if Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, he will use it for 3 hours a day.

New hours used per day = 8 hours - 5 hours
New hours used per day = 3 hours

New energy used per day = Power of the air conditioner * New hours used per day
New energy used per day = 900 watts * 3 hours
New energy used per day = 2700 watt-hours or 2.7 kilowatt-hours (kWh)

Now, we need to find out how much energy Mel will save each day. 

Energy saved per day = Energy used per day - New energy used per day
Energy saved per day = 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh
Energy saved per day = 4.5 kWh

Now, we need to find out how much energy Mel will save in 30 days.

Energy saved in 30 days = Energy saved per day * 30
Energy saved in 30 days = 4.5 kWh * 30
Energy saved in 30 days = 135 kWh

"Let's count the stripes. 

Two zebras have 17 stripes each, so that's 2 x 17 = 34 stripes. 

There's another zebra with 36 stripes. 

And another zebra has half of 36 stripes, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes. 

So, we have 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes in total. 

There are 4 zebras. 

To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras: 88 / 4 = 22.

"To make enough sandwiches for 20 people, we need to know how many sandwiches we need. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide 20 by 4.

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Each sandwich needs 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. So, we need 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The meat costs $7.00 per pound, so 5 pounds of meat will cost 5 x $7.00 = $35.00.

The cheese costs $3.00 per pound, so 5 pounds of cheese will cost 5 x $3.00 = $15.00.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the meat and the cheese.

$35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

The final answer is: $50.00"

Allan has 40 cannolis. He has twice as much corn as cannolis, so he has 2 x 40 = 80 corns.

Then, Allan bought 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. He bought 60 cannolis, so now he has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis. He bought 40 fewer corns than cannolis, so he bought 100 - 40 = 60 corns. 

Now, Allan has 100 cannolis and 80 + 60 = 140 corns. 

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 + 140 = 240.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week and was paid $15 per hour. So, the total amount paid to each employee in May is 40 hours * $15 per hour = $600. 

Since there are 4 weeks in May, the total amount paid to each employee in May is $600 * 4 = $2400. 

Now, the total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 employees * $2400 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 1/4 of 40 is 10 employees. This means 30 employees are left. 

Each employee still works 40 hours a week and is paid $15 per hour. So, the total amount paid to each employee in June is 40 hours * $15 per hour = $600. 

Since there are 4 weeks in June, the total amount paid to each employee in June is $600 * 4 = $2400. 

Now, the total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 employees * $2400 = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

First, Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy. The first pound costs $3. The second pound is half off, so it costs $3 / 2 = $1.50. So the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, she bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50.

Then, she bought 4 magnets for $0.25 each. The total cost of the magnets is 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up all the costs: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10. So, she has $10 - $7 = $3 left.

"First, Tim buys a package of fireworks worth $400 and another pack worth twice that much. Twice of 400 is 400 x 2 = 800. So, the second pack is worth $800. 

Now, we add the cost of both packs together. 400 + 800 = 1200. 

Then, he gets a 20% discount on them. 20% of 1200 is 0.2 x 1200 = 240. 

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost of the packs. 1200 - 240 = 960. 

He also buys a finale firework that costs $150. 

Now, we add the cost of the packs and the finale firework together. 960 + 150 = 1110.

"To find out how many cookies Shannon needs, we need to know how many cookies she eats in 30 days. She eats 2 cookies a night. 

There are 30 days in 30 days, so she eats 2 cookies * 30 days = 60 cookies in 30 days.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen cookies, we need to know how many dozens of cookies she needs. 1 dozen is 12 cookies. 

To find out how many dozens of cookies she needs, we divide the total number of cookies she needs (60) by the number of cookies in a dozen (12). 

60 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5 dozen cookies.

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days.

Now, we know that 5% of the candles that will explode will also smell like wet dog. So, 5% of 500 candles is 0.05 x 500 = 25 candles.

So, 25 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees. Her sister gathers twice as many, so her sister gathers 2 x 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.

Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees. Her sister gathers 3 times as many, so her sister gathers 3 x 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

We know that the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples. Let's say Joanne gathers x apples from the average trees. Then her sister gathers 0 apples from the average trees (since she doesn't take any).

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + x (average) = 45 + x.

The total number of apples gathered by her sister is 60 (tallest) + 45 (shortest) = 105.

Since the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, we can set up the equation: 45 + x + 105 = 500.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 150 + x = 500.

Subtracting 150 from both sides, we get: x = 350.

The final answer is: 350"
"Let's think about it. We have 304 bumps and we know that dromedaries have one hump and camels have two humps. So, if we let x be the number of dromedaries and y be the number of camels, we can make an equation. 

We know that x + y = 180 (because there are 180 heads) and x + 2y = 304 (because there are 304 bumps). 

We can solve the first equation for x: x = 180 - y.

Now, we can plug this into the second equation: (180 - y) + 2y = 304.

Combine like terms: 180 + y = 304.

Subtract 180 from both sides: y = 124.

Now that we know y, we can find x: x = 180 - y = 180 - 124 = 56.

So, there are 56 dromedaries.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day for 4 days. So, he traveled 200 x 4 = 800 kilometers in the first 4 days.

Then, he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 is 0.3 x 800 = 240 kilometers. So, he traveled 240 kilometers over the next two days.

Now, let's add the distance he traveled in the first 4 days and the next 2 days. 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers.

On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so we don't need to add anything.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. There are 7 days in a week, so he traveled 300 x 7 = 2100 kilometers in the second week.

Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. This means if Zack's locker is x/2, Peter's locker is (x/2)/4. 

We know Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches. So, (x/2)/4 = 5. 

To solve for x, we need to multiply both sides by 4 and then multiply both sides by 2. 

(x/2)/4 * 4 = 5 * 4 
x/2 = 20 

x/2 * 2 = 20 * 2

Let's say the total savings from the jogger jeans is x. Then, the total savings from the jogger jeans is 1/3 of the total savings, so x = 1/3 * 6 = 2.

The total savings from the jogger jeans is $2, so the savings from the tattered jeans is 2/3 * 6 = 4.

"Ray had 25 lollipops. He kept 5 lollipops. So, he had 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops left. He shared the lollipops with his 4 friends. To find out how many lollipops each friend got, we need to divide 20 by 4.

20 ÷ 4 = 5

So, each of his friends received 5 lollipops.

"Rory cuts the cake into 8 pieces. If she and her mom each have a piece, that means 2 pieces are taken. 

So, there are 8 - 2 = 6 pieces left.

Each piece is the same size, and the whole cake weighs 20 ounces. To find out how much one piece weighs, we divide 20 by 8.

20 / 8 = 2.5 ounces per piece.

Now, we need to find out how much 6 pieces weigh. We multiply 6 by 2.5.

6 x 2.5 = 15

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we need to add the oranges Sitti and Juris have together. 

34 (Sitti's oranges) + 22 (Juris' oranges) = 56 oranges

Then, we need to find out how many people will be sharing the oranges. Sitti and Juris will share the oranges with their 6 friends, so there are 2 (Sitti and Juris) + 6 (friends) = 8 people in total.

Now, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the number of people. 

56 oranges / 8 people = 7 oranges per person

So, everyone will get 7 oranges.

"Antoine wants to use 2 pounds of onions, but he wants to double that. So, he needs 2 x 2 = 4 pounds of onions. 

The onions cost $2.00 a pound, so 4 pounds will cost 4 x $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00. So, 2 boxes will cost 2 x $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we need to divide the total cost by 6. 

$12.00 ÷ 6 = $2.00

The cost per serving is $2.00."
"Let's break it down. 

Wayne is staying close to the theater, so it takes him 4 minutes to get there. Bernadette is staying far away, so it takes her 4 times as long as Wayne, which is 4 x 4 = 16 minutes.

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. So, Bernadette needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne. Since it takes Bernadette 16 minutes to get to the theater, she needs to leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before the premiere starts.

Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, he needs to leave 4 minutes before the premiere starts. 

So, Bernadette needs to leave 21 - 4 = 17 minutes before Wayne to get to the theater first.

"I don't know what yards are. My teacher said we use feet for rooms. If the area is 360 square feet and the length is 3 feet, I need to find the width. 

Area is length times width. So, width is area divided by length. 

360 / 3 = 120 feet. 

Now I know the width is 120 feet. The perimeter is the sum of all sides. Since it's a rectangle, I need to add the length and width, and then multiply by 2. 

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width) 
Perimeter = 2 * (3 + 120) 
Perimeter = 2 * 123 
Perimeter = 246

"Let's count the beads Elizabeth has. She bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. So, she has 1 x 20 + 2 x 20 = 60 beads. 

Now, let's count the beads Margareth has. She bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. So, she has 3 x 20 + 4 x 20 = 100 beads.

Now, let's find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth. Margareth has 100 beads and Elizabeth has 60 beads. So, Margareth has 100 - 60 = 40 more beads than Elizabeth.

"So, Marcus's house is 40 degrees. He bakes for 3 hours. Every hour, the temperature goes up by 5 degrees. So, 3 hours is 3 x 5 = 15 degrees. Now, the house is 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.

Then, Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes. The window cools down the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes. So, 30 minutes is 3 sets of 10 minutes. That means the house cools down 3 x 2 = 6 degrees.

Now, we need to subtract 6 from 55. 55 - 6 = 49.

The final answer is: 49"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Jon's total time is 40 minutes for the swim, 80 minutes for the bike ride, and 50 minutes for the run. So, Jon's total time is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes.

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. 10% of 40 minutes is 4 minutes. So, James finishes the swim in 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. Jon takes 80 minutes, so James takes 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, we know that Jon won by 10 minutes. This means that James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time. So, James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

We already know that James takes 36 minutes for the swim and 85 minutes for the bike ride. So, the time James takes for the run is 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Movie C is 1.25 hours. We need to convert this to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour. 

1.25 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 75 minutes

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. To find one-fourth of Movie B, we need to divide the length of Movie B by 4.

80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

"First, we need to find out how many miles the horse ran. The horse ran for 30 minutes, and we need to convert this to hours because the speed is in miles per hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 30 minutes is 30/60 = 0.5 hours.

Now, we multiply the speed by the time to find the distance. Distance = speed * time = 32 * 0.5 = 16 miles.

The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, so for 16 miles, it will eat 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so 8 bails will cost 8 * 3 = $24.

Michael has six 5 dollar bills, which is 6 * 5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the cost of the hay from the money Michael has. Change = $30 - $24 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"Rozanne uses 4 dozen eggs. 1 dozen is 12 eggs, so 4 dozen is 4 x 12 = 48 eggs. She also uses 2 more eggs. So, she uses 48 + 2 = 50 eggs in total.

Each glass needs 5 eggs, so we need to divide the total number of eggs by 5 to find out how many glasses she can make. 50 ÷ 5 = 10 glasses.

Each tray holds 5 glasses, so we need to divide the number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays she can put out. 10 ÷ 5 = 2 trays.

Marcy has 225 points. She scores 10 points. So, Marcy now has 225 + 10 = 235 points.

To find out how many points Joey is winning by, we need to subtract Marcy's points from Joey's points. 

240 (Joey's points) - 235 (Marcy's points) = 5

So, Joey is winning by 5 points.

The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576. 

He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each on Monday. So, he made 17 x 20 = 340 dollars from the sale on Monday.

He sold the rest of the sneakers, which is 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers, for $25 each. So, he made 31 x 25 = 775 dollars from the rest of the sales.

In total, he made 340 + 775 = 1115 dollars from selling the sneakers.

To find the profit, we need to subtract the cost from the total earnings. The cost was $576. So, the profit is 1115 - 576 = 539 dollars.

The final answer is: $539"

I already paid $12 for the regular ticket, so the cost of popcorn and soda is $19 - $12 = $7.

The soda costs $3, so the cost of popcorn is $7 - $3 = $4.

The regular price of popcorn is $4. 

The final answer is: $4"

First, we know that 20 balloons cost $900. To find out how much one balloon costs, we need to divide $900 by 20. 

$900 ÷ 20 = $45 per balloon.

Now, we know that the price of each balloon increased by $20. So, the new price of each balloon is $45 + $20 = $65.

Bentley wants to fill 170 balloons. To find out how much he paid, we need to multiply the new price of each balloon by the number of balloons. 

$65 x 170 = $11,050.

The final answer is: $11,050"
"To find the average speed, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken. 

First, let's find the distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours. Distance = speed * time = 60 * 2 = 120 miles.

Then, let's find the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour. Distance = speed * time = 30 * 1 = 30 miles.

Now, we add the two distances together to get the total distance. Total distance = 120 + 30 = 150 miles.

Next, we add the two times together to get the total time. Total time = 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Now, we divide the total distance by the total time to get the average speed. Average speed = total distance / total time = 150 / 3 = 50 mph.

Now, we need to find out how much money the sapphires are worth. 5 sapphires are worth 5 x $800 = $4000.

Now, we add the money from the rubies and the sapphires. $2400 + $4000 = $6400.

"To find out how much potting soil Bob needs, we need to find out how many cubic feet of soil he needs. 

First, we need to find the volume of one raised bed. The formula for volume is length x width x height. 

Length = 8 feet
Width = 2 feet
Height = 2 feet

Volume of one bed = 8 x 2 x 2 = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, we need to multiply the volume of one bed by 10.

Total volume = 32 x 10 = 320 cubic feet

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. To find out how many bags Bob needs, we need to divide the total volume by 2.

Number of bags = 320 / 2 = 160

Each bag costs $12. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag.

Total cost = 160 x 12 = 1920

The final answer is: $1920"

First, we know there are 15 red cards. Then, there are 60% more green cards than red cards. To find 60% of 15, we multiply 15 by 0.6. 

15 * 0.6 = 9

So, there are 60% more green cards than red cards, which means there are 15 + 9 = 24 green cards.

Now, we know that yellow cards are as many as the sum of red and green cards. So, the number of yellow cards is 15 + 24 = 39.

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards together. 

15 (red) + 24 (green) + 39 (yellow) = 78

Now, we need to find the percentage of puppies with spots. To do that, we divide the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100.

(7 / 20) * 100 = 35

The answer is: 35"
"To find out how many trips the farmer needs, we need to know how much feed he bought in total. 

First, let's find out how much sugar cubes he bought: 2 boxes * 1 pound = 2 pounds.

Next, let's find out how much carrots he bought: 4 bags * 12 pounds = 48 pounds.

Then, let's find out how much hay he bought: 42 bales * 75 pounds = 3150 pounds.

Lastly, let's find out how much oats he bought: 20 sacks * 65 pounds = 1300 pounds.

Now, let's add up all the feed: 2 pounds + 48 pounds + 3150 pounds + 1300 pounds = 3400 pounds.

Since the farmer's truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight of the feed by the weight the truck can carry: 3400 pounds / 2250 pounds = 1.51.

Since we can't make a fraction of a trip, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. So, the farmer needs 2 trips."
"Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week. That's 3 cans * 2 cents = 6 cents a week from aluminum cans. 

Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week. That's 5 bottles * 3 cents = 15 cents a week from plastic bottles.

So, Grayson earns 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents a week from recycling.

In a four-week month, Grayson earns 21 cents * 4 = 84 cents.

"Let's figure this out step by step. 

First, we know Frederick has 10 plants. 

Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. To find 60% of 10, we multiply 10 by 0.6. 

10 x 0.6 = 6

So, Toni has 10 + 6 = 16 plants.

Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. To find out how many plants Shondra has, we subtract 7 from Toni's plants.

16 - 7 = 9

So, Shondra has 9 plants.

"Leila gave Ali half of her money, so we need to find half of 100. Half of 100 is 50. 

Ali had 21 dollars and Leila gave him 50 dollars. To find out how much Ali has now, we need to add 21 and 50. 

21 + 50 = 71

So, Ali has 71 dollars now."
"To find the tip, we need to find 1/5 of the cost of the pizza. 

1/5 of $15 is the same as $15 divided by 5. 

$15 divided by 5 is $3.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Miss Maria has 6 decks of basketball cards, and each deck has 25 cards. So, she has 6 x 25 = 150 basketball cards.

She also has 5 boxes of baseball cards, and each box has 40 cards. So, she has 5 x 40 = 200 baseball cards.

Now, she has a total of 150 basketball cards + 200 baseball cards = 350 cards.

She keeps 50 cards for herself, so she gives the remaining cards to her students. The remaining cards are 350 - 50 = 300 cards.

Each student gets 10 cards, so we need to divide the remaining cards by 10 to find out how many students she has. 300 ÷ 10 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each. So, she paid 20 x 45 cents = 900 cents. 

Since 100 cents is 1 dollar, 900 cents is 9 dollars. 

Becky got a $1 discount, so she paid 9 - 1 = 8 dollars.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each. So, she paid 20 x 50 cents = 1000 cents. 

Since 100 cents is 1 dollar, 1000 cents is 10 dollars. 

Kelly got a 10 percent discount. 10 percent of 10 dollars is 1 dollar. So, Kelly paid 10 - 1 = 9 dollars.

Kelly paid 9 dollars and Becky paid 8 dollars. So, Kelly paid 9 - 8 = 1 dollar more than Becky.

Each room has 2 sheets. 
Each room has 1 comforter. 
Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 pillow cases. 
Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so that's 2 x 4 = 8 towels. 

So, each room has 2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15 pieces of laundry. 

Now, we have 80 rooms. To find the total number of pieces of laundry, we multiply the number of pieces per room by the number of rooms: 15 x 80 = 1200.

"Let's count the shoes Fireman Frank gets. He gets 5 pairs on Monday, that's 5 x 2 = 10 shoes. Then he gets 15 pairs on Wednesday, that's 15 x 2 = 30 shoes. And he gets 30 pairs on Friday, that's 30 x 2 = 60 shoes. 

Now, let's add all the shoes he got: 10 + 30 + 60 = 100 shoes. 

Fireman Frank already had 200 shoes. Now he has 200 + 100 = 300 shoes. 

But on Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. So, we need to subtract 180 from 300: 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

The answer is 120."

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we find out how many pencils were used in the first two months. There are 30 students and each student started with 10 pencils. So, the total number of pencils is 30 x 10 = 300.

1/5 of the pencils were used, so we need to find 1/5 of 300. To do that, we multiply 300 by 1 and divide by 5. 300 x 1 = 300, and 300 / 5 = 60. So, 60 pencils were used.

Now, we need to find out how many pencils were left after two months. We started with 300 pencils and 60 were used, so 300 - 60 = 240 pencils were left.

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. We need to find 1/3 of 240. To do that, we multiply 240 by 1 and divide by 3. 240 x 1 = 240, and 240 / 3 = 80.

So, the answer is 80."

The answer is 6."
"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to multiply the number of remoras by their length. There are 2 remoras, and each one is 6 inches long. 

2 remoras * 6 inches = 12 inches

Now, we need to convert the shark's length to inches because the remoras' length is in inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot. 

10 feet * 12 inches/foot = 120 inches

Now, we need to find what percentage 12 inches is of 120 inches. 

(12 inches / 120 inches) * 100 = 10%

If one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer, then 20 students is one-fourth of the total number of students. To find the total number of students, we need to multiply 20 by 4.

20 * 4 = 80

So, there are 80 students at that grade level."
"To find out how long Jason has to walk each day, we need to know how many days he has to walk in total. He wants to break in the shoes in three weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so three weeks is 3 x 7 = 21 days.

He can walk 4 days a week, so in 21 days, he can walk 21 / 7 = 3 weeks * 4 days a week = 12 days. 

Now we know he has 12 days to break in the shoes. He needs to walk 240 minutes in total. To find out how many minutes he needs to walk each day, we divide 240 minutes by 12 days. 

240 / 12 = 20 minutes.

To find 3/4 of 48, we need to multiply 48 by 3 and then divide by 4. 

48 * 3 = 144
144 / 4 = 36

So the 2010 penny weighs 36 grains. Now, we need to find the combined weight of the two pennies. We add the weight of the 1959 penny and the 2010 penny.

The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, so the farm has 30 + 10 = 40 animals. The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, so the zoo has 60 + 20 = 80 animals.

The farm and zoo have 40 + 80 = 120 animals combined.

"Let's say Sophia bought x onions and y potatoes. We know that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. So, Rose bought 4x onions and 4y potatoes.

We also know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. This means 4x = 12 and 4y = 4.

To find x, we divide both sides of the equation 4x = 12 by 4. This gives us x = 3. 

To find y, we divide both sides of the equation 4y = 4 by 4. This gives us y = 1.

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. 

3 + 1 = 4"
"To find out how many days Andy has to lose the weight, we need to count the days from December 31st to July 19th. 

December has 31 days, January has 31 days, February has 28 days (since it's not a leap year), March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and July has 19 days. 

31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 201 days

Now, we need to find out how many calories Andy needs to burn in total. He wants to lose 30 pounds and needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound. 

30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories

Now, we need to find out how many calories he needs to burn each day. 

105,000 calories / 201 days = 520 calories per day

So, Andy needs to have a calorie deficit of 520 calories per day to reach his goal."
"Gerald gets $30 every day. He worked for a week, which is 7 days. So, he got 30 x 7 = 210 dollars. He spent 100 dollars. To find out how much he has left, we need to subtract 100 from 210. 

210 - 100 = 110

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Julie had $500. She spent 20% of it on clothes. 

20% of 500 is 0.2 x 500 = 100. 

So, she spent $100 on clothes. Now, she has 500 - 100 = 400 dollars left.

Then, she spent 25% of the remaining money on CDs. 

25% of 400 is 0.25 x 400 = 100.

So, she spent $100 on CDs. Now, she has 400 - 100 = 300 dollars left.

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's say the lot cost x dollars. Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the house cost 3x dollars. The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. So, we can write an equation: x + 3x = 120,000. 

Combine like terms: 4x = 120,000. 

Divide both sides by 4: x = 30,000. 

So, the lot cost $30,000. Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the house cost 3 * 30,000 = 90,000.

The house cost $90,000."
"Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags. That means she bought 8 x 5 = 40 bags.

She bought 40 bags for $4 each, so she spent 40 x 4 = $160.

She sold each bag for $8. So, she sold 40 bags for 40 x 8 = $320.

To find the profit, we need to subtract the cost from the selling price. So, the profit is 320 - 160 = $160.

The final answer is: $160"

40 + 120 = 160 (total money)

Ali gives his sister half of the total money. Half of 160 is 160 / 2 = 80. 

Now, Ali has 160 - 80 = 80 dollars left. 

Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining money to buy dinner. 3/5 of 80 is 3/5 x 80 = 48.

For a hat, it takes 2 skeins. Since there are 3 grandchildren, she needs 2 * 3 = 6 skeins for hats.

For a scarf, it takes 4 skeins. Since there are 3 grandchildren, she needs 4 * 3 = 12 skeins for scarves.

For a sweater, it takes 12 skeins. Since there are 3 grandchildren, she needs 12 * 3 = 36 skeins for sweaters.

For mittens, it takes 1 skein per pair. Since there are 3 grandchildren, she needs 1 * 3 = 3 skeins for mittens. But she needs 2 pairs of mittens for each grandchild, so she needs 3 * 2 = 6 skeins for mittens.

For socks, it takes 2 skeins per pair. Since there are 3 grandchildren, she needs 2 * 3 = 6 skeins for socks. But she needs 2 pairs of socks for each grandchild, so she needs 6 * 2 = 12 skeins for socks.

Now, let's add up all the skeins of wool needed: 6 (hats) + 12 (scarves) + 36 (sweaters) + 6 (mittens) + 12 (socks) = 72 skeins.

27 ÷ 3 = 9

Now, we know each part will have 9 cups of raisins. A batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide 9 by 3/4.

To divide 9 by 3/4, we can multiply 9 by 4 and then divide by 3.

Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. If a kilowatt per hour is $1.50, then her daily bill is 12 x $1.50 = $18.

Now, let's find out her daily bill after she adds the new device. The new device will consume 2 kilowatts per hour a day. So, her new daily consumption will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour. Her new daily bill will be 14 x $1.50 = $21.

Now, we need to find out her weekly bill before and after she adds the new device. There are 7 days in a week. So, her weekly bill before the new device is $18 x 7 = $126. Her weekly bill after the new device is $21 x 7 = $147.

"Let's break it down. Josh spent 4 hours working out every week except for some occasions. He spent 5 hours for 2 weeks, and 6 hours for 1 week. 

First, let's find out how many weeks he spent 4 hours. There are 8 weeks in total, and he spent 5 hours for 2 weeks and 6 hours for 1 week. So, 2 + 1 = 3 weeks. That means he spent 4 hours for 8 - 3 = 5 weeks.

Now, let's calculate the total hours he spent working out. For the 5 weeks he spent 4 hours, that's 5 x 4 = 20 hours. For the 2 weeks he spent 5 hours, that's 2 x 5 = 10 hours. And for the 1 week he spent 6 hours, that's 1 x 6 = 6 hours.

There are 48 people on the bus initially. 

At the first stop, 8 people get off. So, there are 48 - 8 = 40 people left on the bus.

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get into the bus. 5 times 8 is 40. So, 40 people get in. Now, there are 40 + 40 = 80 people on the bus.

At the second stop, 21 people get off. So, there are 80 - 21 = 59 people left on the bus.

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. 3 times 21 is 63, but 3 times fewer means 21 - 63 = -42. But you can't have a negative number of people getting on the bus, so it means 3 times fewer is 63 - 21 = 42 fewer. So, 21 - 42 = -21 people get on. But again, you can't have a negative number of people getting on the bus. This means 3 times fewer is actually 21 - (21/3) = 21 - 7 = 14 fewer. So, 21 - 14 = 7 people get on the bus.

Now, there are 59 + 7 = 66 people on the bus.

Jame will turn 27 in 5 years. This means that Jame's age in 5 years will be 27. To find Jame's current age, we need to subtract 5 from 27. 

Jame's current age = 27 - 5 = 22.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. Let's first find Jame's age in 8 years. 

Jame's age in 8 years = 22 + 8 = 30.

Now, we need to find Jame's cousin's age in 8 years. It will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age in 8 years. 

Twice Jame's age in 8 years = 2 * 30 = 60.

Jame's cousin's age in 8 years = 60 - 5 = 55.

Now, we need to find Jame's cousin's current age. We know that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 55. So, we subtract 8 from 55 to find the current age.

Jame's cousin's current age = 55 - 8 = 47.

Now, we need to find the difference between Jame's current age and his cousin's current age.

Difference in age = Jame's current age - Jame's cousin's current age = 22 - 47 = -25.

The negative sign means that Jame's cousin is younger than Jame."
"Let's break it down. 

Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer. The computer cost $1,100. So, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Errol spent $2,400 in total. The computer cost $1,100 and the printer cost $700. So, the total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800.

To find the cost of the monitors, we need to subtract the cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost. $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

Since there are 2 monitors, we need to divide the cost of the monitors by 2 to find the cost of one monitor. $600 / 2 = $300.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + 4 x 60 shells.

First, we need to find out how many shells the girls brought in total. 4 x 60 is 240. So, the girls brought 600 + 240 = 840 shells in total.

Since there are 10 girls, we need to find out how many shells each girl brought. To do this, we divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by the number of girls. 840 ÷ 10 = 84.

Elvis wants to save $1125 in total. He wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half. 

Let's say he saves x dollars in the first half. Then, he will save 2x dollars in the second half. 

The total amount he will save is x + 2x = 3x. 

Since he wants to save $1125, we can set up the equation: 3x = 1125.

To find x, we need to divide both sides by 3: x = 1125 / 3 = 375.

So, he saves 375 dollars in the first half. 

Now, we need to find out how much he saves in the second half. We know it's 2x, so 2 * 375 = 750.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30

The shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items. To find the discount, we need to calculate 10% of $30:
10% of $30 = 0.1 x $30 = $3

To find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day, we multiply 16 minutes by 3. 16 x 3 = 48 minutes.

To find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a warm day, we multiply 34 minutes by 3. 34 x 3 = 102 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day. We subtract the time it takes on a cold day from the time it takes on a hot day. 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

The final answer is: 54"
"John gets paid $2 per hour and he works 5 hours a day. So, he gets $2 x 5 = $10 per day. 

He works 4 days a week, so he gets $10 x 4 = $40 per week.

To find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we need to divide $80 by $40. 

$80 ÷ $40 = 2

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80."
"I like Subway. They have yummy food. 

Okay, so I pay $40 for a foot-long fish sub. That's a big sub. Then I pay thrice as much for a six-inch cold-cut combo sub. Thrice means 3 times. So, I pay 3 times $40 for the six-inch sub. 

3 times $40 is $120. So, I pay $40 for the foot-long fish sub and $120 for the six-inch cold-cut combo sub. 

To find the total cost, I need to add $40 and $120. 

$40 + $120 = $160

"Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee. If we don't know the daily recommended cups, we can call it x. So, Octavia drinks x/2 cups.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks. So, Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups.

The doctor asked Juan to drink 4 cups of coffee. To find out how many cups Juan must reduce, we need to subtract 4 from the amount he currently drinks. 

5x - 4 = ?

We don't know the value of x, but we can still find the difference. The question asks by how many cups Juan must reduce his coffee intake. This is the difference between what he drinks now and what he should drink. 

5x - 4 is the difference, but we don't know x. However, we can say that the difference is 5x - 4 cups.

To find the answer, we need to know the value of x. But the question doesn't give us that information."

Mark weighs 150 pounds. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 x 130 = 260 pounds.

Now we need to find the average weight of the 3 friends. To do that, we need to add their weights together and divide by 3.

Their total weight is 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.

The average weight is 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.

"To find the final position of the sun, we need to add the angle of the pyramid to the angle the sun moves. 

The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, so it's already at the same angle as the pyramid, which is 32 degrees. 

The sun moves 5 degrees an hour for 10 hours, so we need to multiply 5 degrees by 10 hours to find the total angle it moves. 

5 degrees * 10 hours = 50 degrees

Now, we add the angle the sun moves to the angle of the pyramid. 

32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees

So, the final position of the sun will be 82 degrees from the ground.

If 1 contact lasts 1/60 of a month, then 1 pair will last 1/30 of a month. 

Since 1 pair will last 1/30 of a month, then 1 pair will be used 30 times in a month. 

If 1 box has 90 contacts, then 2 boxes will have 180 contacts. 

180 contacts will last 30 * 2 = 60 months. 

Since 1 box costs $100 and there's a 10% discount, the cost of 1 box will be $100 - ($100 * 0.1) = $90.

Since there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of red jelly beans is x - (1% of x) = x - 0.01x = 0.99x.

Since there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of green jelly beans is x + (1% of x) = x + 0.01x = 1.01x.

The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation: x + 0.99x + 1.01x = 4500.

Combine like terms: 3.99x = 4500.

Divide both sides by 3.99: x = 4500 / 3.99 = 1125.

Now we know the number of blue jelly beans is 1125. 

The number of red jelly beans is 0.99x = 0.99 * 1125 = 1112.5.

The number of green jelly beans is 1.01x = 1.01 * 1125 = 1137.5.

Now, we know that he is 2x years old now. To find out how old he will be in 3 years, we need to add 3 to 2x. So, he will be 2x + 3 years old in 3 years.

But we still don't know what x is. Let's think about it. If he was x years old 5 years ago and now he is 2x years old, that means 5 years have passed. So, 5 years ago, he was x years old, and now he is 2x years old. 

Let's try to find out what x is. We can do this by using a simple equation. If he was x years old 5 years ago and now he is 2x years old, then 2x - x = 5. This is because 2x is his current age and x is his age 5 years ago. 

2x - x = 5
x = 5

Now that we know x is 5, we can find out how old he will be in 3 years. We know that he will be 2x + 3 years old in 3 years.

We know that the three angles add up to 180 degrees. So, we can write an equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180.

Combine like terms: 6x = 180.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 30.

Now we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are 2x = 60 degrees and 3x = 90 degrees.

The largest angle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"Let's count the money Colby has. 

8 quarters are worth 8 x 25 cents = 200 cents. 
6 dimes are worth 6 x 10 cents = 60 cents. 
14 nickels are worth 14 x 5 cents = 70 cents. 
15 pennies are worth 15 x 1 cent = 15 cents.

Now, let's add all the money together. 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents. 

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can convert 345 cents to dollars by dividing by 100. 345 ÷ 100 = 3.45 dollars.

Gumballs cost a nickel each, which is 5 cents. To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to divide the money he has by the cost of one gumball. 3.45 ÷ 0.05 = 69.

The final answer is: 69"
"Let's count the legs of each pet. Dogs have 4 legs, cats have 4 legs, and birds have 2 legs. 

There are 5 dogs, so they have 5 x 4 = 20 legs. 
There are 2 cats, so they have 2 x 4 = 8 legs. 
There are 10 birds, so they have 10 x 2 = 20 legs. 

Now, let's add all the legs together: 20 + 8 + 20 = 48. 

The final answer is: 48"
"Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight. He increases it by 50%. To find 50% of 8, I need to multiply 8 by 0.5. 8 x 0.5 = 4. Then I add 4 to 8. 8 + 4 = 12. 

Now, he uses a weight two pounds lighter than 12. To find that, I need to subtract 2 from 12. 12 - 2 = 10.

The weight he now uses is 10 pounds."
"Steve gets 5 games for his birthday. 

In the first year, he buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so that's 1 x 12 = 12 games. He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so that's 5 + 12 = 17 games. 

In the second year, he buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so that's 2 x 12 = 24 games. He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so that's 24 + 5 = 29 games. 

In the third year, he buys 4 games per month for 12 months, so that's 4 x 12 = 48 games. He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so that's 48 + 5 = 53 games. 

Now, we add up all the games he got: 17 + 29 + 53 = 99 games. 

So, Steve has 99 games."
"To find out how many hours it takes to travel 2000 miles, we need to know the plane's speed. We can find the speed by dividing the distance it traveled by the time it took. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Speed = 400 miles per hour

Now, we need to find out how many hours it takes to travel 2000 miles at 400 miles per hour. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

So, it would take 5 hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. So, in 1 hour, Ruiz can make 120 / 2 = 60 pounds of chocolates.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours. So, Marissa makes 3/4 * 120 = 90 pounds of chocolates in an hour.

Now, let's find out how much they make in 1 hour together. Ruiz makes 60 pounds and Marissa makes 90 pounds, so together they make 60 + 90 = 150 pounds in 1 hour.

If they worked for 12 hours in a day, they will make 150 * 12 = 1800 pounds of chocolates together.

The final answer is: 1800"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

On Monday, Howard spends $8. 
On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as Monday, so he spends 2 x 8 = 16 dollars. 
On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as Tuesday, so he spends 4 x 16 = 64 dollars. 

Now, let's add up how much he spent in total: 8 + 16 + 64 = 88 dollars. 

He originally had $100, so to find out how much he has left, we need to subtract how much he spent from the original amount: 100 - 88 = 12 dollars.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break it down. 

First, Patrick sold lemonade for 4 hours at $0.50 per cup. He sold 15 cups per hour. So, he sold 15 x 4 = 60 cups. 

60 cups at $0.50 per cup is 60 x 0.50 = $30.

Then, Patrick sold lemonade for 2 hours at $0.60 per cup. He sold 10 cups per hour. So, he sold 10 x 2 = 20 cups.

20 cups at $0.60 per cup is 20 x 0.60 = $12.

Now, we add the money he made from both parts. $30 + $12 = $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"To find out how many times the tires rotate in a month, we need to multiply the number of miles driven in a month by the number of rotations per mile. 

400 miles/month * 725 rotations/mile = 290,000 rotations/month

Now, we need to find out how many months the tires can last. 

10,440,000 rotations / 290,000 rotations/month = 36 months

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find out how many years the tires can last by dividing the number of months by 12.

36 months / 12 months/year = 3 years

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how much each pump costs, we need to know how many pumps are in the bottle and how much the bottle costs. 

The bottle costs $24.00. We need to convert this to cents. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so we multiply 24 by 100.

24 x 100 = 2400 cents

The bottle costs 2400 cents. 

The bottle will give 120 washings with 2 pumps. So, we need to find out how many pumps are in the bottle. 

2 pumps per 120 washings means 2 pumps / 120 washings = 1 pump / 60 washings. 

There are 60 pumps in the bottle. 

Now, we need to find out how much each pump costs. 

The bottle costs 2400 cents and there are 60 pumps in the bottle. 

2400 cents / 60 pumps = 40 cents per pump.

The answer is 40."
"To find out how much money Joe will have left, we need to first find out how much he will pay for the outfit. 

The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35. 

First, we add the price of the shirt and the shorts together: $25 + $35 = $60.

There's a 30% off sale, so we need to find 30% of $60. To do that, we multiply $60 by 0.3 (which is the same as 30%): $60 * 0.3 = $18.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total price: $60 - $18 = $42.

So, Joe will pay $42 for the outfit.

Joe started with $50, so we need to subtract the price of the outfit from that: $50 - $42 = $8.

Joe will have $8 left after the purchase.

The final answer is: $8"
"To find out how much butter Juan needs, we need to know how many croissants he's making and how much butter each one needs. 

He's making 4 dozen croissants a day. 1 dozen is 12, so 4 dozen is 4 x 12 = 48 croissants.

Each croissant needs 1/4 pound of butter. To find out how much butter 48 croissants need, we multiply 48 by 1/4. 

48 x 1/4 is the same as 48 / 4. 48 / 4 is 12.

So, Juan needs 12 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day.

"To find out how much it costs to repave Lewis' street, we need to multiply the cost per meter by the length of his street. 

Cost per meter is $194. 
Length of Lewis' street is 490 meters.

So, we multiply 194 by 490.

194 x 490 = 95,060

Now, we need to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street. 

Monica's street is 150 meters long. 

We need to multiply 194 by 150 to find out how much it costs to repave Monica's street.

194 x 150 = 29,100

Now, we subtract the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street.

95,060 - 29,100 = 65,960

The answer is 65960."
"John gets $100,000 for the first 5 months. Then it takes 10 times as long, so 5 x 10 = 50 months. That's 50 months after the first 5 months, so 55 months total. 

The first 5 months cost $100,000. After that, it costs 50% more each month. 50% of $100,000 is $50,000. So it costs $100,000 + $50,000 = $150,000 for each of the 50 months. 

$150,000 x 50 = $7,500,000. 

$100,000 + $7,500,000 = $7,600,000.

The final answer is: $7,600,000"
"The first player ate a 6-ounce steak. 

The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so that's 8 ounces. 

The third player ate a one-pound steak.  One pound is 16 ounces.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, Scarlett found the aquarium for $10.00. 

Then, she bought 2 bags of rocks for $2.50 each. That's 2 x $2.50 = $5.00.

Next, she bought 3 pieces of coral for $2.00 each. That's 3 x $2.00 = $6.00.

After that, she bought 20 fish for $0.50 each. That's 20 x $0.50 = $10.00.

Lastly, she bought fish food for $2.00.

Now, let's add up all the costs: $10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00.

So, Scarlett spent $33.00."
"So, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall after the first week. Then it doubled in the second week, so it's 3 x 2 = 6 inches tall. 

In the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so we add 4 to 6, which is 6 + 4 = 10 inches. 

The beanstalk is 10 inches tall after 3 weeks.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we find out how many seats were occupied by the administrators. There are 4 rows with 18 seats each, so the total number of seats is 4 x 18 = 72. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, so that's 72 / 4 = 18 seats.

Now, we subtract the seats occupied by the administrators from the total number of seats. 72 - 18 = 54 seats.

Next, we find out how many seats were occupied by the parents. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents, so that's 54 / 3 = 18 seats.

Now, we subtract the seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats. 54 - 18 = 36 seats.

The rest of the seats were occupied by the students. So, there were 36 students in the school auditorium.

The second DVD has been played 135 times. It can be played 1000 times before it breaks. So, it can be played 1000 - 135 = 865 more times.

Now, we add the number of times each DVD can be played: 644 + 865 = 1509.

So, both DVDs can be played 1509 times before they break."
"Let's figure this out. John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks. He went twice a week, so that's 2 times a week. We multiply 2 times 6 to get 12. That means he went 12 times. Each time he went for 2 hours. So, we multiply 12 times 2 to get 24 hours. 

Now, we know each hour costs $125. So, we multiply 24 hours by $125. That's 24 times 125. 

24 x 100 = 2400
24 x 20 = 480
24 x 5 = 120

Now we add 2400 + 480 + 120. That's 3000.

Ashley's internet connection speed is 20 kb per second. To find out how many kb she can download in one hour, we multiply her speed by the number of seconds in one hour: 20 kb/second x 3600 seconds = 72,000 kb.

Now, we need to convert kb to Mb. We know that 1 Mb has 1000 kb. So, to find out how many Mb Ashley can download in one hour, we divide the total kb by 1000: 72,000 kb / 1000 = 72 Mb.

So, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour.

The company paid 30% of $25,000 to acquire the cars. 30% of $25,000 is 0.3 x $25,000 = $7,500. So, James got $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500 for each car.

James sold 10 cars for $17,500 each. So, he made 10 x $17,500 = $175,000.

He got a 10% commission on the profits. 10% of $175,000 is 0.1 x $175,000 = $17,500.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that 25% of the riders can stay upright on the wave. Since there are 100 riders, we can find 25% of 100 by multiplying 100 by 0.25. 

25% of 100 is 0.25 x 100 = 25 riders who can stay upright.

Now, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women. To find the number of women, we multiply 25 by 0.6.

0.6 x 25 = 15 women who can stay upright.

Since there are 25 riders in total who can stay upright, and 15 of them are women, the number of men who can stay upright is 25 - 15.

Volume = 6 x 4 x 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Now, we know it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth. To find out how long it will take him to shovel 72 cubic feet, we multiply the volume by the time it takes to shovel 1 cubic foot.

Time = Volume x Time per cubic foot
Time = 72 x 3

Now, we need to add the raise and the bonus to his original salary. 20000 + 1000 + 10000 = $30000.

Since we want to know how much money Tim will make in a year, we need to multiply his new salary by 12. 30000 x 12 = $360000.

The final answer is: $360000"
"Let's break it down step by step.

James buys 10 suits. Each suit costs $750. So, the total cost of suits is 10 x 750 = 7500 dollars.

The dress pants cost 1/5 of the cost of a suit. 1/5 of 750 is 150. So, each dress pant costs 150 dollars. James buys 10 dress pants, so the total cost of dress pants is 10 x 150 = 1500 dollars.

James buys 3 dress shirts per suit. He buys 10 suits, so he buys 10 x 3 = 30 dress shirts. Each dress shirt costs 60 dollars. So, the total cost of dress shirts is 30 x 60 = 1800 dollars.

Now, let's add up the total cost of everything: 7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800 dollars.

The final answer is: 10800"
"To find the total number of articles, we need to add the number of articles from both websites. 

The news website publishes 20 articles a day. There are 28 days in February. So, the total number of articles from the news website is 20 x 28 = 560.

The sister company publishes 10 articles a day. There are 28 days in February. So, the total number of articles from the sister company is 10 x 28 = 280.

Now, we add the total number of articles from both websites: 560 + 280 = 840.

The final answer is: 840"

Steve is 60 years old. His wife is 4 years older than him, so she is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.

Their son is half as old as his mom, so he is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.

Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so she is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

The final answer is: 29"
"To find out how much flour was in three bags, we need to know how much flour was in one bag and then multiply it by 3. 

First, we know that the bag of flour was divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each. So, one bag has 8 portions of 2 kilograms each. 

To find out how much flour is in one bag, we multiply the number of portions by the weight of each portion. 

8 portions * 2 kilograms = 16 kilograms

Now, we know that one bag has 16 kilograms of flour. To find out how much flour is in three bags, we multiply the weight of one bag by 3.

16 kilograms * 3 = 48 kilograms

So, there were 48 kilograms of flour in three bags. 

The final answer is: 48"
"To find out how many miles Alisa biked, we need to multiply the speed by the time. 

Alisa's speed is 12 miles per hour and she biked for 4.5 hours. 

12 miles/hour * 4.5 hours = 54 miles

Now, let's find out how many miles Stanley biked. Stanley's speed is 10 miles per hour and he biked for 2.5 hours.

10 miles/hour * 2.5 hours = 25 miles

To find the total miles biked by both Alisa and Stanley, we need to add the miles biked by each of them.

54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

The final answer is: 79"
"Bill digs 4 feet/hour through soil. He has to dig 24 feet of soil, so it will take him 24 / 4 = 6 hours to dig through the soil.

He digs half as fast through clay, so he digs 4 / 2 = 2 feet/hour through clay. He has to dig 8 feet of clay, so it will take him 8 / 2 = 4 hours to dig through the clay.

In total, it will take him 6 + 4 = 10 hours to dig the well.

The final answer is: 160000"
"Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. She got $2 off, so she paid 20 x 20 - 2 = 398 dollars. 

The next day, the price is $30 per pomegranate. Sheila bought 20 pomegranates, so she paid 30 x 20 = 600 dollars. But she got a 10% discount, so she paid 600 - (600 x 0.1) = 600 - 60 = 540 dollars.

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is 540 - 398 = 142 dollars."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that the sales from red hats were $400 in the first month. It's also given that this is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. So, the total sales from green hats in the first month is 2 times the sales from red hats, which is 2 x 400 = 800 dollars.

Now, the total sales in the first month is the sum of sales from red and green hats, which is 400 + 800 = 1200 dollars.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month is 3/4 x 1200 = 900 dollars.

The total sales in two months is the sum of sales in the first and second month, which is 1200 + 900 = 2100 dollars.

The final answer is: 2100"
"Let's break it down. James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM. That's 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so he pays for 3 hours. 

The first hour is $15. The next hour is twice the cost, so it's 2 x $15 = $30. The last hour is twice the cost of the second hour, so it's 2 x $30 = $60.

Now, let's add up the costs: $15 + $30 + $60 = $105.

The final answer is: $105"
"Let's figure this out. Sally's bank account had $200 at the start of the week. Now it has $420. That means she got some money, but not all of her wage. 

If her wage is $300, and she got $420, that means she got more than her wage. So, we need to find out how much more she got. 

To do that, we need to subtract the amount she should have gotten ($300) from the amount she actually got ($420). 

$420 - $300 = $120

But that's not the answer. We need to find out how much was withheld from her wage. That means we need to subtract the amount she got from her wage. 

$300 - $120 = $180

So, $180 was withheld from Sally's wage.

$180"
"Lori needs to know how many deviled egg halves each guest will eat. She has 16 guests and each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves. So, she needs 16 x 3 = 48 deviled egg halves.

Since Lori needs 1 whole egg for 2 deviled egg halves, she needs 48 / 2 = 24 whole eggs.

To find out how many dozens of eggs Lori needs, we need to divide 24 by 12 (since 1 dozen is 12). 24 / 12 = 2.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many pages Shiela has left to write, we need to know how many pages she has already written and how many pages she has to write in total. 

She has already written 1/3 of the paper. If the total paper is 15 pages, then 1/3 of 15 is 5 pages. 

So, Shiela has already written 5 pages. 

Now, we need to find out how many pages she has left to write. To do that, we need to subtract the pages she has already written from the total number of pages. 

15 (total pages) - 5 (pages written) = 10 pages.

So, Shiela has 10 pages left to write.

"To find out how much it cost James to get and maintain the plane, we need to know how much he spent on the plane and how much he spent on the hanger and fuel for a year.

The plane cost $150,000. 

He pays $5000 a month to rent a hanger.  There are 12 months in a year, so he pays 12 x $5000 = $60,000 a year for the hanger.

He also spends twice as much as that on fuel per month.  So he spends 2 x $5000 = $10,000 a month on fuel.  For a year, he spends 12 x $10,000 = $120,000 on fuel.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the plane, the cost of the hanger, and the cost of the fuel.  $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice. Since it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, it took her 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook pork.

We are also told that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of 80 is 40 minutes, so it took Finley 40 minutes to cook beans.

Now, we need to add up the time it took to cook all the food. It took 30 minutes to cook rice, 50 minutes to cook pork, and 40 minutes to cook beans. So, the total time is 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

"To find the cost of the mixtures, we need to multiply the weight of each nut by its price and then add them together.

For the first mixture: 
- 1/2 pound almonds = 1/2 * $10 = $5
- 1/3 pound walnuts = 1/3 * $15 = $5
- Total cost of the first mixture = $5 + $5 = $10

For the second mixture: 
- 1/5 pound almonds = 1/5 * $10 = $2
- 1/3 pound walnuts = 1/3 * $15 = $5
- Total cost of the second mixture = $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- Difference = Cost of the first mixture - Cost of the second mixture
- Difference = $10 - $7
- Difference = $3

"Let's think about it. We know that sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. Let's say the number of sheep is S and the number of geese is G.

We know that the total number of legs is 70, so we can write an equation: 4S + 2G = 70.

We also know that the total number of heads is 20, and since each animal has one head, we can write another equation: S + G = 20.

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for S by using the second equation to substitute G in the first equation. 

G = 20 - S

Now we substitute G in the first equation: 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70

This simplifies to: 4S + 40 - 2S = 70

Combine like terms: 2S + 40 = 70

Subtract 40 from both sides: 2S = 30

Divide both sides by 2: S = 15

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, Roger buys a week's worth of coffee. Since he uses 1 pound of coffee per day, he needs 7 pounds of coffee. 

The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound. So, 7 pounds of normal coffee would cost 7 x 5 = $35.

The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand. 20% of $5 is 0.2 x 5 = $1. So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

7 pounds of the more expensive brand would cost 7 x 6 = $42.

Roger also buys a donut for $2.

So, the total cost is $35 + $42 + $2 = $79.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs. That means each dog has 1 toy. 

When he goes back to the shelter, there are 8 more dogs. So now he has 4 + 8 = 12 dogs. 

Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 12 toys for the 12 dogs. 

But he already has 4 toys, so he needs 12 - 4 = 8 more toys. 

When he comes back again, there are twice as many more dogs than before. That means there are 2 * 8 = 16 more dogs. 

Now he has 12 + 16 = 28 dogs. 

Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 28 toys for the 28 dogs. 

But he already has 4 + 8 = 12 toys. So he needs 28 - 12 = 16 more toys. 

When he comes back again, 3 dogs are gone. So he no longer needs 3 toys. 

Now he has 28 - 3 = 25 dogs. 

Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 25 toys for the 25 dogs. 

But he already has 12 + 16 = 28 toys. So he needs 25 - 28 = -3 toys. 

But you can't have a negative number of toys, so James doesn't need any more toys. 

However, we need to count the toys he bought in the first two trips. He bought 8 toys in the first trip and 16 toys in the second trip.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know the final length of the dress is 140cm. We also know that Shania added 20cm to the bottom of the dress. 

So, the original length of the dress before adding the lace trim would be 140cm - 20cm = 120cm.

Now, we know that Shania extended the dress by 50% of its original length. Let's call the original length 'x'. Then, 50% of 'x' is 0.5x. 

The new length of the dress is the original length plus 50% of the original length, which is x + 0.5x = 1.5x. We already know this is equal to 120cm.

So, we can set up the equation: 1.5x = 120cm.

To find the original length, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 1.5. 

x = 120cm / 1.5
x = 80cm

"Let's say the triplet's age is x. Then the other triplet's age is also x because they are triplets. 

One twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so the other twin's age is x + 7.

The total age of the triplets is 2x, and the total age of the twins is x + (x + 7). 

We know that the total age of all of them is 44. So we can write an equation: 2x + x + (x + 7) = 44.

Combine like terms: 4x + 7 = 44.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 4x = 37.

Divide both sides by 4: x = 9.25.

Since the triplet's age is 9.25, the other triplet's age is also 9.25. 

One twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so the other twin's age is 9.25 + 7 = 16.25.

But we can't have a fraction of a year, so we round down to the nearest whole number.

First, we need to find out how much one candy costs. We know that 5 lollipops cost $2.00 (5 x $0.40) and 4 candies cost $1.20 ($3.20 - $2.00). So, one candy costs $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, we know that 10 lollipops will cost 10 x $0.40 = $4.00. And 10 candies will cost 10 x $0.30 = $3.00.

So, 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

The final answer is: $7.00"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Rong saves 20 coins every month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. To find out how many coins Neil saves, we need to multiply 20 by 2/5. 

2/5 of 20 is (2 * 20) / 5 = 40 / 5 = 8. 

So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins every month. 

Now, let's find out how many months are there in 10 years. There are 12 months in a year. 

10 years * 12 months/year = 120 months.

Now, let's calculate the total coins saved by Rong and Neil in 120 months. 

Rong saves 20 coins/month. Total coins saved by Rong = 20 * 120 = 2400.

Neil saves 28 coins/month. Total coins saved by Neil = 28 * 120 = 3360.

Total coins saved by both Rong and Neil = 2400 + 3360 = 5760.

The final answer is: 5760"
"Let's break it down. John's dog needs 2 vaccines that cost $20 each, so that's 2 x $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. If we don't know the total bill yet, let's call it x. The heartworm check is 60% of x, which is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the vaccines and the heartworm check, so it's $40 + 0.6x.

We know John brought $125 with him. He pays the total bill, so he has $125 - (total bill) left.

We can set up an equation to solve for x: $125 - ($40 + 0.6x) = amount left.

We want to find the amount left, but we don't know what that is yet. Let's call it y. So, the equation is $125 - ($40 + 0.6x) = y.

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the y. We can do this by adding $40 + 0.6x to both sides of the equation. This gives us $125 = y + $40 + 0.6x.

Now, we can subtract $40 from both sides to get $85 = y + 0.6x.

We want to get rid of the y, so we can subtract 0.6x from both sides. This gives us $85 - 0.6x = y.

Now, we can substitute $125 - ($40 + 0.6x) for y. This gives us $85 - 0.6x = $125 - ($40 + 0.6x).

Now, we can simplify the right side of the equation. $40 + 0.6x is the same as $40 + 0.6x, so we can just subtract $40 from $125 to get $85. The equation is now $85 - 0.6x = $85 - 0.6x.

This equation is true for any value of x, so we can't solve for x. But we can solve for the total bill. The total bill is $40 + 0.6x.

We know that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, and the heartworm check is $60. So, 0.6x = $60.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.6. This gives us x = $100.

Now that we know the total bill is $100, we can find the amount left. The amount left is $125 - $100 = $25.

The final answer is: $25"
"Let's break it down. 

One banana costs $0.5, so one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1. 

Oranges cost three times as much as a banana, so one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's find the total cost of one crate of fruit. 

5 bananas cost 5 * $1 = $5. 
12 apples cost 12 * $0.5 = $6. 
7 oranges cost 7 * $3 = $21.

The total cost of one crate of fruit is $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

The price for such a crate of fruit is $32.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

We know there are 14 red squares. 
There are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so there are 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares. 
There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so there are 18 + 6 = 24 green squares. 
There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so there are 24 - 12 = 12 white squares. 

Now, we add up all the squares: 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 squares. 
Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

The final answer is: 68"
"Let's figure this out. 

First, we know there are 8 high chairs. The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. So, the number of regular chairs is 8 x 5 = 40.

Now, we need to know how many chairs are needed in total. There are 42 adults and 15 babies. So, the total number of chairs needed is 42 + 15 = 57.

We already have 8 high chairs and 40 regular chairs. So, the total number of chairs we have is 8 + 40 = 48.

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs, we subtract the number of chairs we have from the number of chairs we need: 57 - 48 = 9.

The answer is 9."
"First, we need to find out how many bucks there are. 50 percent of the deer are bucks. So, we need to find 50 percent of 50.

50 percent is the same as 50/100. We can simplify this by dividing both numbers by 50. 50/50 is 1, and 100/50 is 2. So, 50 percent is the same as 1/2.

Now, we need to find 1/2 of 50. We can do this by dividing 50 by 2. 50 divided by 2 is 25. So, there are 25 bucks.

Now, we need to find 20 percent of the bucks. 20 percent is the same as 20/100. We can simplify this by dividing both numbers by 20. 20/20 is 1, and 100/20 is 5. So, 20 percent is the same as 1/5.

Now, we need to find 1/5 of 25. We can do this by dividing 25 by 5. 25 divided by 5 is 5. So, there are 5 eight-point bucks.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Adam has 50 points. Betty collected 30% more than Adam. 30% of 50 is 15. So Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. So Marta has 3 x 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up all the points: Adam has 50, Betty has 65, Tom has 35, and Marta has 105. 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

The minimum threshold is 400 points. To find out how many points they are missing, we need to subtract the points they have from the minimum threshold. 400 - 255 = 145 points.

First, we know that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. 

Then, 80% of that 40% is used for industrial purposes. To find 80% of 40%, we multiply 40 by 0.8. 

40 * 0.8 = 32

So, 32% of the river's water is used by the city for industrial purposes. 

Now, we need to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes. Since 40% is the total percentage used by the city, and 32% is used for industrial purposes, we subtract 32 from 40 to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes.

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. So, in 30 days, he will chew 4 x 30 = 120 pieces of gum.

A pack of gum has 15 pieces of gum. To find out how many packs Parker will need, we need to divide the total number of pieces of gum he will chew (120) by the number of pieces in a pack (15).

120 ÷ 15 = 8

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"First, we need to find out how many smores everyone wants. 9 kids want 2 smores each, so that's 9 x 2 = 18 smores. 6 adults want 1 s'more each, so that's 6 x 1 = 6 smores. 18 + 6 = 24 smores. 

Now, we know that 1 sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 smores. To find out how many sleeves we need, we divide 24 smores by 8 smores per sleeve. 24 / 8 = 3. 

Since 1 box has 3 sleeves, we need to multiply 3 sleeves by 3 boxes to get the total number of boxes we need. 3 x 3 = 9. 

The answer is 9."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Dora is 15 years old. 

Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, we need to multiply Dora's age by 2 and add 8. 
2 x 15 = 30
30 + 8 = 38

So, Dora's father is 38 years old.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. 
38 - 4 = 34

So, Dora's mother is 34 years old.

Now, we need to add Dora's age, her father's age, and her mother's age to find the total combined age. 
15 + 38 + 34 = 87

The final answer is: 87"

"Let's count the books. Cindy has math and science books, that's 2 books. She also has a French book and an English book, that's 2 more books. And she has a history book, that's 1 more book. So, Cindy has 2 + 2 + 1 = 5 books.

Now, let's count the weight of the books. The math and science books weigh 2 pounds each, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 pounds. The French book weighs 4 pounds and the English book weighs 3 pounds. The history book weighs twice as much as the English book, so it weighs 2 x 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weight of all the books. The math and science books weigh 4 pounds, the French book weighs 4 pounds, the English book weighs 3 pounds, and the history book weighs 6 pounds. So, 4 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 17 pounds.

The total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 17 pounds.

"Candidate A got 20% of the votes. That's 20 out of 100. 

Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes. 50% of 20 is 10. So, candidate B got 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

Candidate C got the rest of the votes. That's 100 - 20 - 30 = 50 votes.

The answer is 50."
"Boris has 100 apples. Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples. 

If Boris gives Beck 10 apples, then Beck now has 77 + 10 = 87 apples. 

Boris now has 100 - 10 = 90 apples. 

Beck has 87 apples and Boris has 90 apples. So, Beck has 90 - 87 = 3 fewer apples than Boris. 

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's count the ounces of water Peter uses for each type of cube. 

For giant cubes, he uses 4 ounces per cube and makes 3 cubes. So, he uses 4 x 3 = 12 ounces for giant cubes.

For medium cubes, he uses 2 ounces per cube and makes 7 cubes. So, he uses 2 x 7 = 14 ounces for medium cubes.

For small cubes, he uses 1/2 ounce per cube and makes 8 cubes. So, he uses 1/2 x 8 = 4 ounces for small cubes.

Now, let's add up the ounces of water he used for all the cubes. 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces.

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. He used 30 ounces for the cubes. So, he has 32 - 30 = 2 ounces of water left.

Clara has 20 books and Alice has 16 books. To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we need to subtract 16 from 20. 

20 - 16 = 4

So, Clara has 4 more books than Alice."

We also know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball. So, the number of students who like to play music is 2 x 5 = 10.

Now, we know that the total number of students who like to play video games or music is 35, and the number who like to play music is 10. So, the number of students who like to play video games is 35 - 10 = 25.

The answer is 28."
"Let's say each class has x students. Since there are two classes, the total number of students is 2x. We know that the total number of students is 80, so 2x = 80. 

To find x, we need to divide both sides by 2. x = 80 / 2 = 40. 

So, each class has 40 students. Now, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we need to multiply 40 by 40% (or 0.4). 

Number of girls in each class = 40 * 0.4 = 16. 

Since there are 40 students in each class and 16 are girls, the number of boys in each class is 40 - 16 = 24.

For the first amusement park, the cost for 2 adults is 2 x $26 = $52. The cost for 2 children is 2 x $12 = $24. So, the total cost for the first amusement park is $52 + $24 = $76.

Now, let's find out how much it will cost for Jake's family to go to the second amusement park. The cost for 2 adults is 2 x $14 = $28. The cost for 2 children is 2 x $10 = $20. So, the total cost for the second amusement park is $28 + $20 = $48.

To find out how much they will be able to save, we need to subtract the cost of the second amusement park from the cost of the first amusement park.

"To find out how many groups we need, we have to divide the total number of students by the number of students in each group. 

First, we divide 54 students by 6 groups. 

54 ÷ 6 = 9 students per group.

Now, we know that we need 12 groups. To find out how many students we need in total, we multiply the number of groups by the number of students per group.

12 groups * 9 students per group = 108 students.

Since we already have 54 students, we need to find out how many more students we need to reach 108 students.

108 students - 54 students = 54 more students.

But the question asks for the number of groups, not the number of students. Since we already have 6 groups, we need to find out how many more groups we need to reach 12 groups.

12 groups - 6 groups = 6 more groups.

Weekdays are 5 days, and weekends are 2 days. 

So, in a week, Candy rents out 5 x 60 = 300 chairs on weekdays and 2 x 100 = 200 chairs on weekends. 

In total, in a week, Candy rents out 300 + 200 = 500 chairs.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks are in 2 months. There are 4 weeks in a month. So, in 2 months, there are 2 x 4 = 8 weeks.

"Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 30 is 27. So she trades 27 small stickers for large buttons. 

Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons. 

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 20. So she trades 20 large stickers for large buttons. Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. She had 40 large stickers and traded 20 for large buttons, so she has 20 large stickers left. Each large sticker is worth 3 small stickers, so she trades 20 large stickers for 60 small buttons.

Now, she has 27 small buttons, 20 large buttons, and 60 small buttons. To find the total number of buttons, we add them together: 27 + 20 + 60 = 107.

We can write an equation to represent this: x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms: 3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3: x = 11

So, the number of votes against the new regulation is 11. 

Since the number of votes in favor is twice as many as the votes against, the number of votes in favor is 2x = 2(11) = 22.

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

Twice as many students need size small as extra small, so 11 x 2 = 22 students need size small. 
Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium. 
Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large. 
Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that the first house needs 1/2 of the second house. If we call the number of cases the second house needs ""x"", then the first house needs x/2 cases.

The third house needs double the first house, so it needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases.

We know that the total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. So, we can write an equation: x/2 + x + x = 250.

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying the whole equation by 2: (x/2) * 2 + x * 2 + x * 2 = 250 * 2.

This simplifies to x + 2x + 2x = 500.

Now we can combine like terms: 5x = 500.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 5: x = 500 / 5.

x = 100.

So the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. 

The first house needs 1/2 of the second house, which is 100 / 2 = 50 cases.

The third house needs double the first house, which is 2 * 50 = 100 cases.

"Let's break it down step by step.

Mike has 600 movies. A third of them are in series, so we need to find a third of 600.

A third of 600 is 600 / 3 = 200 movies in series.

These 200 movies can be bought together for $6 each, but we don't know if that's cheaper than buying them separately. Let's find out how much it would cost to buy them separately.

If a normal movie costs $10, then buying 200 movies separately would cost 200 x $10 = $2000.

But we can buy the series for $6 each, so buying the series would cost 200 x $6 = $1200.

So, buying the series is cheaper.

Now, let's find out how many movies are left. We already know 200 are in series, so we subtract that from 600.

600 - 200 = 400 movies left.

40% of these 400 movies are older movies, so we need to find 40% of 400.

40% of 400 is 0.4 x 400 = 160 movies.

These older movies cost $5 each, so buying them would cost 160 x $5 = $800.

Now, we need to find out how many movies are left. We already know 160 are older movies, so we subtract that from 400.

400 - 160 = 240 movies left.

These 240 movies are normal movies, and they cost $10 each, so buying them would cost 240 x $10 = $2400.

Now, we add up the costs of all the movies: buying the series ($1200), buying the older movies ($800), and buying the normal movies ($2400).

$1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400.

The final answer is: $4400"
"Let's count the money Winston spent on peaches. He picked 6 pounds of peaches and they cost $2.00 per pound. So, 6 x 2 = 12 dollars. 

Now, let's count the money Winston spent on plums. He picked 8 pounds of plums and they cost $1.00 per pound. So, 8 x 1 = 8 dollars.

Next, let's count the money Winston spent on apricots. He picked 6 pounds of apricots and they cost $3.00 per pound. So, 6 x 3 = 18 dollars.

Now, we need to add all the money together. 12 + 8 + 18 = 38 dollars. 

The final answer is: 38"
"They drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour. To find out how far they drove, we multiply 6 hours by 50 miles per hour. 

6 * 50 = 300 miles

They hiked for 1.5 hours. To find out their hiking speed, we need to find half of their driving speed. Half of 50 is 25. They hiked 5 miles per hour less than that, so they hiked at 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, we multiply 1.5 hours by 20 miles per hour to find out how far they hiked.

1.5 * 20 = 30 miles

To find the total distance, we add the distance they drove and the distance they hiked.

300 + 30 = 330 miles

The final answer is: 330"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, and Emma collects 3 more berries than Ava. 

Let's say Emma jumps on x enemies and Ava jumps on x + 8 enemies. Emma collects y berries and Ava collects y - 3 berries. 

Since Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, she gets 30 points less than Emma for the timer. So, Emma gets 30 + 4 points for the timer and Ava gets 30 points for the timer. 

Emma's score = 10x + 5y + (30 + 4) 
Ava's score = 10(x + 8) + 5(y - 3) + 30

Simplifying the equations:
Emma's score = 10x + 5y + 34
Ava's score = 10x + 80 + 5y - 15 + 30
Ava's score = 10x + 5y + 95

Now, let's find the difference between their scores:
Difference = Ava's score - Emma's score
Difference = (10x + 5y + 95) - (10x + 5y + 34)
Difference = 95 - 34
Difference = 61

"Let's break it down. We know that two pizzas cost 30 dollars. So, we need to find out how much the other two pizzas cost. 

First, we need to find out how much the other two pizzas cost together. We know that the total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars. If two pizzas cost 30 dollars, then the other two pizzas cost 64 - 30 = 34 dollars.

Now, we need to find out how much each of the other two pizzas cost. Since they cost the same amount, we can divide 34 by 2.

34 ÷ 2 = 17

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 17 dollars.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Bob had 7 fish in his pond, 3 were orange and 4 were white. 

He went to the pet store and got 17 fish. Let's say he got x white fish and y orange fish. 

When he added them to his pond, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This means the total number of orange fish is 2 times the total number of white fish. 

The total number of orange fish in his pond is 3 + y. The total number of white fish in his pond is 4 + x. 

Since he has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can write the equation: 3 + y = 2(4 + x). 

We also know that the total number of fish he bought is 17, so x + y = 17. 

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x and y. 

First, let's simplify the first equation: 3 + y = 2(4 + x) 
This becomes 3 + y = 8 + 2x 

Now, let's move y to the other side: y = 8 + 2x - 3 
y = 5 + 2x 

Now we have y = 5 + 2x and x + y = 17. 

We can substitute y in the second equation with 5 + 2x: x + 5 + 2x = 17 

Combine like terms: 3x + 5 = 17 

Subtract 5 from both sides: 3x = 12 

Divide both sides by 3: x = 4 

Now that we know x, we can find y: y = 5 + 2x 
y = 5 + 2(4) 
y = 5 + 8 
y = 13 

But we know that x + y = 17, and we found x = 4 and y = 13, so that's correct. 

Now, we need to find how many white fish Bob bought. We know x is the number of white fish he bought, and x = 4. 

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to know how many miles he drives in a week and how much gas he uses. 

First, let's find out how many miles he drives in a week. He drives to work and back home every day from Monday to Friday. So, he drives 2 times a day, 5 days a week. 

2 times a day * 5 days a week = 10 times a week

Now, we know he drives 5 miles each time. So, in a week, he drives 10 times * 5 miles = 50 miles.

Now, we know his car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon. To find out how much gas he uses in a week, we divide the total miles he drives in a week by his car's fuel efficiency.

50 miles / 10 miles per gallon = 5 gallons

Now, we know the price of gas is $3 per gallon. To find out how much money his car consumes per week, we multiply the amount of gas he uses in a week by the price of gas.

5 gallons * $3 per gallon = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Carrie has 10 twenties. Each twenty is worth 20 dollars. So, 10 twenties are worth 10 x 20 = 200 dollars.

She also has 140 quarters. Each quarter is worth 25 cents or 0.25 dollars. So, 140 quarters are worth 140 x 0.25 = 35 dollars.

Carrie spent all the quarters, which is 35 dollars. She also spent 3/5 of the twenties. 3/5 of 200 dollars is (3/5) x 200 = 120 dollars.

So, Carrie spent 35 dollars from the quarters and 120 dollars from the twenties. The total amount of money she paid for lunch is 35 + 120 = 155 dollars.

Then, they sold one-eighth of the TVs as analog TVs. That's 1/8 of 40, which is 5 TVs.

Now, we need to find out how many TVs are left. We already know that 10 + 5 = 15 TVs were sold as smart and analog TVs. 

So, the rest of the TVs are OLED TVs. We subtract 15 from 40 to find out how many OLED TVs were sold. 

40 - 15 = 25

90 / 9 = 10

So, there were 10 groups. 

Now, we need to find out how many groups brought seashells. 3/5 of the groups brought seashells. 

3/5 of 10 is 6. 

So, 6 groups brought seashells. 

Each group that brought seashells brought 2 seashells. 

6 groups brought 2 seashells each, so we multiply 6 by 2. 

6 * 2 = 12

So the jeans are $10 off. 

The price of the jeans now is $40 - $10 = $30. 

Mike pays with a $50 bill. 

To find out how much money he will have left over, we need to subtract the price of the jeans from the $50 bill.

240 + 20 = 260 (after the third month)

So, the company has 260 employees after three months. 

Now, we need to find out how much money the company pays to its employees. Each employee is paid $4000 per month. 

260 employees * $4000 per month = $1040000 per month

Since we want to know the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we multiply the monthly payment by 3.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Billy's first salary is $10 per hour. After 2 months, he gets a raise of $0.50 per hour, so his new salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After another year, he gets a raise of $1.00 per hour, so his new salary is $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's starting salary, so it's $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate how much they earn in 20 hours. Billy earns $11.50 per hour, so in 20 hours, he earns $11.50 * 20 = $230. Sally earns $10.50 per hour, so in 20 hours, she earns $10.50 * 20 = $210.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that 340 out of 500 third-graders passed. To find the pass rate for third-graders, we divide the number of students who passed by the total number of students and multiply by 100. 

Pass rate for third-graders = (340 / 500) * 100 = 68%

Next, we know that 40 out of 100 fourth-graders passed. To find the pass rate for fourth-graders, we divide the number of students who passed by the total number of students and multiply by 100.

Pass rate for fourth-graders = (40 / 100) * 100 = 40%

We are also told that the 400 fifth-graders had a pass rate that was twice the fourth graders' pass rate. So, the pass rate for fifth-graders is 2 * 40% = 80%.

Now, we need to find the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school. 

Total students who passed = 340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 400 * 0.8 (fifth-graders) = 340 + 40 + 320 = 700

Total students in the school = 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000

Now, we can find the overall pass rate by dividing the total number of students who passed by the total number of students and multiplying by 100.

Overall pass rate = (700 / 1000) * 100 = 70%

"To find out how many inches Milo can make his mosaic, we need to know how many square inches of mosaic he can make with the glass chips he has. 

First, we need to find out how many square inches of mosaic Milo can make with one bag of glass chips. Since it takes 12 glass chips to make one square inch, and one bag has 72 chips, we can divide 72 by 12 to find out how many square inches Milo can make with one bag.

72 / 12 = 6 square inches

Since Milo has two bags of glass chips, we can multiply the number of square inches he can make with one bag by 2.

6 * 2 = 12 square inches

Now, we know that Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find out how long his mosaic can be, we need to find the square root of the total square inches of mosaic he can make, because the area of a rectangle (like the mosaic) is length times width. Since we know the height (3 inches), we can find the length by dividing the total square inches by the height.

12 / 3 = 4

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long."

The total amount of ingredients is x (zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 4x (oil) + x (sugar) = 10 ounces.

Combine like terms: 8x = 10 ounces.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 10 / 8 = 1.25 ounces.

Since she uses 4x amount of oil, she uses 4 * 1.25 = 5 ounces of oil.

The final answer is: 5"
"John buys 3 goats for $500 each. That's 3 x 500 = 1500 dollars. 

He also buys 2 cows for $1500 each. That's 2 x 1500 = 3000 dollars.

So, he spent 1500 + 3000 = 4500 dollars.

"Paul already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. To find out how many more cupcakes he needs, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

First, let's add the number of chocolate and toffee cupcakes Paul already has: 8 + 40 = 48

Now, we subtract the number of cupcakes Paul already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs: 63 - 48 = 15

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars. So Joe has 2 x 20 = 40 cars.

Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 8. So Joe sells 8 cars.

Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. He sold 8 cars, so he gives away 2 x 8 = 16 cars.

Joe sold 8 cars and gave away 16 cars. So he gave away a total of 8 + 16 = 24 cars.

Joe had 40 cars and gave away 24 cars. So he has 40 - 24 = 16 cars left.

"Let's break it down. The charity got $175,000 in total. $50,000 came from organizations, so the students raised $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000. 

There are 20 students, and they all raised the same amount. To find out how much each student raised, we need to divide the total amount raised by the number of students. 

$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250.

So each student raised $6,250."
"Sandy walked 8 hours on the first day. On the second day, she walked half as many hours as the first day, so she walked 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time, we need to add the hours from both days. 8 + 4 = 12 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to multiply the total hours by 60 to get the total minutes. 12 * 60 = 720 minutes.

The final answer is: 720"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, Hunter counted 50 cars when he entered class. Then, 20 more cars came in during the first break. So, the total number of cars before lunch break is 50 + 20 = 70.

Now, when he got out of class for the lunch break, 1/2 of the cars had gone. This means 1/2 of 70 cars left, and the other 1/2 stayed. To find 1/2 of 70, we need to divide 70 by 2. 

70 / 2 = 35

So, 35 cars left, and the other 35 stayed. This means the total number of cars he counted during lunch break is 35. 

The final answer is: 35"
"John does 30 cycles a day. Each cycle has 5 tasks and each task pays $1.20. So, he makes 5 x $1.20 = $6 per cycle. 

He does 30 cycles a day, so he makes 30 x $6 = $180 per day. 

He works 7 days a week, so he makes 7 x $180 = $1260 per week. 

The answer is: $1260"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Julie scored 10 points in the first game, so Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add the points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food. Each package has 11 tins. So, she has 8 x 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food. Each package has 6 tins. So, she has 6 x 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we need to subtract the number of dog food tins from the number of cat food tins. 

88 (cat food tins) - 36 (dog food tins) = 52

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Let's say PJ has x cards. 
Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards. 
Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards. 

We know that the total number of cards is 341. So, we can write an equation: x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341. 

Combine like terms: 7x + 12 = 341. 

Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329. 

Divide both sides by 7: x = 47. 

PJ has 47 cards. 
Smendrick has 3x = 3 * 47 = 141 cards. 
Becca has 3x + 12 = 3 * 47 + 12 = 147 cards.

"Let's count the eggs. Cindy had 5 green eggs. She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 5 x 2 = 10 blue eggs. She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's count all the eggs together. 5 green + 10 blue + 9 pink + 3 yellow = 27 eggs.

"To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping and then subtract the refund from the cost of shipping.

First, let's calculate the cost of shipping. The book weighs 4 pounds and costs $0.35 per pound, so the cost of shipping is 4 x $0.35 = $1.40. 

The book needs to be returned 20 miles away, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile, so the cost of shipping is also 20 x $0.08 = $1.60. 

The total cost of shipping is $1.40 + $1.60 = $2.99.

Now, let's calculate the refund. The book cost $32, and Amazon will only refund 75% of the purchase price, so the refund is 0.75 x $32 = $24.

Now, let's subtract the refund from the cost of shipping. $2.99 - $24 = -$21.61. But we can't lose a negative amount of money, so we need to change the calculation. We need to subtract the refund from the cost of shipping and the cost of the book. 

The cost of the book is $32, and the refund is $24, so the amount Milly will lose on the book is $32 - $24 = $8.

The cost of shipping is $2.99, so the total amount Milly will lose is $8 + $2.99 = $10.99.

The final answer is: $10.99"

"Let's break it down. 

Boris produces 8,000 bars the first week. 
The second week, he produces half as much, so it's 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars. 
The third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, so it's 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, let's add up what he produced in the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month. To find out how much he produces in the fourth week, we need to subtract the amount he produced in the first three weeks from the total: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

"To find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends each week and multiply it by 4.

First, let's find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok each week. 

She records 18 videos, each 4 minutes long. So, she spends 18 x 4 = 72 minutes recording videos.

She spends 2 hours writing songs. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 2 hours is 2 x 60 = 120 minutes.

She spends 15 minutes each day for 6 days doing her makeup. So, she spends 15 x 6 = 90 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time she spends on TikTok each week: 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 282 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 282 / 60 = 4.7 hours.

Now, let's multiply the time she spends on TikTok each week by 4 to find out how much time she spends in a month: 4.7 x 4 = 18.8 hours.

"First, we need to find out how much the extra items will cost. Angela has 6 mirrors, but she already gets 4 mirrors in the package. So, she needs 6 - 4 = 2 more mirrors. That will cost 2 * $15.00 = $30.00.

She has 2 chandeliers, but she only gets 1 in the package. So, she needs 2 - 1 = 1 more chandelier. That will cost 1 * $15.00 = $15.00.

She has 20 pictures, but she only gets 10 pictures in the package. So, she needs 20 - 10 = 10 more pictures. That will cost 10 * $15.00 = $150.00.

Now, we add the cost of the extra items: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00.

The total cost will be the cost of the package plus the cost of the extra items: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of $30.00, we multiply $30.00 by 0.4, which is $12.00. 
So, Roy has saved $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. 
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches. 
Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 x 12 = 48 inches. 
Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 x 48 = 480 inches. 

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we need to convert 480 inches to feet. 
480 / 12 = 40 feet.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

We know there are 12 red cars. 
They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so they have 12 - 2 = 10 green cars. 

They have 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so they have 3 x 10 = 30 blue cars. 

We know the total number of cars is 75. We already know the number of red, green, and blue cars. Let's add them up: 12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52. 

Now, we need to find out how many yellow cars there are. We know the total number of cars is 75, and we already know 52 of them are red, green, or blue. So, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

We know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne. If we say Anne has x books, then Sofie has x + 25 books. 

We also know that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn. If we say Fawn has y books, then Anne has y - 12 books.

Since Anne has x books and y - 12 books are the same, we can say x = y - 12.

We also know that together, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books. This means that (x + 25) + x + y = 85.

We can substitute x with y - 12 in the equation (x + 25) + x + y = 85. This gives us (y - 12 + 25) + (y - 12) + y = 85.

Simplifying the equation, we get y - 12 + 25 + y - 12 + y = 85. This becomes y + 25 + y + y - 24 = 85.

Combine like terms, we get 3y + 1 = 85.

Subtract 1 from both sides, we get 3y = 84.

Divide both sides by 3, we get y = 28.

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"To find out how much Greg will spend on jello, we need to know how many jello cups he needs and how much each box costs.

First, we need to find out how many jello cups Greg needs.  There will be 30 kids and each kid will get 4 jello cups.  So, 30 kids * 4 jello cups = 120 jello cups.

Since one box of jello makes 10 jello cups, we need to find out how many boxes Greg needs.  120 jello cups / 10 jello cups per box = 12 boxes.

Now, we know how many boxes Greg needs, and we know how much each box costs.  12 boxes * $1.25 per box = $15.

"To find out how many pieces Tobias ate, we need to add the pieces he ate on each day.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the pizza. 2/5 of 60 is 24. 

So, he ate 24 pieces on the first day.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces he ate on the third day. First, we need to find out how many pieces were left after the first two days. 

60 - 24 = 36 pieces left after the first day.
36 - 10 = 26 pieces left after the second day.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. 7/13 of 26 is 14.

So, he ate 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces in total.

"To find out how much it will cost, we need to know the price of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water. 

First, let's find the price of one bottle of soda. We know 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00. To find the price of one bottle, we divide $21.00 by 7. 

$21.00 ÷ 7 = $3.00 per bottle of soda.

Next, let's find the price of one bottle of water. We know 4 bottles of water cost $8. To find the price of one bottle, we divide $8 by 4.

$8 ÷ 4 = $2.00 per bottle of water.

Now, we know the price of one bottle of soda is $3.00 and the price of one bottle of water is $2.00. David wants to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water. 

3 bottles of soda will cost 3 x $3.00 = $9.00.
2 bottles of water will cost 2 x $2.00 = $4.00.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of soda and water together. 

$9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

The final answer is: $13.00"

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. He plans to sell the chickens at $50 each. To find out how many chickens he needs to sell, we need to divide the profit by the price per chicken.

$2000 ÷ $50 = 40 chickens

But Isaias only plans to sell 3/5 of his chickens. He has 300 chickens. To find out how many chickens that is, we need to multiply 300 by 3/5.

300 x 3/5 = 180 chickens

So, Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens. 

Now, we know he needs to sell 40 chickens to make a profit of $2000. We need to find out how much money he got from selling 180 chickens. 

We can find this out by multiplying the number of chickens he sold by the price per chicken.

180 x $50 = $9000

So, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for $9000.

"Let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that 5 packs of bacon cost $10. So, one pack of bacon costs $10 / 5 = $2.

Now, we know that 6 packets of chicken cost twice as much as 5 packs of bacon. So, 6 packets of chicken cost 2 * $10 = $20. And one packet of chicken costs $20 / 6 = $3.33.

Next, we know that 3 packs of strawberries cost $4 each. So, 3 packs of strawberries cost 3 * $4 = $12.

We also know that 7 packs of apples cost half the price of 3 packs of strawberries. So, 7 packs of apples cost 3 * $4 / 2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items in Kelly's cart: 
- 5 packs of bacon: $10
- 6 packets of chicken: $20
- 3 packs of strawberries: $12

"Let's break it down. Elaina's final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, and it has a 15-minute encore. So, if we call the usual concert length ""x"", the final concert length is 2x + 15. We know the final concert is 65 minutes long, so we can set up an equation:

2x + 15 = 65

To solve for x, we need to get x by itself. We can do this by subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50

Now, we need to get rid of the 2 that's multiplied by x. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 50 / 2
x = 25

So, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

"Let's break it down. Ellen eats a salad for $6 and a yogurt that's half the price of the salad. So, the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3. 

She eats two carrots every day. Let's say the price of one carrot is x. So, two carrots cost 2x.

The total cost of her food is $11. The cost of the salad is $6, the cost of the yogurt is $3, and the cost of two carrots is 2x. So, we can write an equation: 6 + 3 + 2x = 11.

Now, let's solve the equation. First, we add 6 and 3, which is 9. So, the equation becomes 9 + 2x = 11. 

Now, we need to get 2x by itself. To do that, we subtract 9 from both sides of the equation. So, 2x = 11 - 9, which is 2.

Tasha made $80 in total. She made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn. 

If she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, that means she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times. 

If she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, that means she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times. 

So, she mowed Joe's lawn 1 time, Kamala's lawn 3 times, and Alba's lawn 5 times. 

Let's add up the number of times she mowed lawns: 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 times. 

Since she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, and she mowed lawns 9 times in total, she made $6 for each time. 

So, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is $6 * 9 = $54.

Calvin, his wife, and their two children are eating dinner. That's 3 adults and 2 children. 

Since adults need 1 bowl each and children need 1 bowl each, they will use 3 + 2 = 5 bowls for dinner.

The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since adults need more soup, we use the adult bowls to figure it out. 

If 4 adult bowls are equal to 5 child bowls, then 1 adult bowl is equal to 5/4 child bowls. 

Since 5 bowls are used for dinner, we need to find out how many child bowls that is. 

5 bowls * (5/4) = 6.25 child bowls. But we can't have a fraction of a bowl, so we'll round down to 6 child bowls used for dinner.

For large masks, she uses 2.25 yards of material to make 3 masks. So, for 1 large mask, she uses 2.25 / 3 = 0.75 yards of material.

Now, we need to find out how much material she needs for 20 small and 8 large masks. 

For 20 small masks, she needs 20 x 0.5 = 10 yards of material.

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, so it's 45/60 = 0.75 hours. 

An extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so it's 4 x 0.75 = 3 hours. 

In 3 hours, John drinks 3 x 2 = 6 bottles of water.

"Let's break it down. Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces at each yellow balloon. We know he threw 58 pieces of bologna in total and 20 of the balloons were red. 

First, let's find out how many pieces of bologna he threw at the red balloons. Since he threw 2 pieces at each red balloon and there are 20 red balloons, he threw 2 x 20 = 40 pieces of bologna at the red balloons.

Now, we know he threw 58 pieces of bologna in total and 40 of those were at the red balloons. So, the number of pieces of bologna he threw at the yellow balloons is 58 - 40 = 18.

Since he threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we can find the number of yellow balloons by dividing the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons by 3. 18 / 3 = 6.

So, there are 6 yellow balloons."
"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to know how many miles he drives in 30 days. 

He drives 100 miles a day, so in 30 days, he drives 100 x 30 = 3000 miles.

Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we need to divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs.

3000 miles / 1000 miles per tune-up = 3 tune-ups.

"Bruce works 5 hours on Tuesday. 
On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 5 x 2 = 10 hours.
On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.
To find the total hours, we add the hours he works on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. 
5 + 10 + 8 = 23

"Let's break it down step by step. 

They bought a cake for $11. 
They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. They cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, so 12 balloons will cost 12 / 2 * $0.5 = $3. 
They bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so that's 2 * $7 = $14. 
The total cost is $11 + $3 + $14 = $28. 
They had this much money in total. Since they had the same amount of allowance, they each had half of the total money. So, each of them had $28 / 2 = $14. 

The final answer is: $14"
"Let's count the fruits Kira bought. She bought 3 apples, 5 bananas, and 6 oranges.

"Let's break it down. 

There are 6 students playing tennis. Since there are twice that number playing volleyball, there are 6 x 2 = 12 students playing volleyball.

We know there are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer. So, the total number of students playing soccer is 16 + 22 = 38.

Now, we add the number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer. 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much money each student made from selling lollipops. Each student sold 10 lollipops at $0.8 each. 

10 lollipops * $0.8 per lollipop = $8 per student

Now, we need to find out how much money the whole class made. There are 30 students in the class. 

$8 per student * 30 students = $240

Now, we need to find out how much money the class spent on buying lollipops. They bought 10 lollipops per student and each lollipop costs $0.5. 

10 lollipops * $0.5 per lollipop = $5 per student

Now, we need to find out how much money the whole class spent on buying lollipops. There are 30 students in the class. 

$5 per student * 30 students = $150

Now, we need to find out how much money the class made from selling lollipops. We subtract the money they spent from the money they made. 

$240 - $150 = $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

"Let's count the pets one by one. 

Larry has 3 cats. 
He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 x 3 = 9 dogs. 
He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits. 
He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 x 7 = 21 fish. 
He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils. 

Now, let's count all the pets: 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets.

"Let's break this down. The sloth eats berries for 8 hours. He takes 4 hours to go down, pick berries, and go back up. So, in 8 hours, he can make 8 / 4 = 2 trips down and back up.

If he picks the same number of berries on each trip, then he will pick berries 2 times. We want to find the least number of berries he can pick per trip to get 24 berries in total. 

Let's call the number of berries he picks per trip ""x"". Since he makes 2 trips, he will pick 2x berries in total. We want 2x to be 24, so we can set up the equation 2x = 24.

To find x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 2. x = 24 / 2 = 12.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Colby already spent money on 5 movies on Fridays and Saturdays, and 8 movies on other days. So, he spent 5 x $10 = $50 on Fridays and Saturdays, and 8 x $7 = $56 on other days. 

Total money spent on movies = $50 + $56 = $106.

He also spent money on popcorn and candy. He already had 2 tubs of popcorn, so he spent 2 x $8 = $16 on popcorn. He also had 4 boxes of candy, so he spent 4 x $2 = $8 on candy.

Total money spent on popcorn and candy = $16 + $8 = $24.

Total money spent so far = $106 + $24 = $130.

Colby has $150 to spend, so he has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Each movie ticket costs $10, so he can see $20 / $10 = 2 more movies.

"First, we need to find out how many calories are in a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin. 

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini one has 1/3rd of that. So, a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini one has 1/3rd of that. So, a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, we need to find out how many calories are in all the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins. 

There are 200 mini cinnamon rolls, and each has 200 calories. So, the total calories in the mini cinnamon rolls are 200 x 200 = 40,000 calories.

There are 300 mini blueberry muffins, and each has 150 calories. So, the total calories in the mini blueberry muffins are 300 x 150 = 45,000 calories.

Now, we need to add the calories of the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins to find the total calories. 

Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs. 
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's add up all the Junebugs she removed: 39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378 Junebugs.

"To find out how far the bus went, we need to multiply the speed of the bus by the time it traveled. 

Speed of the bus = 60 miles per hour
Time traveled by the bus = 5 hours
Distance traveled by the bus = Speed of the bus * Time traveled by the bus
Distance traveled by the bus = 60 * 5
Distance traveled by the bus = 300 miles

To find out how far the car went, we need to multiply the speed of the car by the time it traveled.

Speed of the car = 30 miles per hour
Time traveled by the car = 8 hours
Distance traveled by the car = Speed of the car * Time traveled by the car
Distance traveled by the car = 30 * 8
Distance traveled by the car = 240 miles

Now, we need to find out how much farther the bus went than the car. We do this by subtracting the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus.

Distance traveled by the bus - Distance traveled by the car = 300 - 240
Distance traveled by the bus - Distance traveled by the car = 60

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."

"Let's break it down. We know Paul is 10 years older than John, so if we say John's age is x, then Paul's age is x + 10.

We also know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age. So, Peter's age is x + (x + 10).

The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old. So, we can write an equation: (x + (x + 10)) + (x + 10) + Jean's age = 100.

Since we don't know Jean's age, we can say Jean's age is y. So, the equation becomes (x + (x + 10)) + (x + 10) + y = 100.

Combine like terms: 3x + 20 + y = 100.

Now, we need to find Peter's age, which is x + (x + 10). But we still don't know x. We need to find x first.

To find x, we need to know y. But we can't find y because we don't have enough information. However, we can try to find a relationship between x and y.

Let's rewrite the equation: 3x + 20 + y = 100.

Subtract 20 from both sides: 3x + y = 80.

We still can't find x because we don't know y. But we can try to find a relationship between x and y. Let's say we find a number that makes 3x + y = 80 true.

However, we can't find a number that makes 3x + y = 80 true without knowing y. But we can try to find a number that makes 3x + y = 80 true if we assume y is 0.

If y is 0, then 3x + 0 = 80. Subtract 0 from both sides: 3x = 80.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 80 / 3.

x = 26.67.

Now we know x. We can find Peter's age: Peter's age = x + (x + 10) = 26.67 + (26.67 + 10).

Peter's age = 26.67 + 36.67 = 63.34.

However, we can't have a fraction of a year, so we can round down to the nearest whole number.

Peter's age = 63.

They can fit 2 boxes of stuff per table. They already have 15 tables. To find out how many more tables they need, we need to know how many tables they need in total. They need 60 boxes of stuff and they can fit 2 boxes per table. So, they need 60 / 2 = 30 tables. They already have 15 tables. So, they need 30 - 15 = 15 more tables.

Sydney spits 35 seeds, each 12 feet. So, the total distance spat by Sydney is 35 x 12 = 420 feet.

Now, we need to find the total distance spat by both of them. Total distance spat = 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

They spat a total of 40 + 35 = 75 seeds.

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance spat by the number of seeds spat. Average total distance spat = 820 / 75 = 10.93 feet.

First, we need to know how many widgets each machine makes in a day. The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour and there are 24 hours in a day, so it makes 60 x 24 = 1440 widgets a day. The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour, so it makes 45 x 24 = 1080 widgets a day.

Now, we need to know how many widgets each machine makes in a month. There are 30 days in a month, so the Widgeteer 3000 makes 1440 x 30 = 43200 widgets in a month. The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 1080 x 30 = 32400 widgets in a month.

Each widget sells for $6, so the Widgeteer 3000 makes 43200 x 6 = $259200 in a month. The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 32400 x 6 = $194400 in a month.

Now, we need to find out how much more money the Widgeteer 3000 makes than the WidgetMaster 9000. We do this by subtracting the money the WidgetMaster 9000 makes from the money the Widgeteer 3000 makes: $259200 - $194400 = $64600.

"Let's break it down. 

Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo. If we call Azibo's points 'x', then Bahati's points will be 'x + 20'. 

Bahati also scored 10 more points than Dinar. If we call Dinar's points 'y', then Bahati's points will be 'y + 10'. 

Since Bahati's points are 'x + 20' and 'y + 10', we can say 'x + 20' is equal to 'y + 10'. 

Now, we know that Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar together scored 45 points. So, we can write the equation: x + (x + 20) + y + 10 = 45.

Combine like terms: 2x + y + 30 = 45.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x + y = 15.

We don't know the value of 'y' yet, but we know that Bahati's points are 'y + 10' and Azibo's points are 'x'. We also know that Bahati scored the most points, so 'y + 10' is greater than 'x'. 

Since 'y + 10' is greater than 'x', we can say 'y' is greater than 'x - 10'. 

Now, we have two equations: 2x + y = 15 and y > x - 10. 

We can try different values of 'x' to find a value that satisfies both equations. 

If x = 5, then 2x = 10 and y = 5. But y is not greater than x - 10. 

If x = 6, then 2x = 12 and y = 3. But y is not greater than x - 10. 

If x = 7, then 2x = 14 and y = 1. But y is not greater than x - 10. 

If x = 8, then 2x = 16 and y = -3. But y is not greater than x - 10. 

If x = 3, then 2x = 6 and y = 9. Here, y is greater than x - 10. 

So, x = 3 and y = 9 satisfy both equations. 

Azibo scored 'x' points, which is 3 points."

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. That's 8 hours. We need to convert 8 hours into minutes. There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so 8 hours is 8 x 60 = 480 minutes.

Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.

She went to sleep at 10 p.m. and woke up at 5:55 a.m. So, she slept for 7 hours and 55 minutes. We need to convert 7 hours and 55 minutes into minutes. 7 hours is 7 x 60 = 420 minutes. 55 minutes is already in minutes. So, 7 hours and 55 minutes is 420 + 55 = 475 minutes.

Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. We need to find out how many minutes she was sleepwalking. 2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. is 23 minutes.

Now, we need to subtract the minutes she was sleepwalking and the minutes she woke up earlier from the total minutes she slept. 475 - 23 - 5 = 447 minutes.

The final answer is: 447"
"Jonathan has 2 dozen cups. 1 dozen is 12, so 2 dozen is 2 x 12 = 24 cups.

Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. So, he has 2/3 x 24 = 16 spoons.

Jonathan gave Pedro 6 spoons. So, he has 16 - 6 = 10 spoons left.

Jonathan still has 24 cups. 

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 24 + 10 = 34."
"To find the number of occupied beds, we need to multiply the total capacity by 1/5. 

1000 * 1/5 = 200

So, 200 beds are occupied. 

Now, we need to find out how many beds are occupied in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 14 days. 

50 patients are admitted each day, so in 14 days, 50 * 14 = 700 patients will be admitted.

Now, we add the initial occupied beds to the beds admitted in 2 weeks. 

200 + 700 = 900

So, the total occupied beds in 2 weeks is 900. 

Now, we need to find the unoccupied beds. The total capacity is 1000, and 900 beds are occupied. 

1000 - 900 = 100

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Robyn sends 16 emails a day. 7 are work emails. 

16 - 7 = 9 emails left. 

Two-thirds of the remainder are to family. Two-thirds of 9 is 6. 

9 - 6 = 3 emails left. 

One-third of the other emails are to her boyfriend. One-third of 3 is 1.

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

"Let's figure this out. If Kelly said Courtney made a mistake and overstated the number of people by 20%, that means the number Courtney said is 20% more than the real number. 

To find 20% of 48, we multiply 48 by 0.2. 

48 * 0.2 = 9.6

So, Courtney overstated the number by 9.6. To find the real number, we need to subtract 9.6 from 48.

48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the real number of people who attended the concert is 38.4."
"Let's figure this out. Jason carried 2 balls. Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball. 

Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried 2 x 2 = 4 balls.

So, the total number of balls carried by the three boys is 2 + 1 + 4 = 7 balls. 

The total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

The pirates dug 10 holes the first day. 

On the second day, they dug 13 holes. So, the total number of holes after the second day is 10 + 13 = 23 holes.

On the third day, they dug 8 holes, but they filled in 2 holes. So, the total number of holes after the third day is 23 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes.

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Four times the number of holes at the end of the first day is 4 x 10 = 40 holes.

So, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 40. We already know that there were 29 holes at the end of the third day. 

To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we need to subtract the number of holes at the end of the third day from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day. 

40 - 29 = 11

The pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

"Let's say the number of corn chips Amora and Lainey got is x. 

Since Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others, Collins got x + 15 corn chips.

We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, so x = 70.

Now, we know Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

The total number of corn chips is the sum of what Amora, Lainey, and Collins got. 

Total = x + x + (x + 15)
Total = 70 + 70 + 85
Total = 225

The final answer is: 225"
"Jen has to pay $400 for supplies. The travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. 

50% of $400 is 0.5 x 400 = 200.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Let's say Adelwolfe has caught x Pokemon. 

Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe, so Stan has caught 4x - 13 Pokemon. 

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so Alex has caught (4x - 13) + 5 Pokemon. 

Together they have caught 339 Pokemon, so we can write an equation: x + (4x - 13) + ((4x - 13) + 5) = 339.

Combine like terms: x + 4x - 13 + 4x - 13 + 5 = 339.

Combine like terms again: 9x - 21 = 339.

Add 21 to both sides: 9x = 360.

Divide both sides by 9: x = 40.

So Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokemon. 

Stan has caught 4x - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 Pokemon.

"The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour.  To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time.  30 miles per hour * 10 hours = 300 miles.

Then, the bird flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour.  To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time.  18 miles per hour * 2 hours = 36 miles.

The bird is now 36 miles north of her southern home.  To get to her southern home, she needs to cover this distance.  But she flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour.  To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time.  22 miles per hour * 5 hours = 110 miles.

The bird is now 110 miles south of the point where she turned back.  To find the total distance between her northern and southern homes, we add the distance she traveled south and the distance she traveled north.  300 miles - 36 miles = 264 miles.  Then, we add 264 miles + 110 miles = 374 miles.

"Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so his brother is 8 x 2 = 16 years old. 

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, so we need to find 25% of 8. 25% is the same as 1/4, so 1/4 of 8 is 8 / 4 = 2. 

So, Nani's sister is 8 - 2 = 6 years old.

Now, we add up the ages of all three family members: Nani (8) + brother (16) + sister (6) = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's count how many racquets Andy has to string with each type of string. 

He has 3 racquets to string with synthetic gut. It takes 15 minutes to string each one, so that's 3 x 15 = 45 minutes.

He has 4 racquets to string with hybrid sets. It takes 18 minutes to string each one, so that's 4 x 18 = 72 minutes.

Now, let's add up all the minutes it takes to string all the racquets. 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes.

So, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all the racquets.

"To find out how many wooden slats Robert needs, we need to find out how many feet of fencing he needs to build. He needs to build a fence around his garden, so we need to add the length and width of the garden and multiply it by 2 (because there are two sides). 

Length of the garden: 15 feet
Width of the garden: 10 feet

Total length of fencing needed: 15 + 15 + 10 + 10 = 50 feet

Now, we need to multiply the total length of fencing by 2 (because there are two sides) and then multiply it by 2 (because he needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing).

Total length of fencing: 50 feet
Number of wood slats per foot: 2

Total number of wood slats needed: 50 * 2 * 2 = 200

First, let's add up the cost of the books: 
$18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (cookbook) = $39

Tyler already has $14, so he needs $39 - $14 = $25 more.

Since he earns $5 per hour, we can divide the amount he needs ($25) by his hourly wage ($5) to find out how many hours he needs to work:
$25 ÷ $5 = 5

On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

Now, let's find out how much money Sunny made on Saturday. He sold 10 boxes of gingerbread for $6 each, so he made 10 x 6 = $60 from gingerbread. He sold 11 boxes of apple pie for $15 each, so he made 11 x 15 = $165 from apple pie. In total, he made $60 + $165 = $225 on Saturday.

On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of gingerbread for $6 each, so he made 15 x 6 = $90 from gingerbread. He sold 15 boxes of apple pie for $15 each, so he made 15 x 15 = $225 from apple pie. In total, he made $90 + $225 = $315 on Sunday.

Emil is 19 now. When he turns 24, he will be 24 - 19 = 5 years older. 

When Emil turns 24, his dad will be half his age, so his dad's age will be 24 / 2 = 12 years older than Emil's age at that time. 

So, his dad's age when Emil turns 24 will be 24 + 12 = 36 years old. 

Now, we know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. So, his brother's age at that time will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old. 

Now, we need to find out their current ages. Emil's current age is 19, and his brother's current age is 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

First, we need to convert the space between the plants to feet. 1.5 feet is the same as 18 inches.  We need to convert the length of the flower bed to inches. 111 feet is the same as 1332 inches. 

Now we can find the total space for plants. 1332 inches - 18 inches = 1314 inches. 

Now we need to find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed.  We need to divide the total space for plants by the space each plant takes.  12 inches is the space each plant takes.  1314 / 12 = 109.5.  We can't have half a plant, so we round down to 109 plants.

She can peel 6 shrimp a minute, so it will take her 30 / 6 = 5 minutes to peel the remaining 30 shrimp.

After peeling, she has to cook the 90 shrimp. She can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so she can cook 90 shrimp in 3 times 10 minutes, which is 30 minutes.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. This means it goes to Greece for 3/4 of its flights and to France and Germany for 1/4 of its flights. Since it goes to France and Germany equally, it goes to each of those countries for 1/4 / 2 = 1/8 of its flights.

The second plane goes to Poland for all its flights, and it makes 44 trips. Since the second plane makes half the number of trips the first plane makes, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

Now, we know the first plane makes 88 trips. It goes to Greece for 3/4 of its flights, which is 3/4 * 88 = 66 trips. It goes to France and Germany for 1/4 of its flights, which is 1/4 * 88 = 22 trips. Since it goes to France and Germany equally, it goes to France for 1/2 of 22 trips, which is 11 trips.

The total age of Helene and Wilfred is 20 - 7 = 13. Since Helene is 10 years old, Wilfred's age is 13 - 10 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"Walter's neighbors gave him $500. Then he got $1500 from the online fund. So, he has $500 + $1500 = $2000. 

His friend gave him $200, but we don't need to add that to the total because we are only counting what Walter's neighbors and the online fund gave. 

Walter's lawyer is going to give three times as much as everyone else. Everyone else is Walter's neighbors and the online fund, so we need to add their money together. $500 + $1500 = $2000. 

Three times $2000 is $2000 x 3 = $6000. 

The final answer is: $6000"
"There were 100 guests at the wedding. Each guest brought 15 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is 100 x 15 = 1500 cookies. The bride gave 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door. 1/2 of 1500 is 750 cookies. If each person in the church got 15 cookies, then the number of people in the church is 750 / 15 = 50.

"Let's say the kids get 1 slice each. Since each adult gets 2 slices, they get 2 slices. 

If there are 4 kids, they get 4 slices. 

The adults get 2 slices each, so they get 2 x 2 = 4 slices. 

In total, there are 4 + 4 = 8 slices. 

The adults get 4 slices out of 8. 

To find the percentage, we divide 4 by 8 and multiply by 100. 

4 / 8 = 0.5 

0.5 x 100 = 50 

So, each adult gets 50% of the watermelon.

"Doctor Jones works 9 hours at the clinic. He has to do rounds for 10 inpatients, and each round takes 20 minutes. So, he will spend 10 x 20 = 200 minutes on rounds. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 200 minutes is 200 / 60 = 3.33 hours. 

He also has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes. So, he will spend 10 x 30 = 300 minutes on appointments. 300 minutes is 300 / 60 = 5 hours.

In total, he will spend 3.33 + 5 = 8.33 hours on rounds and appointments. So, he will have 9 - 8.33 = 0.67 hours left to update his records.

The final answer is: 0.67"
"To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up all the time it takes to make the cake. 

First, we add the time to make the cake batter and bake the cake: 20 minutes + 30 minutes = 50 minutes.

Then, we add the time it takes to cool the cake: 50 minutes + 2 hours = 2 hours 50 minutes.

Now, we add the time it takes to frost the cake: 2 hours 50 minutes + 10 minutes = 3 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 3 hours is 3 x 60 = 180 minutes. So, 3 hours is 180 minutes.

Now we add 180 minutes to the time we want to serve the cake: 180 minutes + 60 minutes (for 5:00 pm) = 240 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 240 minutes by 60: 240 / 60 = 4 hours.

So, Jordan can start making the cake at 1:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

The final answer is: 1:00 pm"
"Let's say there are x chocolate bars in a box. Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars. Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars. We know they sold 64 chocolate bars together, so 8x = 64. 

To find x, we need to divide both sides by 8. x = 64 / 8 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the earnings of the dance studio, we need to know how much they earn per week and then multiply it by 4 (since there are 4 weeks in a month).

First, let's find out how much they earn per session. They charge $1.50 per student and there are 10 students, so that's 10 x $1.50 = $15. 

Then, they have to pay $25 to rent the studio. So, the total cost per session is $15 (for the students) + $25 (rent) = $40.

They rent the studio 3 days a week, so they have 3 sessions per week. 

Now, let's find out how much they earn per week. They have 3 sessions per week and each session earns them $40, so that's 3 x $40 = $120 per week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly earnings by 4 to get the monthly earnings. $120 x 4 = $480.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's figure this out. Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, and he has a total of 64 chocolate bars. So, we can divide 64 by 4 to find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes.

64 ÷ 4 = 16

So, Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.

Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, and she has a total of 56 chocolate bars. We can divide 56 by 7 to find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Martha's boxes.

56 ÷ 7 = 8

So, Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

Now, we need to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha. We can do this by subtracting the number of chocolate bars Martha has in each box from the number of chocolate bars Peter has in each box.

16 - 8 = 8

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha."
"Let's break it down. 

First, we need to find out how many female porcupines there are. We know that the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population. 

Total population = 50
Number of female porcupines = 3/5 * 50 = 30

Now, we know that each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. There are 12 months in a year, so each female porcupine will give birth to 4 * 12 = 48 babies in a year.

Since there are 30 female porcupines, the total number of babies born in a year will be 30 * 48 = 1440.

Now, we add the number of babies born to the initial population of porcupines. 

Initial population = 50
Babies born in a year = 1440
Total population after a year = 50 + 1440 = 1490

The final answer is: 1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = width x length x depth
Volume = 14 x 25 x 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Now, we need to multiply the volume by 5.9 to find out how many gallons of water they need.

Gallons = Volume x 5.9
Gallons = 1400 x 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon, so we need to multiply the gallons by the cost per gallon.

Cost = Gallons x cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 x 0.10
Cost = 826

The final answer is: $826"
"Let's count the sticks. We have 9 red sticks. The blue sticks are 5 more than the red sticks, so we have 9 + 5 = 14 blue sticks. The yellow sticks are 3 less than the blue sticks, so we have 14 - 3 = 11 yellow sticks. 

To find the total number of sticks, we add the red, blue, and yellow sticks together: 9 + 14 + 11 = 34.

Shandy's speed is 45 miles per hour and he traveled for 10 hours. 

45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles

To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled.

"Let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old. So, half of 3000 is 3000 / 2 = 1500 students are over 16 years old.

Now, one-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male. So, one-fourth of 1500 is 1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16 years old.

This means that the remaining students over 16 years old are female. So, 1500 - 375 = 1125 female students are over 16 years old.

Now, the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old. So, half of 3000 is 3000 / 2 = 1500 students are under 16 years old.

One-half of the students under 16 are male. So, one-half of 1500 is 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16 years old.

This means that the remaining students under 16 years old are female. So, 1500 - 750 = 750 female students are under 16 years old.

Now, we add the number of female students over 16 years old and under 16 years old to get the total number of female students. 1125 + 750 = 1875.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. To do that, we need to subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run. 

Bethany can run 10 laps and Quinn can run 5 laps, so Bethany can run 10 - 5 = 5 more laps than Quinn.

"Let's break it down step by step.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. 

Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

So, on the first day, the total amount of water in the tank is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

So, on the second day, the total amount of water in the tank is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water in the tank after two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, so the remaining amount of water needed to fill the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

When Maria's power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour for 5 hours, the remaining charge would be 91% of the original charge. 

After 5 hours, the charge remaining would be 91% of the original charge. 

Then, for the next 3 hours, the power bank was losing 7% of the total capacity each hour. The charge remaining after 3 hours would be 93% of the 91% charge. 

So, the charge remaining after 8 hours would be 0.93 * 0.91 = 0.8463 or 84.63% of the original charge. 

Since the charge remaining at the end was 28%, we can set up an equation to find the original charge. 

Let x be the original charge. 

0.8463x = 0.28x + 0.28 

0.8463x - 0.28x = 0.28 

0.5663x = 0.28 

x = 0.28 / 0.5663 

x = 0.494 

x = 49.4% 

The charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 49.4%."

5 apples cost 5 x $.75 = $3.75

Adding all the money Jamaar spent, we get $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar had $10, so he has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Plums cost $.25 each. To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to divide the money he has left by the cost of one plum.

40% of 60 is easy questions. To find 40% of 60, we multiply 60 by 0.4. 60 x 0.4 = 24. So, there are 24 easy questions.

Since the rest of the questions are equally divided as average and difficult, we divide the remaining questions by 2. There are 60 - 24 = 36 questions left. 36 / 2 = 18. So, there are 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions. 75% of 24 is 0.75 x 24 = 18. So, Aries is sure to get 18 easy questions.

Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones. If each small one costs $4, then each large one costs $4 x 3 = $12.

She sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones. Let's say she sold x large stuffed animals. Then she sold 2x small stuffed animals.

She earned $120 from the sales. The money she made from selling large stuffed animals is $12x and the money she made from selling small stuffed animals is $4(2x). 

So, the total money she made is $12x + $8x = $20x. We know this is equal to $120.

$20x = $120

To find x, we divide both sides by 20.

x = $120 / $20

One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. He can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day. 

He can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe. 50% of 24 is 12, so he can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds per day with a steel pickaxe.

First, there's a 50% chance that the substitute teacher won't collect the homework. If that happens, Marcus won't have to turn it in. 

The other 50% chance is that the normal teacher will come in. If that happens, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. If she does, Marcus won't have to turn it in. 

So, if the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance Marcus won't have to turn it in. 

But if the normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. This means there's a 60% chance (100% - 40%) that he won't get an extension. 

So, if the normal teacher comes in, there's a 60% chance Marcus won't get an extension. 

Now, we need to find the chance that the normal teacher comes in and Marcus doesn't get an extension. This is 50% (chance the normal teacher comes in) * 60% (chance he doesn't get an extension) = 30%.

So, the chance that Marcus won't have to turn in his homework is 50% (substitute teacher) + 30% (normal teacher and no extension) = 80%.

To find the chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we subtract this from 100%: 100% - 80% = 20%.

75 x 3 = 225 small beans. 

But we also know that Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans. So, he can eat 75 x 2 medium-sized beans. 

75 x 2 = 150 medium-sized beans. 

Now, we know that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. So, if Grandpa can eat 150 medium-sized beans, he can eat 150 x 3 small beans.

But we already know that Grandpa can eat 225 small beans. We need to find out how many small beans he can eat. 

Let's think about it. If eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean, and Grandpa can eat 150 medium-sized beans, then he can eat 150 x 3 small beans. But we also know that he can eat 225 small beans.

If 225 small beans is the same as 150 medium-sized beans, then 450 small beans is the same as 300 medium-sized beans. 

But we know that 450 small beans is the same as 150 medium-sized beans. And 225 small beans is the same as 150 medium-sized beans. 

This means that 225 small beans is half of 450 small beans. 

So, if 225 small beans is the same as 150 medium-sized beans, then 450 small beans is the same as 300 medium-sized beans. And 225 small beans is half of 450 small beans. 

This means that 225 small beans is half of 450 small beans.

"Melissa gets paid $15 per day. She has to pay $3 for parking each day. So, she gets $15 - $3 = $12 per day. 

She spends 6 hours a day for 3 days. So, she works 6 * 3 = 18 hours. 

To find out how much she makes per hour, we need to divide her total pay by the number of hours she works. She gets $12 per day for 3 days, so she gets $12 * 3 = $36. 

$36 / 18 hours = $2 per hour. 

The final answer is: $2"
"Ted starts with $200. He buys 3 books for 16 dollars each, so that's 3 x 16 = 48 dollars. He also buys 3 pencils for 6 dollars each, so that's 3 x 6 = 18 dollars. To find out how much he spent in total, we add the money he spent on books and pencils. 48 + 18 = 66. 

The final answer is: 66"
"To find out how many bottles of soda Richard can put on his driveway, we need to divide the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle. 

24 feet (driveway width) / 3 feet (distance between each bottle) = 8 bottles

Since it takes 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we need to multiply the number of bottles by the time it takes to go to each one.

8 bottles * 5 seconds = 40 seconds

So, it will take Richard 40 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

40"
"Uncle Franky has 40 apples in one box. He has two boxes, so he has 40 x 2 = 80 apples. He wants to put 8 apples in one pack. To find out how many packs he can make, we need to divide the total number of apples by 8.

80 ÷ 8 = 10

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples."
"Let's do the math. 

Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese for $11 per pound. So, 2 x 11 = 22 dollars for Parmesan cheese. 

Amor buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese for $6 per pound. So, 3 x 6 = 18 dollars for mozzarella cheese. 

Total money spent on cheese is 22 + 18 = 40 dollars. 

Amor starts with 50 dollars. So, she will have 50 - 40 = 10 dollars left to buy meat.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Jim gets $25,000 a year before college. He goes to college for 4 years, so he loses 4 years of income. That's 4 x $25,000 = $100,000.

He gets $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years, so that's 4 x $50,000 = $200,000.

He earns $50,000 more per year after college because his degree tripled his income. So, his new income is $25,000 + $50,000 = $75,000 per year.

He needs to pay back $200,000 in loans and $100,000 in lost income. That's a total of $300,000.

To find out how long it will take him to earn this money, we need to divide the total amount by his new income. 

$300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.

So, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"To find out how much fabric Jim needs, we need to find the area of the two pieces of fabric. 

First, we need to find the area of one piece of fabric. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide, but the fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider. So, the fabric will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet long and 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.

The area of one piece of fabric is length times width, so it's 8 x 10 = 80 square feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, he needs 2 x 80 = 160 square feet of fabric.

The final answer is: 160"
"Let's break it down step by step.

On Monday, they delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 
So, they delivered 204 + 5 = 209 letters on Wednesday.

Now, let's add up the letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday: 
425 + 102 + 209 = 736

The final answer is: 736"
"To find the total amount Molly will pay, we need to find out how much the chicken salad and pasta salad cost. 

First, we find the cost of the chicken salad: 10 people * $6.50 per person = $65. 

Next, we find the cost of the pasta salad: 6 people * $6 per person = $36.

Now, we add the cost of the chicken salad and pasta salad together: $65 + $36 = $101.

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, Johnny's dad lost $5 in the first race. 

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, he lost $5 in the first race. Twice that is 2 x 5 = 10. Then, he won $1 more than that, so he won 10 + 1 = 11 dollars.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he won 11 dollars in the second race. 1.5 times that is 1.5 x 11 = 16.5 dollars. 

So, he lost 16.5 dollars in the third race.

Now, let's add up all the money he lost and won. He lost 5 dollars in the first race, won 11 dollars in the second race, and lost 16.5 dollars in the third race. 

5 - 11 + (-16.5) = -22.5

To find the average, we need to divide the total by the number of races. There were 3 races. 

-22.5 / 3 = -7.5

The final answer is: -7.5"
"There are 26 countries in South America. Each country has 5 cities. Each city has 1000 people. 

To find the total number of people in one country, we multiply the number of cities by the number of people in each city. 

5 cities * 1000 people = 5000 people in one country.

To find the total number of people in South America, we multiply the number of countries by the number of people in one country.

26 countries * 5000 people = 130,000 people.

The final answer is: 130,000"
"Let's figure this out. Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. First, we need to change feet to inches because Cole's height is in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so Xavier was 4 x 12 = 48 inches tall. Then, Xavier grew 3 inches, so now he is 48 + 3 = 51 inches tall.

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches, so now he is 50 + 2 = 52 inches tall.

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height. To do that, we subtract Xavier's height from Cole's height: 52 - 51 = 1.

The final answer is: 1"
"Let's say the first person took x dollars. 

The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person took x + 80 dollars.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + 80) dollars.

We know that the total amount is $1920, so we can write an equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine like terms again:

4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:

4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 420

The first person took $420."
"First, we need to find out how many days are in 3 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is 3 x 7 = 21 days.

Now, we know the painters worked 3/8ths of a day every day. To find out how many hours that is, we need to know how many hours are in a day. There are 24 hours in a day.

3/8 of 24 hours is the same as 3 x 24 / 8. First, we multiply 3 and 24, which is 72. Then we divide 72 by 8, which is 9.

So, each day, the painters worked 9 hours. Now, we multiply the hours they worked each day by the number of days they worked, which is 21. 9 x 21 is 189.

Now, we need to find out how many hours each painter worked. There are 4 painters, so we divide 189 by 4. 189 / 4 is 47.25.

The final answer is: 47.25"

In the first set, he retrieved x + 4 balls. 
In the third set, he retrieved x / 2 balls. 

We know that the total number of balls he retrieved is 19. So, we can write an equation: x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19.

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying the whole equation by 2: 2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38.

Now, let's simplify the equation: 2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38. 
Combine like terms: 5x + 8 = 38.

Now, let's subtract 8 from both sides: 5x = 30.

Finally, let's divide both sides by 5: x = 6.

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. 

Now, let's find out how many balls he retrieved in the first set: x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for 3 years (2008, 2009, and 2010).

In 2008, the price of the car will be 20000 - (21% of 20000) = 20000 - 4200 = 15800.

In 2009, the price of the car will be 15800 - (21% of 15800) = 15800 - 3328 = 12472.

In 2010, the price of the car will be 12472 - (21% of 12472) = 12472 - 2620.52 = 98451.48.

The price of the car in 2010 is $9845.15"
"Let's break it down. 

There are 50 books in total. Half of them are in English, so that's 50 / 2 = 25 books in English. 

10% of the books are in German. 10% of 50 is 5. So, there are 5 books in German.

Now, we know there are 25 English books and 5 German books. To find out how many Spanish books there are, we need to subtract the English and German books from the total. 

50 (total books) - 25 (English books) - 5 (German books) = 20

So, there are 20 Spanish books.

"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she already drove from the total distance. 

First, let's find out how many kilometers Bernice drove in total. We know she drove 325 kilometers for 4 days. To find the total, we multiply the kilometers she drove each day by the number of days. 

325 kilometers/day * 4 days = 1300 kilometers

Now, we subtract the distance she drove from the total distance. 

Total distance = 1955 kilometers
Distance driven = 1300 kilometers

1955 - 1300 = 655

So Bernice still needs to drive 655 kilometers.

655"
"Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. We need to find out how many cups she drinks in 30 days. 

8 cups per day * 30 days = 240 cups

Now, we need to find out how many gallons that is. There are 16 cups in a gallon. 

240 cups / 16 cups per gallon = 15 gallons

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

"Let's break it down step by step.

Romeo starts with 120 people on the train.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So now, there are 120 + 20 = 140 people on the train.

At the second stop, 50 people get off the train. But then, twice that number (2 x 50 = 100) board the train. So, we subtract 50 and add 100. 140 - 50 + 100 = 190 people on the train.

At the third stop, 80 people get off the train. So, we subtract 80 from 190. 190 - 80 = 110 people on the train.

The final answer is: 110"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, the tank top cost $10. 
The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15. 

The tennis shoes were originally $48, but they were on sale for half price. Half of $48 is $48 / 2 = $24. 

The athletic socks cost $8, and she had a coupon for $2 off, so she paid $8 - $2 = $6 for the socks. 

Now, let's add up all the costs: $10 (tank top) + $15 (shorts) + $24 (shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55. 

The final answer is: $55"
"To find the total cost, we need to find out how many tiles we need. 

First, we need to find the area of one tile. Since it's a square tile, we multiply the length by the width. The length is 1ft and the width is 1ft. 

Area of one tile = length * width = 1 * 1 = 1 SqFt

Now, we need to find out how many tiles we need to cover 200 SqFt. We divide the total area by the area of one tile.

Number of tiles = Total area / Area of one tile = 200 / 1 = 200

Now, we know we need 200 tiles. Each tile costs $12. 

Total cost = Number of tiles * Cost of one tile = 200 * 12 = 2400

The final answer is: $2400"
"James had an accident, so his insurance cost is 60% more than normal. 

First, we need to find 60% of $120. 60% is the same as 60/100 or 0.6. 

0.6 x 120 = 72

So, James has to pay $72 more than normal. 

Now, we add $72 to the normal cost of $120. 

120 + 72 = 192

James has to pay $192 a month. 

To find out how much he pays a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12.

192 x 12 = 2304

The final answer is: 2304"
"Let's break it down. Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king bed. He puts clean sheets on them every week. 

For the twin beds, he has 4 beds, and he can wash 2 at a time. So, he needs to wash 4 / 2 = 2 sets of twin sheets every week. 

For the king bed, he has 1 bed, and he can wash 1 at a time. So, he needs to wash 1 set of king sheets every week.

In total, he needs to wash 2 sets of twin sheets + 1 set of king sheets = 3 sets of sheets every week.

There are 52 weeks in a year. So, he needs to wash 3 sets of sheets per week for 52 weeks. 

3 sets/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 sets/year

Since he can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, we need to find out how many of these combinations he can do in a year. 

2 twin sets + 1 king set = 3 sets. 

156 sets/year / 3 sets/load = 52 loads/year

Last year, he collected 50 stickers. So, he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers at the end of last year.

This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year. He collected 50 stickers last year, so this year he collected 2 x 50 = 100 stickers.

Now, we add the stickers he collected this year to the stickers he had at the end of last year. 150 + 100 = 250 stickers.

The answer is 250."

"Let's break it down. 

We know Becky ate 10 slices. Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake did. So, Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake did. So, Silvia ate 2 x 7 = 14 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices they ate. Becky ate 10 slices, Jake ate 7 slices, and Silvia ate 14 slices. 

10 + 7 + 14 = 31

The total number of slices they ate is 31."

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80. 

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40. 

So Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

The final answer is 58."
"First, we need to find out how much the doctor visit costs. The doctor charges $300/hour and the visit is 30 minutes. We need to convert 30 minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 30 minutes is 30/60 = 0.5 hours. 

Now we multiply the cost per hour by the number of hours: $300 * 0.5 = $150. 

Next, we need to add the cost of the cast, which is $200. 

Then we need to add the cost of the painkillers. The doctor gives 30 painkillers and each one costs $4. So, 30 * $4 = $120.

Lastly, we need to add the cost of parking. The doctor charges $6/hour and the minimum is 2 hours. So, 2 * $6 = $12.

He has 700 small coupons and 1400 big coupons, so he has a total of 700 + 1400 = 2100 coupons.

Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, and each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail. So the total cost for small coupons is 700 x 5 cents = 3500 cents. The total cost for big coupons is 1400 x 15 cents = 21000 cents.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of small coupons and big coupons. 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

To make it easier to understand, we can convert cents to dollars. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so 24500 cents is 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

"Dennis needs 6 dozen croissants, and he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. So, he needs 6 pounds of butter. 

The grocery store has a promotion where if you buy one pound of butter, you get one half off. This means that for every pound of butter, you pay half the price and get the other half free. 

The price of one pound of butter is $4.00. If you buy one pound, you pay $4.00, and if you buy another pound, you pay $2.00 (half of $4.00). 

So, for 6 pounds of butter, Dennis will pay $4.00 for the first pound, $2.00 for the second pound, $2.00 for the third pound, $2.00 for the fourth pound, $2.00 for the fifth pound, and $2.00 for the sixth pound. 

$4.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 = $12.00

The first and second monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas each day. 

If Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough for a week, then we need to find out how many bananas are eaten in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so the total bananas eaten in a week is 315. 

Now, we know that the first and second monkeys eat 24 bananas each day. So, in a week, they eat 24 x 7 = 168 bananas. 

The third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day, which is 315 - 168 = 147 bananas. 

But this is for a week, not a day. To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to divide 147 by 7.

But she can also buy a dozen roses for $15, and that's 12 roses. So, she can buy 12 roses for $15 and 3 more roses for $2 each. That will be 12 + 3 = 15 roses. 

So, she will pay 15 x 2 = 30 dollars for 15 roses. 

She has 5 x 5 = 25 dollars. She will pay 30 dollars, so she will have 25 - 30 = -5 dollars left. But she can't have negative dollars, so she must have borrowed some money or used a different payment method. 

Let's think about it another way. If she buys a dozen roses for $15, that's 12 roses. She still needs 3 more roses. 3 roses will be 3 x 2 = 6 dollars. So, she will pay 15 + 6 = 21 dollars for 15 roses. 

She has 5 x 5 = 25 dollars. She will pay 21 dollars, so she will have 25 - 21 = 4 dollars left. 

Now, let's think about the change. She has 4 dollars left and she paid with 5 dollar bills. She must have used one 5 dollar bill and 4 dollars in quarters. 4 dollars in quarters is 4 / 0.25 = 16 quarters.

The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the amount of time that the first train stayed in the station. The first train stayed for 20 minutes, so the second train will stay for 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. The second train will leave the station in 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station. Since the second train leaves the station in 65 minutes, the third train will arrive in 65 + 60 = 125 minutes.

The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it will leave in 125 minutes.

The fourth train will arrive 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station. Since the third train leaves the station in 125 minutes, the fourth train will arrive in 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

She needs 200 toothpicks in total. To find out how many more toothpicks she needs, we subtract the number of toothpicks she already saved from the total number of toothpicks she needs.

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week, to find out how many weeks it will take her to collect the remaining toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she needs by the number of toothpicks she saves each week.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

Now, James walked back home, which is the same distance, 4 miles. It took him 1 hour to walk to the store, so it will take him 1 hour to walk back home.

"Let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that half of the bikes sold were Trekking bikes. Since there were 300 bikes sold, half of them would be 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

Next, we know that 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes. 15% of 300 is 0.15 x 300 = 45 BMX bikes.

Now, we know that the rest of the bikes were MTB. We already know that 150 were Trekking and 45 were BMX, so the number of MTB bikes sold would be 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

We know the price of each type of bike: MTB is $500, BMX is half the price of MTB, so BMX is $500 / 2 = $250, and Trekking is $450.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:
- MTB: 105 bikes x $500 = $52,500
- BMX: 45 bikes x $250 = $11,250
- Trekking: 150 bikes x $450 = $67,500

Now, let's add up the total earnings from all types of bikes:

He goes to class for 5 days a week, so he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes in class each week.

Now, he spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. There are 7 days in a week, so there are 7 * 24 * 60 = 16800 minutes in a week.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 2650 / 60 = 44.17 hours.

The final answer is: 44.17"
"Nathan drops the ball from the third-floor balcony. The third floor is 24 feet high. So, the ball goes down 24 feet and then bounces up. 

The ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height. So, on the first bounce, it goes up 2/3 * 24 = 16 feet. 

Now, it goes down 16 feet and then bounces up again. On the second bounce, it goes up 2/3 * 16 = 10.67 feet.

The answer is: 10.67"
"Let's figure this out step by step. 

The first child is 6 feet tall. We need to convert feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot. So, the first child is 6 x 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child. So, the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child. So, the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child. So, the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to know how many bags of apples they sold. Since they sold 2000 apples and each bag has 10 apples, we can divide 2000 by 10 to find out how many bags they sold.

2000 ÷ 10 = 200

So, the orchard sold 200 bags of apples. 

Now, we need to find out how much they earned. We know they sold each bag for $5. To find the total amount they earned, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. Before that, the velociraptors ate half of what was left. So, the velociraptors ate half of 270 kilograms, which is 270 / 2 = 135 kilograms. 

Now, the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, and the velociraptors ate 135 kilograms. So, the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, and then the velociraptors ate half of what was left. This means the velociraptors ate half of half of the triceratops, which is 1/4 of the triceratops. 

If 135 kilograms is 1/4 of the triceratops, then the whole triceratops would be 135 * 4 = 540 kilograms.

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how much paint Tony needs, we need to find the total area of the walls. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall is 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. There are two walls, so 2 x 80 = 160 square feet. 

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall is 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. There are two walls, so 2 x 40 = 80 square feet.

Now, we add the area of all the walls together: 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need to divide the total area by 20 to find out how many gallons of paint we need: 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon: 12 x 12 = $144.

The answer is: $144"
"Let's break it down step by step. Ellen started with 12 sodas, 3 of which were shaken. She took 1 unshaken soda for herself, so there are 11 sodas left. Her brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, so there are 2 shaken sodas and 8 unshaken sodas left. Now, Ellen's friend has 2 chances out of 10 to get a shaken soda. 

To find the likelihood, we need to divide the number of shaken sodas by the total number of sodas and multiply by 100. 

2 / 10 = 0.2
0.2 * 100 = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's think about this. If one train is going 60 miles an hour, and the other train is going half that distance, that means the other train is going 60 / 2 = 30 miles an hour.

So, after 1 hour, the first train will be 60 miles away from the station, and the other train will be 30 miles away from the station.

After 2 hours, the first train will be 60 x 2 = 120 miles away from the station, and the other train will be 30 x 2 = 60 miles away from the station.

After 3 hours, the first train will be 60 x 3 = 180 miles away from the station, and the other train will be 30 x 3 = 90 miles away from the station.

Since they are moving in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they traveled. So, the total distance between them is 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"First, we need to find out how many days Billy works. March has 31 days and April has 19 days, so 31 + 19 = 50 days. But Billy takes 20% of the days off. 20% of 50 is 10. So, he takes 10 days off. 

50 - 10 = 40 days. That's how many days Billy works. 

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day. So, he can help 2 x 3 = 6 people per day.

40 days * 6 people per day = 240 people.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find out how many people were inside the church, we need to know how many people were outside the church. We know there were 20 private cars and 12 buses. 

First, let's find out how many people were in the buses. Each bus carried 35 people, and there were 12 buses. So, 12 * 35 = 420 people were in the buses.

Next, let's find out how many people were in the private cars. Each car carried 3 people, and there were 20 cars. So, 20 * 3 = 60 people were in the private cars.

Now, we add the people in the buses and the private cars to find out how many people were outside the church. 420 + 60 = 480 people were outside the church.

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the number of people outside the church from the total number of people. But we don't know the total number of people. 

However, we can assume that the total number of people is the sum of the people in the buses and the private cars, plus the people inside the church. Let's call the number of people inside the church 'x'. Then, the total number of people is 480 + x.

The total number of people is also equal to the sum of the people in the buses and the private cars. So, 480 + x = 420 + 60.

Now, we can solve for x. 480 + x = 480. 

x = 0

The final answer is: 0"

"To find out how long it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed. 

For the biggest slide: 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes
For the second biggest slide: 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we need to find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide. 

5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

"To find out how many hours Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to, we need to first find out how many minutes he takes for lunch and breaks in a day. 

Bobby takes a 30 min lunch and 2 breaks of 15 minutes each. So, his breaks are 2 x 15 = 30 minutes. 

In total, he takes 30 + 30 = 60 minutes for lunch and breaks in a day. 

Now, we need to find out how many minutes he takes in 5 days. 60 minutes x 5 days = 300 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 300 / 60 = 5 hours.

So, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours after 5 days. 

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's figure this out. 

Amber ran 8 miles. Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so we multiply 8 by 3.5. 8 x 3.5 = 28. 

So, Micah ran 28 miles. 

Now, we know that Amber and Micah ran 8 + 28 = 36 miles together. 

We know that they ran a total of 52 miles. To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we need to subtract the miles Amber and Micah ran from the total miles. 

52 - 36 = 16.

So, Ahito ran 16 miles.

"Let's break it down step by step.

Sheila started with $85.00 on her credit card. She returned one item that cost $15.00, so we subtract that from $85.00.

$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Now, she bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply $20.00 by 20% (which is 0.20).

$20.00 x 0.20 = $4.00

So the frying pan cost $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

She also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we multiply $30.00 by 10% (which is 0.10).

$30.00 x 0.10 = $3.00

So the towels cost $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

Now, we add the cost of the frying pan and the towels to the new balance on her credit card.

$70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

The new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. This means 1/3 of the large jellyfish change color. 

We also know that 6 jellyfish changed color. Since 1/3 of the large jellyfish change color, we can say that 6 jellyfish is 1/3 of the large jellyfish. 

To find out how many large jellyfish there are, we can multiply 6 by 3. 

6 * 3 = 18

So, there are 18 large jellyfish. 

Now, we know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large. This means 1/5 of the jellyfish are large. We can say that 18 jellyfish is 1/5 of the total jellyfish. 

To find out how many jellyfish there are in total, we can multiply 18 by 5. 

18 * 5 = 90

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

The final answer is: 90"

"Lauren is saving 20% of her salary, so she saves 0.2 x 100,000 = 20,000 dollars every year. 

She wants to live on 40% of her current salary, so she will need 0.4 x 100,000 = 40,000 dollars every year for 20 years.

40,000 x 20 = 800,000 dollars. 

Lauren saves 20,000 dollars every year, so to find out how many years she needs to work, we divide 800,000 by 20,000.

800,000 / 20,000 = 40 years.

Lauren already worked for 0 years, so she needs to work 40 - 0 = 40 more years.

"Let's figure this out. If 40% of the school is boys and there are 240 boys, we need to find out what 100% is. 

To do that, we can use a simple math trick. If 40% is 240, then 100% will be 240 divided by 40, and then multiplied by 100. 

First, divide 240 by 40: 240 ÷ 40 = 6. 

Then, multiply 6 by 100: 6 x 100 = 600.

So, the total number of students in the school is 600. 

Now, we need to find out how many girls are in the school. If 40% are boys, then 60% are girls. We can find 60% of 600 by multiplying 600 by 60 and then dividing by 100.

First, multiply 600 by 60: 600 x 60 = 36000.

Then, divide 36000 by 100: 36000 ÷ 100 = 360.

So, there are 360 girls in the school.

"To find the average height of heels, we need to add up all the heights and divide by the number of people. 

Three women are wearing 4 inch heels, so their total height is 3 x 4 = 12 inches. 

Three women are wearing 2 inch heels, so their total height is 3 x 2 = 6 inches. 

Now, we add the total heights together: 12 + 6 = 18 inches. 

There are 6 women in total. 

To find the average, we divide the total height by the number of women: 18 / 6 = 3 inches. 

The average height of heels at the party is 3 inches.

"Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in June. June has 30 days. If she hikes 125 miles twice a day, that's 2 x 125 = 250 miles per day. To find out how many days she needs to hike, we divide 9,300 by 250. 9,300 / 250 = 37.2. But June only has 30 days, so she can't hike for 37.2 days. She needs to hike for 30 days. 

Now, let's find out how many miles she will hike in 30 days. 250 miles per day for 30 days is 250 x 30 = 7,500 miles. She wants to hike 9,300 miles, but she will only hike 7,500 miles. To find out how many more miles she needs to hike, we subtract 7,500 from 9,300. 9,300 - 7,500 = 1,800 miles.

Now, let's find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day. She needs to hike 1,800 miles in 30 days. To find out how many miles she needs to hike per day, we divide 1,800 by 30. 1,800 / 30 = 60.

First, we need to find out how many toys the 4 workers who produce 6 toys an hour make in 10 hours. 

4 workers * 6 toys per hour * 10 hours = 240 toys

Then, we need to find out how many toys the 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour make in 10 hours.

2 workers * 4 toys per hour * 10 hours = 80 toys

Now, we add the toys made by both groups of workers.

240 toys + 80 toys = 320 toys

The manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, so the total number of toys made by all 5 workers is 320 + 20 = 340 toys.

Now, we need to find out how many toys the fifth worker makes in 10 hours. 

We know that 4 workers make 240 toys in 10 hours, so the fifth worker makes 340 - 240 = 100 toys in 10 hours.

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. This means Luis got half of Seth's stickers. 

Luis used half of the stickers he got and gave the rest to Kris. This means Kris got half of the stickers Luis had, which is half of half of Seth's stickers. 

Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob. This means Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers. 

Since Kris had half of half of Seth's stickers, we can say Kris had 1/2 * 1/2 * Seth's stickers. 

We know Kris had 16 stickers, so 1/2 * 1/2 * Seth's stickers = 16. 

To find Seth's stickers, we need to do the opposite of 1/2 * 1/2. We can do this by multiplying by 2 twice. 

16 * 2 = 32, then 32 * 2 = 64.

So, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Let's call this number 'x'. 

Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's call the number of eggs Sarah painted 'y'. Then Camden painted y + 12 eggs. 

Since Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, we can write an equation: y + (y + 12) = 30. 

Combine like terms: 2y + 12 = 30. 

Subtract 12 from both sides: 2y = 18. 

Divide both sides by 2: y = 9. 

So Sarah painted 9 eggs. Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs. 

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and Camden painted 21 eggs, we can say that Arnold and Madeline painted 21 eggs each. 

Now, we need to find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold. Camden painted 21 eggs and Arnold painted 21 eggs. 

The difference is 21 - 21 = 0.

The total weight of the crayons is 200 * 1 = 200 ounces. The total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces. 

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 200 + 200 = 400 ounces.

x = 2 / 40
x = 0.05 miles per minute (this is her speed on the beach)

Now, we know her speed on the sidewalk is 2x, which is 2 * 0.05 = 0.1 miles per minute.

Now, let's find the time she takes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk. 
Time = distance / speed
Time = 1 / 0.1
Time = 10 minutes

So, she takes 10 minutes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk. 

Now, let's find the total time she takes to walk 3 miles. 
Time on the beach = 40 minutes
Time on the sidewalk = 10 minutes
Total time = 40 + 10 = 50 minutes

The final answer is: 50"
"Jane saved $4 every week for 8 weeks. That's 8 x 4 = 32 dollars. To get to 60 dollars, she needs 60 - 32 = 28 dollars more. If she saves 4 dollars a week, it will take her 28 / 4 = 7 weeks to save 28 dollars.

"Let's count the blue birds. 

3 trees had 7 blue birds each, so that's 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds. 

2 trees had 4 blue birds each, so that's 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds. 

And 1 tree had 3 blue birds. 

Now, let's add them all together: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 blue birds.

"Let's think about it. Bob has some marbles. If he gets 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. A dozen is 12, so 2 dozen is 2 x 12 = 24. 

So, if he gets 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has now, we need to subtract 24 from 60. 60 - 24 = 36. 

Now, if he loses 10 marbles, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles.

The final answer is: 26"
"Let's think about this. Donny can drink the water when he pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug. This means the water in the other mug must be cold enough to make the average temperature of the water in the bottle 40 degrees.

Let's say the unknown temperature is x. The total amount of water in the bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug). 

The average temperature of the water in the bottle is (33 * 4 + x * 1) / 5 = 40.

We can solve for x by multiplying both sides by 5: 33 * 4 + x * 1 = 40 * 5
132 + x = 200

Now, we subtract 132 from both sides: x = 200 - 132
x = 68

So, the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees.

"Let's count the cows first. Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. There are 7 days in a week, so in 3 weeks, there are 3 x 7 = 21 days. 

20 cows per day for 21 days is 20 x 21 = 420 cows. 

Now, let's count the chickens. Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. 

10 chickens per day for 21 days is 10 x 21 = 210 chickens.

Now, let's add the cows and chickens together. 50 (initial cows) + 420 (new cows) = 470 cows. 20 (initial chickens) + 210 (new chickens) = 230 chickens.

The total number of animals on the farm is 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

The final answer is: 700"
"Let's break it down. 

First, we need to find out how much 4 packs of bagels cost. Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs will cost 4 x $10.00 = $40.00.

Now, we need to find out how much the 10% discount is. 10% of $40.00 is 0.1 x $40.00 = $4.00.

So, the total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Now, we need to find out how many bagels there are in 4 packs. Each pack has 9 bagels, so 4 packs will have 4 x 9 = 36 bagels.

To find out how much each bagel costs, we need to divide the total cost by the number of bagels. So, $36.00 ÷ 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

The final answer is: $1.00"

First, we need to find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. He ate 5 less than 23 scoops, so we need to subtract 5 from 23. 

23 - 5 = 18

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

First, let's find out how many potatoes it takes to make 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes, so we need to subtract 3 from 6. 

6 - 3 = 3

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. Since it takes 3 potatoes to make 3 scoops, we need to divide 3 by 3.

3 / 3 = 1

So, it takes 1 potato to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. We can multiply 1 by 18.

1 * 18 = 18

So, Gomer ate 18 potatoes."
"Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days. That's 3 x 30 = 90 eggs. 

Then, he eats 5 eggs a day for 30 days. That's 5 x 30 = 150 eggs.

So, in total, Chester eats 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is 12 eggs, we need to divide 240 by 12 to get the number of dozens. 

240 / 12 = 20.

"Let's break it down. The ratio of men to women is 5:9. This means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. 

To find the total number of parts in the ratio, we add 5 and 9. 5 + 9 = 14.

Now, we need to find out how many groups of 14 are there in 84. We can do this by dividing 84 by 14. 84 ÷ 14 = 6.

This means there are 6 groups of 14 people. Since the ratio of men to women is 5:9, the number of women in each group is 9. 

So, the total number of women is 6 groups * 9 women per group = 54 women.

Now, 20 women alight from the bus. To find the number of women remaining, we subtract 20 from 54. 54 - 20 = 34.

He earns $26 from sunflowers, and each sunflower costs $2. So, he sold 26 / 2 = 13 sunflowers per day. 

He earns $56 from bouquets, and each bouquet costs $8. So, he sold 56 / 8 = 7 bouquets per day. 

Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, so he sold 7 * 12 = 84 sunflowers from bouquets per day. 

In total, he sold 13 + 84 = 97 sunflowers per day. 

He sold sunflowers for 3 days. So, he sold 97 * 3 = 291 sunflowers in total.

He bought 4 devices last Tuesday, so he sold 4 devices for $40 each, which is 4 x $40 = $160.

He sold devices for $80 on Monday and $160 on Tuesday, so he sold a total of $80 + $160 = $240.

He bought devices for $20 each, so he bought 2 + 4 = 6 devices. 6 devices cost $20 each, which is 6 x $20 = $120.

Now, we multiply the number of people by the number of bottles needed per person: 2300 people * 5 bottles/person = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles they need to produce to reach 11500 bottles. 

To do this, we subtract the number of bottles they can produce from the number of bottles needed: 11500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 7300 bottles.

First, we know the first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each. So, the total number of apartments in the first two complexes is 200 + 200 = 400.

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined. To find 60% of 400, we multiply 400 by 0.6. 400 x 0.6 = 240. So, the last complex has 240 more apartments than the other two combined. To find the total number of apartments in the last complex, we add 240 to 400. 400 + 240 = 640.

Now, we know the total number of apartments in all three complexes is 400 + 640 = 1040.

A 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits. 
A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, so it produces 3 x 50 = 150 fruits. 
A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, so it produces 7 x 50 = 350 fruits. 
An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We don't know how many a 10-year-old tree produces yet, but we can call it 'x'. So, an 8-year-old tree produces x - 200 fruits. 
A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits. 
A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, so it produces 20 x 50 = 1000 fruits. 

Now we know that an 8-year-old tree produces x - 200 fruits, and a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits. Since an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, we can say x - 200 = 1000. 

To find x, we add 200 to both sides of the equation: x = 1000 + 200 = 1200. 

So, a 10-year-old tree produces 1200 fruits. 
An 8-year-old tree produces 1200 - 200 = 1000 fruits. 
A 7-year-old tree produces 350 fruits.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. So, if we say the yellow rope is y, then the blue rope is y - 7.

The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope. So, the red rope is 4 * (y - 7).

We know the three ropes have a combined length of 37 centimeters. So, we can write an equation: y + (y - 7) + 4 * (y - 7) = 37.

Now, let's simplify the equation: y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37.

Combine like terms: 6y - 35 = 37.

Add 35 to both sides: 6y = 72.

Divide both sides by 6: y = 12.

Now that we know the yellow rope is 12 centimeters, we can find the length of the blue rope: blue rope = y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5.

The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: red rope = 4 * 5 = 20.

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so if Ronnie has $5, Rissa has 3 x 5 = 15 dollars.

After they both gave an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's call the amount they gave 'x'. So, Ronnie is left with 5 - x dollars and Rissa is left with 15 - x dollars.

We know that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can write an equation: 15 - x = (4/5) * 15.

To solve for x, we multiply 15 by 4/5, which is 12. So, 15 - x = 12.

Now, we need to find the value of x. We can do this by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation: x = 15 - 12, x = 3.

So, Ronnie gave 3 dollars to their little sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. We subtract 3 from 5: 5 - 3 = 2.

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, so we can add up the amounts of red, white, purple, and yellow paint to get 12. 

x + x + x + 6 = 12

Combine like terms: 3x + 6 = 12

Subtract 6 from both sides: 3x = 6

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, team A scores 4 goals in the first half. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 x 2 = 8 goals.

Now, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half, which is 1/4 x 8 = 2 goals.

So, in the first half, team A scored 4 goals and team B scored 2 goals. In the second half, team A scored 2 goals and team B scored 8 goals.

To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we add the goals scored by both teams in both halves. 

Total goals scored by team A = 4 + 2 = 6
Total goals scored by team B = 2 + 8 = 10

Total goals scored in the match = 6 + 10 = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. He uses 45% of it on Monday. To find 45% of 5, we multiply 5 by 0.45. 

5 x 0.45 = 2.25 inches

So, the teacher has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches left.

Now, the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day. To find out how many days he has left, we need to divide the remaining chalk by 20% of the original chalk. 

20% of 5 is 1 inch. 

2.75 ÷ 1 = 2.75

So, the teacher has 2.75 days left before he has to recycle the chalk."
"Let's break it down. 

There are 12 boys and 12 girls in the class. 

One-third of the girls are on varsity. To find out how many girls are on varsity, we need to divide 12 by 3. 12 divided by 3 is 4. So, 4 girls are on varsity.

One-fourth of the boys are on varsity. To find out how many boys are on varsity, we need to divide 12 by 4. 12 divided by 4 is 3. So, 3 boys are on varsity.

Now, we need to find out how many students are on varsity in total. We add the number of boys and girls on varsity. 4 girls + 3 boys = 7 students on varsity.

There are 24 students in total (12 boys + 12 girls). To find out how many students are not on varsity, we need to subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students. 24 - 7 = 17.

The final answer is: 17"
"Let's figure this out. Mike bought 5 face masks. Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. 

Thrice as many as Mike means 3 times 5, which is 3 x 5 = 15.

"To find out how much Mr. Marcellus got in refunds, we need to find out how many gallons of milk were bad and then multiply that by the cost per gallon.

First, we need to find out how many gallons of milk were bad. 2/5 of 4000 gallons is bad. 

To find 2/5 of 4000, we can multiply 4000 by 2 and then divide by 5.

4000 x 2 = 8000
8000 / 5 = 1600

So, 1600 gallons of milk were bad. 

Now, we need to multiply the number of bad gallons by the cost per gallon to find the refund amount.

Refund = 1600 x 3.5
Refund = 5600

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Let Colin's current age be x. 

In 7 years, Colin will be x + 7 years old. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be in 7 years, so Wendy's current age is 5(x + 7).

In 25 years, Colin will be x + 25 years old. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now, so x + 25 = (1/3)(5(x + 7)).

Now, let's solve the equation: 
x + 25 = (1/3)(5(x + 7))
x + 25 = (5/3)(x + 7)
3(x + 25) = 5(x + 7)
3x + 75 = 5x + 35
75 - 35 = 5x - 3x
40 = 2x
x = 20

Colin is 20 years old now.

"Let's figure this out. Bob has $27000 to spend on books. He can buy 100 books for $500. 

First, we need to find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy with $27000. To do this, we divide $27000 by $500. 

$27000 ÷ $500 = 54

This means Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books. Now, we need to find out how many books he can buy in total. 

54 sets * 100 books per set = 5400 books

Since Bob is distributing the books to 3 schools, we need to divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books each school will get.

5400 books ÷ 3 schools = 1800 books per school

So, Bob can buy 1800 books per school.

First, we need to find out how many bags of coal Ali ordered. We know he ordered 850 kilos of coal and each bag is 50 kg. 

To find out how many bags, we divide the total kilos by the kilos per bag: 850 ÷ 50 = 17

Now we know Ali ordered 17 bags of coal. Each bag costs $18. 

To find the total cost, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag: 17 x 18 = 306

So, Ali's order costs $306.

"Let's break it down. Kate's 6 friends eat 6 slices of cheese pizza each, so that's 6 x 6 = 36 slices. They also eat 4 slices of pepperoni pizza each, so that's 6 x 4 = 24 slices. 

Now, we need to find out how many cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas Kate needs to buy. Each cheese pizza has 12 slices, so to get 36 slices, Kate needs 36 / 12 = 3 cheese pizzas. Each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, so to get 24 slices, Kate needs 24 / 8 = 3 pepperoni pizzas.

So, Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

3 cheese pizzas + 3 pepperoni pizzas = 6 pizzas"

"Jay can build 20 snowballs in 1 hour. That's 60 minutes. 

He can build 20 snowballs in 60 minutes, so he can build 1 snowball in 3 minutes. 

He can build 1 snowball in 3 minutes, so he can build 20 snowballs in 60 minutes. 

He can build 20 snowballs in 60 minutes, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. That's 4 melts in 60 minutes. 

So, Jay builds 20 snowballs and 4 melt in 60 minutes. That means he has 16 snowballs left after 60 minutes. 

Jay needs 60 snowballs, and he has 16 snowballs after 60 minutes. He needs 44 more snowballs. 

It will take him 2 hours to build 44 more snowballs because 44 divided by 20 is 2.2. We can't have a fraction of an hour, so it will take him 2 hours to build 44 more snowballs.

It will take him 2 hours to build 44 more snowballs, and he already had 16 snowballs. So, it will take him 2 hours and 60 minutes to have 60 snowballs.

"Let's figure this out. If John is 28 now and he was twice as old as Jim when Digimon came out, that means we need to find out how old John was when Digimon came out. 

We don't know exactly when Digimon came out, but we can still solve the problem. Let's say John was x years old when Digimon came out. Since John was twice as old as Jim, Jim was x/2 years old when Digimon came out.

Now, we need to find out how many years have passed since Digimon came out. We know John is 28 now, and we know he was x years old when Digimon came out. So, the number of years that have passed is 28 - x.

We also know that Jim is now x/2 years older than he was when Digimon came out. So, Jim's current age is x/2 + (28 - x). We can simplify this to 28 - x/2.

We are not given the exact year Digimon came out, but we can still solve for x. Since we don't know the exact year, we can say that the number of years that have passed since Digimon came out is the same for both John and Jim. 

So, we can set up the equation: 28 - x = 28 - x/2.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 56 - 2x = 28 - x.

Now, we can add x to both sides: 56 - x = 28.

Next, we can subtract 56 from both sides: -x = -28.

Finally, we can multiply both sides by -1: x = 28.

Now that we know x, we can find Jim's age. Jim's age is 28 - x/2, which is 28 - 28/2. This simplifies to 28 - 14, which is 14.

So, Jim is 14 years old.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50. So, they had 38 + 50 = 88 bandages.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. So, they had 88 - 28 = 60 bandages left.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50, which is 2 x 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, they used 25 bandages on the third day. They had 60 + 100 - 25 = 135 bandages.

They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, they must have had 135 - 78 = 57 bandages before the third day.

Since they ordered one bulk pack on the first day, they must have had 50 bandages before the first day. 

So, they must have had 50 + 57 = 107 bandages on the first day.

Twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 is 2 x 40 = 80. 

So, 80 more people entered the restaurant after a while. 

Now, we have 50 + 40 + 80 = 170 people. 

By evening, 3 times as many people as the number that came in first (50) had entered the restaurant. 

3 times 50 is 150.

Cognac costs 50% more than scotch. 50% of $60 is $30. So, cognac costs $60 + $30 = $90 per bottle.

Now, we find the total cost of cognac: 20 bottles x $90 per bottle = $1800.

"To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we need to first find out how many jelly beans are in the jar. 

First, we need to find the volume of the jar. The jar is a square base, so we multiply the length and width to get the area of the base. The area of the base is 6 x 6 = 36 square inches. 

Now, we multiply the area of the base by the height to get the volume of the jar. The volume of the jar is 36 x 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans are 0.15 cubic inches, we divide the volume of the jar by the volume of a jelly bean to get the total number of jelly beans. 540 / 0.15 = 3600 jelly beans.

Since 80% of the jelly beans are packed efficiently, we multiply 3600 by 0.8 to get the actual number of jelly beans in the jar. 3600 x 0.8 = 2880 jelly beans.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we multiply 2880 by 0.3 to get the number of red jelly beans. 2880 x 0.3 = 864 red jelly beans.

The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900. To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we subtract 864 from 900. 900 - 864 = 36.

The final answer is: 36"
"Let's break it down step by step.

1. The bus started with 20 people.
2. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus now is 20 + 40 = 60.
3. At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop entered the bus. 3/4 of 40 is 30. So, 30 people entered the bus at the second stop. Now, the total number of people on the bus is 60 + 30 = 90.
4. At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus now is 90 * 2 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the remaining spaces, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year. In 5 years, she visits 3 * 5 = 15 times. 

The cost of one visit is $2. After 5 years, the cost of one visit increased by 150%. 150% of $2 is 2 + (2 * 1.5) = 5. So, the new cost of one visit is 2 + 5 = $7.

Pauline visited 15 times in 5 years at $2 per visit, so she spent 15 * 2 = $30. 

In the next 3 years, the cost of one visit is $7. She visits 3 times a year, so she visits 3 * 3 = 9 times in 3 years. The cost of these visits is 9 * 7 = $63.

In total, Pauline spent $30 + $63 = $93.

The final answer is: $93"
"To find out how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to know how many students are there in total and how many can go at a time. 

There are 4 grades and each grade has 10 students. So, the total number of students is 4 x 10 = 40.

Only 8 students can go at a time. 

To find out how many groups we need, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group. 

40 ÷ 8 = 5

So, we need 5 groups. 

Each group takes 45 minutes. So, we multiply the number of groups by the time each group takes. 

5 x 45 = 225

The answer is: 225"
"John made 4 tables for $20 each. That's 4 x 20 = 80 dollars. 

He also made 2 roof frames for $10 each. That's 2 x 10 = 20 dollars.

"Let's say the shorter piece is x. The longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it's divided into two pieces. So, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is 40 feet.

We can write an equation to represent this: x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms: 5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5: x = 8

So, the shorter piece is 8 feet long. The longer piece is 4x, which is 4 * 8 = 32 feet.

The longer piece is 32 feet long.

"Aiden wants to make 80 meatballs. He gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat. To find out how many pounds of meat he needs, we divide 80 by 16.

80 ÷ 16 = 5

So, Aiden needs 5 pounds of meat. He uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for each pound of meat. To find out how much seasoning he needs, we multiply 5 by 2.

5 x 2 = 10

Aiden needs 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning."
"Luke has 5 windows. Each window is 35 inches wide. To find the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the number of windows by the width of each window.

5 windows * 35 inches/window = 175 inches

Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows. So, we need to multiply the total width by 2.

175 inches * 2 = 350 inches

So, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To find the cost of the call, we need to break it down into two parts. 

First, we need to find out how many minutes of the call cost $0.25 per minute and how many minutes cost $0.2 per minute. 

The call is 36 minutes long, and the price drops after 16 minutes. So, for the first 16 minutes, it costs $0.25 per minute. 

16 minutes * $0.25 per minute = $4

Now, we need to find out how much the rest of the call costs. The call is 36 minutes long, and 16 minutes have already passed, so 36 - 16 = 20 minutes are left.

20 minutes * $0.2 per minute = $4

Now, we add the cost of the first 16 minutes and the cost of the last 20 minutes. 

$4 + $4 = $8

"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Let's say the number of cupcakes she makes is x. Then, the number of brownies she makes is 3x - 2.

We also know that each person gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. So, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies. We can write an equation: x + (3x - 2) = 10.

Now, let's solve the equation. First, we combine like terms: x + 3x - 2 = 10. This simplifies to 4x - 2 = 10.

Next, we add 2 to both sides of the equation: 4x = 10 + 2. This simplifies to 4x = 12.

Now, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 12 / 4. This simplifies to x = 3.

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"First, we need to find out how much the manicure and pedicure cost together. The manicure is $35 and the pedicure is $40. So, $35 + $40 is $75.

Now, we need to find 20% of $75. 20% is the same as 0.2. So, we multiply $75 by 0.2. $75 x 0.2 is $15. 

Now, we need to subtract $15 from $75. $75 - $15 is $60.

Now, we need to find out how much the nail art costs. There are 10 fingers, and each costs $3. So, 10 x $3 is $30.

Now, we need to add $60 and $30. $60 + $30 is $90.

The final answer is: $90"

She also has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year. That's 1 x 6 = 6 issues.

The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so it sends 4 x 6 = 24 issues.

Now, let's add all the issues together: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

So, Susan gets 66 magazines every year.

"To find the price of the toy after it was discounted in January, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, we need to find the price of the toy in December after it increased by 80%. 
   To do this, we multiply the original price by 1.8 (which is 100% + 80%). 
   So, the price in December is 40 * 1.8 = 72.

2. Then, we need to find the price of the toy in January after it decreased by 50%. 
   To do this, we multiply the price in December by 0.5 (which is 100% - 50%). 
   So, the price in January is 72 * 0.5 = 36.

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is 36."
"Let's break it down. Charlie has 4 lessons at his standard rate of $80 per hour. So, that's 4 x $80 = $320.

For the lessons with the veteran, he reduces his rate by 25%. 25% of $80 is $20. So, his reduced rate is $80 - $20 = $60.

He has 2 lessons with the veteran, so that's 2 x $60 = $120.

Now, let's add the money he made from the standard lessons and the veteran lessons. $320 + $120 = $440.

The final answer is: $440"
"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and then divide by the number of scores.

First, let's add up all the scores:

130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

Now, we have the total score, which is 630. There are 9 scores in total. 

To find the mean, we divide the total score by the number of scores: 
630 ÷ 9 = 70

To find 1/4 of 20, we need to divide 20 by 4. 

20 divided by 4 is 5. 

So, Eve has 5 pomelos left. 

If Eve had 20 and has 5 now, she gave away 20 - 5 = 15 pomelos.

The answer is 15."
"Walter had 60 apples. He ate 2/5 of them. 2/5 of 60 is 24. So, he ate 24 apples. 

Now, he has 60 - 24 = 36 apples left. 

He gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples. 25% of 36 is 9. So, he gave 9 apples to his sister. 

Now, he has 36 - 9 = 27 apples left. 

He sold the remaining apples to his uncle at $3 each. So, he sold 27 apples at $3 each. 

27 x 3 = 81

Now, we need to find out what percentage of 6000 km is 3600 km. 

To do this, we divide 3600 by 6000 and then multiply by 100. 

3600 / 6000 = 0.6
0.6 x 100 = 60%

So, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Madeline ate 6 grapes. 
Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 6 x 5 = 30 grapes. 
Now, we have 6 (Madeline's grapes) + 30 (brother's grapes) = 36 grapes used so far. 
Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Each pie needs 12 grapes, so she used 4 x 12 = 48 grapes. 
Now, we have 36 (used grapes) + 48 (mother's grapes) = 84 grapes used in total. 
To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we need to add the grapes that were used to the grapes that were left. But we don't know how many grapes were left. 

Let's say the total number of grapes at the beginning is x. 
x - 84 = grapes left. 
Since the mother used all the remaining grapes, the number of grapes left is 48. 
So, x - 84 = 48. 
x = 48 + 84 = 132.

The final answer is: 132"

Now, we divide the total minutes in a day by the minutes it takes to clean one classroom. 

480 minutes/day / 15 minutes/classroom = 32 classrooms/day

Now, we know the custodian has 5 days to clean 80 classrooms. 

80 classrooms / 5 days = 16 classrooms/day

Now, we know how many classrooms they clean in a day and how many classrooms they can clean in a day. 

16 classrooms/day / 32 classrooms/day = 0.5 or 50% of their day is spent cleaning classrooms.

The middle shelves can hold 10 books each. There are 2 middle shelves, so they can hold 2 x 10 = 20 books. 

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 x 10 = 20 books. 

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books. 

So, the total number of books that one bookcase can hold is 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books. 

Now, we need to find out how many bookcases Elly needs to hold 110 books. We can do this by dividing 110 by 55. 

110 ÷ 55 = 2 

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all her books."

"To find out how much Alicia spends on dry-cleaning, we need to calculate the cost for each week and then multiply it by 5.

For 1 week:
- 5 blouses cost 5 x $5.00 = $25.00
- 1 skirt costs $6.00
- 2 pants cost 2 x $8.00 = $16.00
- Total cost for 1 week is $25.00 + $6.00 + $16.00 = $47.00

Now, we multiply the weekly cost by 5:
$47.00 x 5 = $235.00

The final answer is: $235.00"
"John's normal speed is 150 WPM.  After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster.  So, his new speed is 150 * 2.5 = 375 WPM.

To find out how long it takes him to speak 10 pages, we need to find out how many words he speaks in total.  Each page has 450 words.  So, 10 pages have 10 * 450 = 4500 words.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes him to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM.  We can do this by dividing the total number of words by his speed.  4500 / 375 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

On the first day, there were 50 people at the beach. 

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so there were 50 + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day, so there were 2 x 70 = 140 people.

Now, we have the number of people for the first three days: 50 + 70 + 140 = 260 people.

The rest of the week has 4 days. We know the average number of people each day for the rest of the week is 60. To find the total number of people for the rest of the week, we multiply the average by the number of days: 60 x 4 = 240 people.

Now, we add the number of people for the first three days to the number of people for the rest of the week: 260 + 240 = 500.

The final answer is: 500"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped. 

In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount popped, so 3 x 20 = 60 kernels popped. 

In the next 30 seconds, four times the initial popping rate popped, so 4 x 20 = 80 kernels popped. 

In the final 30 seconds, the popping slowed down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds, so half of 80 is 40 kernels popped. 

So, in total, 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels popped. 

But then, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat. A quarter of 40 is 10 kernels. 

So, we add those 10 kernels to the total, 200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

"Tim needs to make 5 gallons of lemonade. 4 gallons are regular and 1 gallon is extra and twice as tart. 

For the 4 regular gallons, he needs 4 cups of lemon juice. Since 6 lemons give 1 cup of juice, he needs 4 x 6 = 24 lemons for the regular gallons.

For the extra gallon, he needs 2 cups of lemon juice because it's twice as tart. So, he needs 2 x 6 = 12 lemons for the extra gallon.

In total, Tim needs 24 + 12 = 36 lemons.

"Let's count the dogs. We have 3 German Shepherds and 2 Bulldogs. That's 3 + 2 = 5 dogs.

Each German Shepherd eats 5 kilograms of food per day. So, 3 German Shepherds will eat 3 x 5 = 15 kilograms of food per day.

Each Bulldog eats 3 kilograms of food per day. So, 2 Bulldogs will eat 2 x 3 = 6 kilograms of food per day.

Now, let's add the food that the German Shepherds and Bulldogs eat per day. 15 + 6 = 21 kilograms of food per day.

We want to know how much food they will eat in a week. There are 7 days in a week. So, we multiply 21 kilograms by 7. 21 x 7 = 147.

"To find out how much the boat is worth after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

First year depreciation: 30% of $9000 is 0.3 x 9000 = $2700. So, the boat is worth 9000 - 2700 = $6300.

Second year depreciation: 30% of $6300 is 0.3 x 6300 = $1890. So, the boat is worth 6300 - 1890 = $4410.

Third year depreciation: 20% of $4410 is 0.2 x 4410 = $882. So, the boat is worth 4410 - 882 = $3528.

The boat is worth $3528 after three years."

We know there are 232 candies in total. We already know the number of red, orange, and yellow candies. To find the number of pink candies, we need to subtract the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies: 232 - 54 - 108 - 27 = 43.

The number of pink candies is 43."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much one bus trip costs. We know that one night at the hotel costs $80 and every bus trip is 10% of that cost. 

10% of $80 is 0.1 x 80 = $8. 

So, one bus trip costs $8. 

Helen rode the bus 7 times, so the total cost of the bus trips is 7 x $8 = $56. 

Now, we need to find out the total cost of the hotel. Helen booked the hotel for 3 nights, and one night costs $80. 

So, the total cost of the hotel is 3 x $80 = $240. 

Now, we add the cost of the hotel and the bus trips to find the total cost of the trip. 

Total cost = $240 (hotel) + $56 (bus trips) = $296.

The final answer is: $296"
"Mazie gave marbles to twins, so we know they got an equal number of marbles. 

Let's say Darla got x marbles. Since they are twins, Dallas also got x marbles.

We know Dallas has 21 marbles after dropping 4, so he had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles before dropping any. 

Since he got x marbles from Mazie, we can say x + x = 25 (because he had x marbles from Mazie and some other marbles that we don't know about, but we know he had 25 in total).

So, 2x = 25.

To find x, we divide both sides by 2: x = 25 / 2 = 12.5.

But we can't give half a marble, so we know that Mazie gave an equal number of marbles to both twins, and that number is 12.

Now we know that Dallas and Darla each got 12 marbles from Mazie. 

Mazie had 52 marbles and gave 12 to each of the twins, so she gave 12 + 12 = 24 marbles in total.

Adult tickets cost $12 each, so 2 adults will be 2 x 12 = 24 dollars. 

Child ticket costs $8. 

So, the total cost of tickets is 24 + 8 = 32 dollars. 

Then, they buy 2 popcorns for $3 each. 

2 x 3 = 6 dollars for the popcorns. 

Now, we add the cost of tickets and popcorns together.

Weight of the car = 1200 pounds
Weight of the luggage = 250 pounds
Weight of the two children = 75 pounds * 2 = 150 pounds

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

The force needed to move the car is 1% of the total weight. To find 1% of the total weight, we multiply the total weight by 0.01.

Force needed = 1600 * 0.01 = 16 pounds

"James is making 4 tables. Each table has 4 legs and each leg needs 2 screws. So, each table needs 4 x 2 = 8 screws. 

To find out how many screws James needs in total, we multiply the number of tables by the number of screws each table needs: 4 x 8 = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws. If he uses 32 screws, he will have 40 - 32 = 8 screws left over.

"There are 10 eggs in the first basket. The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, so it has 10 x 2 = 20 eggs. 

To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we add the eggs in the first basket to the eggs in the second basket. 10 + 20 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's figure this out. 

Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra. Alexandra raises $430. So, Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.

Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah. Sarah raises $300. So, Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we have the money each girl raised: Alexandra - $430, Kim - $750, Maryam - $700, and Sarah - $300.

To find the total, we add the money each girl raised: $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180.

The final answer is: $2180"
"Let's break it down. 

Vanessa ran 4 miles. Aaron ran half the distance of Vanessa, so Aaron ran 4 / 2 = 2 miles. 

Since Aaron was twice as fast as Vanessa, it means Aaron took half the time Vanessa took to run the same distance. If Aaron took 16 minutes to run 2 miles, then Vanessa took 2 x 16 = 32 minutes to run 4 miles.

The final answer is: 32"
"The caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. If there is 200 feet of dock, he needs 3 x 200 = 600 feet of line. He already has 6 feet of line. So, he needs 600 - 6 = 594 feet of line.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night. That means they get 6 reservations each day. 

They are open 2 days a week. So, they get 6 reservations * 2 days = 12 reservations in a week.

Each reservation has 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine. So, each reservation makes 2 * $5 + $5 = $15.

Now, we multiply the number of reservations in a week by the money they make from each reservation. 12 reservations * $15 = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"Let's break it down. 

The fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. 

To find out how much one watermelon costs, we need to divide the total cost by the number of watermelons. 

$80 ÷ 50 = $1.60 

Now, the vendor sold each watermelon at a profit of 25%. This means he sold each watermelon for 125% of its cost (100% of the cost + 25% profit).

So, we need to multiply the cost of one watermelon by 1.25 (which is 125% in decimal form).

$1.60 × 1.25 = $2.00

The answer is: $2.00"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

James is twice as old as Dora, and Dora will be 12 in 3 years. So, Dora's current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years. 

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James is 9 x 2 = 18 years old now.

James is 18 now, and he is John's son who John was 19 when he had him. So, John is 19 + 18 = 37 years old now.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32. So, John's youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old now.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"

"Mark needs a new radiator. It costs $400, but he gets it for 80% off. 80% off means he pays 20% of the price. 20% of $400 is 0.2 x 400 = $80. So Mark pays $80 for the radiator.

Then, the mechanic takes 3 hours to install it and charges $50 an hour. 3 x 50 = $150. So Mark pays $150 for the mechanic.

Mark paid $80 for the radiator and $150 for the mechanic. $80 + $150 = $230.

The final answer is: $230"
"Let's think about it. We know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. If we let the number of chickens be C and the number of cows be D, we can make an equation. 

C + D = 20 (because there are 20 animals in total)
2C + 4D = 70 (because chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, and they have a total of 70 legs)

We can solve the first equation for C: C = 20 - D

Now we can plug this into the second equation: 2(20 - D) + 4D = 70
40 - 2D + 4D = 70
2D = 30
D = 15

Now that we know D, we can find C: C = 20 - D
C = 20 - 15
C = 5

So, there are 5 chickens.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, we need to find the total number of slices. There are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. 

7 pizzas * 8 slices per pizza = 56 slices

Now, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. There are 4 people in total, including Henry and his 3 friends.

56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person

So, each person can have 14 slices."
