"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first determine how many eggs she has left after eating and baking. 

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and bakes 4 for muffins, so she uses a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. 

Now, let's subtract the number of eggs she uses from the total number of eggs she lays: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

Janet sells these 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. To find out how much she makes, we multiply the number of eggs she sells by the price per egg: 9 * 2 = 18.

So, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

"To find the total number of bolts needed for the robe, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, we can calculate the white fiber as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts (blue) / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we add the blue fiber and white fiber to get the total number of bolts:

Total bolts = 2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit Josh made, we first need to determine the total value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

To find the new value of the house, we can set up an equation: 

New Value = Original Value + (Original Value * 150% of the original value)

New Value = $80,000 + ($80,000 * 1.5)

New Value = $80,000 + $120,000

New Value = $200,000

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost (purchase price + repairs) from the new value of the house.

Total Cost = $80,000 (purchase price) + $50,000 (repairs) = $130,000

Profit = New Value - Total Cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

The final answer is: $70,000"
"To find the total number of meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he has in a week.

Since James runs 3 sprints in one session, and each sprint is 60 meters, the total meters he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James runs 3 sessions a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to determine the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals. 

In the morning, Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives her chickens 25 cups of feed. 

The total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per day, and she has a flock of 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed per day is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals from the total amount of feed needed per day. 

60 - 40 = 20 cups.

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 
The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * $3 = $1.8. 
We can see that the cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of the previous glass. 

The sequence of the cost of the glasses is: $5, $3, $1.8, $1.08, $0.64, $0.384, $0.2304, $0.13824, $0.082944, $0.0497664, $0.02986584, $0.017929504, $0.010757904, $0.006454144, $0.0038272864, $0.002306377184, $0.0013738263104.

To find the total cost, we need to sum up the cost of all the glasses. 
Total cost = $5 + $3 + $1.8 + $1.08 + $0.64 + $0.384 + $0.2304 + $0.13824 + $0.082944 + $0.0497664 + $0.02986584 + $0.017929504 + $0.010757904 + $0.006454144 + $0.0038272864 + $0.002306377184 + $0.0013738263104.

Total cost ≈ $24.999999999999996.

However, we can simplify this process by using a formula. The cost of the first glass is $5, and the cost of the second glass is 60% of $5. The cost of the third glass is 60% of the second glass, which is 60% of 60% of $5. This can be represented as 0.6 * 0.6 * $5 = 0.36 * $5. 

The cost of the nth glass can be represented as 0.6^(n-1) * $5. 

The total cost can be represented as the sum of the cost of the first glass and the sum of the cost of the remaining glasses. 
Total cost = $5 + Σ(0.6^(n-1) * $5) from n=2 to 16.

This is a geometric series with a first term of 0.6 * $5 and a common ratio of 0.6. The sum of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula: S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = 0.6 * $5 = $3, r = 0.6, and n = 15. 

Total cost = $5 + $3 * (1 - 0.6^15) / (1 - 0.6)

Total cost ≈ $24.999999999999996.

However, we can simplify this process by using a calculator or a programming language to calculate the sum of the geometric series.

Total cost ≈ $24.999999999999996.

However, we can simplify this process by using a calculator or a programming language to calculate the sum of the geometric series.

Total cost ≈ $25.

The final answer is: $25"
"To find the number of sheep in Toulouse, we first need to find the number of sheep in Charleston. Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, we can multiply 20 by 4 to find the number of sheep in Charleston.

Charleston sheep = 20 * 4 = 80

Now, we know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, we can multiply the number of sheep in Charleston by 2 to find the number of sheep in Toulouse.

Toulouse sheep = 80 * 2 = 160

Now, we have the number of sheep in Toulouse (160), Charleston (80), and Seattle (20). To find the total number of sheep, we add these numbers together.

Total sheep = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260

The final answer is: 260"
"To find the total time it takes Carla to download the file, we need to calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file.

First, let's find the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 x 200 = 80 GB. Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Next, we need to add the time it takes to install the updates, which is 20 minutes.

Finally, we need to find the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file. 60% of 200 GB is 0.6 x 200 = 120 GB. The time it takes to download 120 GB is 120 / 2 = 60 minutes.

The total time it takes to download the file is the sum of the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file: 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the distance traveled in each segment.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. The distance traveled in this segment is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles

Then, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is traveled in this segment.

Next, he drives for 0.5 hours (half an hour) at 30 mph. The distance traveled in this segment is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 mph * 0.5 hours = 15 miles

Finally, he drives for the remaining 1.5 hours (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours) at 80 mph. The distance traveled in this segment is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 mph * 1.5 hours = 120 miles

The total distance traveled is the sum of the distances in each segment:
Total Distance = 180 miles + 0 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 315 miles

However, since John is trying to get home, we need to subtract the distance he traveled from the initial distance. Unfortunately, the initial distance is not given, so we can't calculate the exact distance from home. But we can calculate the distance he traveled from the point where he turned around.

The distance from the point where he turned around is the distance traveled in the first segment (180 miles) plus the distance traveled in the second segment (15 miles), which is 195 miles.

The final answer is: 195"
"To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately, then add them together.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so her overtime rate is $10 * 1.2 = $12/hour. 
Her overtime earnings are:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and then add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it's 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. Then, we subtract 54 from 180 to get 126 downloads in the third month.

Now, we add the downloads from each month together: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts: 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen will be 3 x $68 = $204.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes: 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen will be 2 x $80 = $160.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen will be 6 x $55 = $330.

Finally, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of planting the tree and the annual expenses, and then find the point at which the total earnings from selling lemons exceed these costs.

The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. The annual expenses are $3 for watering and feeding. 

The tree grows 7 lemons per year, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. So, the total annual earnings from selling lemons are 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.

The net annual profit is the total earnings minus the annual expenses: $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

To find the number of years it takes for the tree to start earning money, we need to calculate how many years it takes for the total earnings to exceed the initial cost of planting the tree.

Let's denote the number of years as 'n'. The total earnings after 'n' years will be $10.5 * n. The total cost will be the initial cost plus the annual expenses multiplied by 'n': $90 + $3n.

We want to find the smallest 'n' for which the total earnings exceed the total cost: $10.5n > $90 + $3n.

Subtracting $3n from both sides gives us $7.5n > $90. 

Dividing both sides by $7.5 gives us n > $90 / $7.5.

Calculating $90 / $7.5 gives us 12.

Since 'n' must be an integer (you can't have a fraction of a year), the smallest 'n' for which the inequality holds is 13.

Therefore, it will take 13 years for the tree to start earning money.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

At the green house, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners, which is x/3.

At the red house, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners.

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which is (x - x/3 - 2)/2.

We know that after selling at all the houses, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

To simplify the equation, let's first simplify the fraction (x - x/3 - 2)/2:

(x - x/3 - 2)/2 = (2x/3 - 6)/2 = x/3 - 3

Now, let's rewrite the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x/3 - 3) = 5

Combine like terms:

x - 2x/3 - 2 + x/3 - 3 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - 2x/3 + x/3 - 5 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - x/3 - 5 = 5

Combine like terms:

2x/3 - 5 = 5

Add 5 to both sides:

2x/3 = 10

Multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 15

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, and then subtract that from the total number of students.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20 * 0.2 = 4 students

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
16 * 0.25 = 4 students

The number of students who enrolled in jazz dance is 4, and the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance is also 4. So, the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students.

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the maximum profit, we need to calculate the potential future value of both options. 

The jewelry market is expected to rise by 2.5%, so the future value of the jewelry will be $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,125.

The electronic gadgets market is expected to rise by 1.2%, so the future value of the electronic gadgets will be $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,096.

Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, we need to choose the option with the higher future value. In this case, the electronic gadgets option has a higher future value of $8,096.

To calculate the profit, we subtract the initial cost from the future value: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96.

The final answer is: $96"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered on the first day and the distance covered on the second day.

On the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance. 

On the second day, they travel 150 miles northward. Again, since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance.

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles.

"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:

She works 35 hours a week as a teacher and gets paid $20 per hour. Since she works 50 weeks a year, her total hours worked as a teacher in a year is:
35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year

Her earnings from teaching in a year is:
1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:

She works 15 hours a week as a coach and gets paid $30 per hour. Since she works 50 weeks a year, her total hours worked as a coach in a year is:
15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year

Her earnings from coaching in a year is:
750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
$35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

"To find out how many eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week and then multiply it by 4.

Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, so in a week, she eats 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week.

In 4 weeks, she will eat 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she will eat in 4 weeks.

84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much time Marissa has left to walk the remaining distance. 

She has walked 4 miles in 1 hour and 2 miles in another hour, so she has walked a total of 6 miles in 2 hours. 

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles, and she has already walked 6 miles, so she has 12 - 6 = 6 miles left to walk.

Since she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, and the total distance is 12 miles, she needs to cover the total distance in 12 / 4 = 3 hours.

She has already walked for 2 hours, so she has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left to walk the remaining 6 miles.

To find her required speed, we divide the remaining distance by the remaining time: 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.

"To find the total amount of water in the orange drink, we first need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, this means 6.67 liters of the orange drink is water.

Next, we need to find the total amount of water in the pineapple drink. Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, this means 9 liters of the pineapple drink is water.

Now, we need to subtract the 1 liter of orange drink that was spilled. The total amount of water in the orange drink after the spill is 6.67 - 1 = 5.67 liters.

The total amount of water in the mixture is the sum of the water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink, which is 5.67 + 9 = 14.67 liters.

However, we are asked to find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture. Since we have a total of 10 + 15 = 25 liters initially, and 1 liter was spilled, we have 25 - 1 = 24 liters remaining. The amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 14.67 liters."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how old Raymond was when his son was born and then subtract that from the current age of his son.

First, let's find out how old Raymond is now. Since Samantha is 31 and Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old.

Raymond had a son at the age of 23, so when his son was born, Raymond was 23 years old. 

Now, we need to find out how many years have passed since Raymond's son was born. Since Raymond is 25 now and he was 23 when his son was born, 25 - 23 = 2 years have passed.

However, we need to find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, not how many years have passed since he was born. Since we know that 2 years have passed since his son was born, we need to subtract 2 from the current age of the son to find out how old he was when he was born. However, we are not given the current age of the son. 

However, we can find the current age of the son by adding the age at which he was born to the number of years that have passed since he was born. Since we know that 2 years have passed since he was born, and he was born at the age of 23, his current age is 23 + 2 = 25.

Now that we know the current age of the son, we can find out how many years ago he was born by subtracting the age at which he was born from his current age. 25 - 23 = 2.

The first 3 customers buy one DVD each, so they buy a total of 3 DVDs.
The next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each, so they buy a total of 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs.

Now, let's add the total number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers: 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

The last 3 customers don't buy any DVDs, so we don't need to add anything to the total.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to determine the amount of the discount and add it to the discounted price. 

First, let's find the amount of the discount: 
Discount = 25% of the original price
Let's denote the original price as 'x'. 
Then, the discount is 0.25x.

The discounted price is the original price minus the discount: 
Discounted price = x - 0.25x = 0.75x

We know the discounted price is $19.50. 
So, we can set up the equation: 
0.75x = 19.50

To find 'x', we need to divide both sides by 0.75: 
x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6. 

The total cost of the items excluding pizza is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33. 

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17. 

Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so the number of boxes of pizza is $17 / $8.50 = 2.

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she buys and multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will go through 60 servings in 60 days. 

Each carton has 15 servings, so we need to divide 60 servings by 15 servings per carton to find out how many cartons she buys: 
60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Now, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton to find the total cost:
4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

So, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

"To find the distance traveled between Henry's first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

First, we know that Henry's second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total distance of the trip is 60 miles, we can find the distance from the start to the second stop by subtracting 15 miles from the total distance: 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

However, this is the distance from the start to the second stop. To find the distance between the first and second stops, we need to subtract the distance traveled before the first stop, which is 20 miles. 

So, the distance between the first and second stops is 45 - 20 = 25 miles.

"Let's break down the information given. We know that one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, which means the second pair costs 2 * $33 = $66. 

The total cost of the two pairs of heels is $33 + $66 = $99. We are also told that the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. 

Let's represent the cost of the boots as 'x'. Since the two pairs of heels cost five dollars less than the boots, we can write the equation: x - 5 = 99.

To find the cost of the boots, we need to solve for 'x'. We can do this by adding 5 to both sides of the equation: x = 99 + 5.

x = 104

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let Darrell's age be 7x and Allen's age be 11x, where x is a constant. 

Since their total age is 162, we can write the equation: 
7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 
18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: 
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age: 
Allen's age = 11x = 11 * 9 = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.
The second person guesses 20 more than half of the first one, which is (80 / 2) + 20 = 60.
The third person guesses 25% more than the first one, which is 80 + (80 * 0.25) = 100.

Now, let's add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

There are 3 people, so we divide the total by 3 to find the average: 240 / 3 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total hours John spends taking care of dogs in a week, we need to first calculate the total hours he spends per day. 

Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day, and John has 10 dogs. So, the total hours per day is 0.5 * 10 = 5 hours.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the total hours per day by 7 to get the total hours per week. 

5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

The final answer is: 35"
"To find the number of gold coins, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'.

We know that the total number of coins is 110, which is the sum of silver and gold coins. So, we can write the equation as:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:
2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since x represents the number of silver coins, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we first need to determine how many jewels Aaron has. 

Since Raymond has 40 jewels, half of Raymond's jewels would be 40 / 2 = 20. 

Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes separately, then add them together.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which is 1. Then, we add this to the original 4 points to get the total points scored in the second 20 minutes: 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The total points Mike scored is 9."
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to first determine how many yogurts he eats in 30 days and then calculate the cost.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. In 30 days, he will eat 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The sale is 4 yogurts for $5.00. To find the cost of 1 yogurt, we divide $5.00 by 4: $5.00 / 4 = $1.25 per yogurt.

Now, we multiply the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days by the cost of 1 yogurt: 60 * $1.25 = $75.00.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To find out how many LEGO sets John still has, we need to first calculate how much money he made from selling the LEGO sets and then subtract the cost of the video games and the remaining money.

John sells 13 LEGO sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is:
13 LEGO sets * $15 per set = $195

He then buys 8 video games for $20 each, so the total cost of the video games is:
8 video games * $20 per game = $160

After buying the video games, he has $5 left. This means he spent $195 - $160 = $35 on the video games and had $5 left.

Now, we need to find out how much money he had before buying the video games. This is the sum of the money he made from selling the LEGO sets and the money he had left:
$35 (spent on video games) + $5 (left) = $40

Since he made $195 from selling the LEGO sets, and he had $40 before buying the video games, we can set up an equation to find out how much money he had before selling the LEGO sets:
$195 (made from LEGO sets) + x (initial money) = $40 (before buying video games)

Solving for x, we get:
x = $40 - $195
x = -$155

However, this doesn't make sense, as you can't have negative money. This means that John must have had some money initially to buy the LEGO sets. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Let's say John had y dollars initially. He then sold the LEGO sets and had $195 + y dollars. After buying the video games, he had $5 left. The equation becomes:
$195 + y - $160 = $5
Simplifying the equation:
$35 + y = $5
y = $5 - $35
y = -$30

Again, this doesn't make sense, as you can't have negative money. This means that our initial assumption is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the problem again.

"To find John's running speed, we first need to calculate the total hours he runs per week. 

He runs 3 hours on the first day. The other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours per day. 

So, the total hours he runs per week is 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours.

Since John runs 60 miles a week and runs for 6 hours a week, we can find his speed by dividing the total miles by the total hours: 

Speed = Total miles / Total hours = 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's walking speed. Since she can skip at half the speed of running and skip at 3 miles per hour, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour. 

Since she can run four times faster than she can walk, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, we need to find the time she spends running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, the time she spends running is 6 hours * (1/3) = 2 hours, and the time she spends walking is 6 hours * (2/3) = 4 hours.

The distance she travels while running is her running speed * time spent running = 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles. The distance she travels while walking is her walking speed * time spent walking = 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours = 6 miles.

The total distance she can travel in six hours is the sum of the distances she travels while running and walking, which is 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

The final answer is: 18"

"To solve this problem, we need to find the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone and then subtract the dragon's reach from that distance.

When Polly holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. Since she can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, she can throw it 3 * 400 = 1200 feet with the gemstone.

The dragon's reach is 1000 feet, so Polly can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet outside of the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces. 

First, let's calculate the total number of pieces. Since Grandma Jones cut each pie into 8 pieces and she baked 5 pies, the total number of pieces is 5 * 8 = 40.

Now, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces to find out how many were taken by the guests. 

40 (total pieces) - 14 (remaining pieces) = 26

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to determine how many calories you have left to consume. 

Your daily calorie target is 2000, and you have already consumed 1800 calories. 

2000 (daily target) - 1800 (already consumed) = 200 calories left

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, we need to find out how many servings you can have within your remaining calorie limit.

200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, we need to find out how many grams are in one serving.

300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving

Now, we can multiply the number of servings you can have by the grams per serving to find out how many grams you can eat.

0.8 servings * 60g per serving = 48g

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips. 

The final answer is: 48"
"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

First, let's find the total cost. Since one pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00, and Charlie makes 10 candles per pound, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles. The total cost of the beeswax and wicks for 20 candles is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.

Next, let's find the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles, so the total revenue is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

Now, let's find the net profit. The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. So, the net profit is $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we first need to determine the number of articles she wrote each day.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. To find this, we multiply the number of articles she wrote on Monday by 2/5 and add it to the original number of articles. 
5 + (5 * 2/5) = 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. 
7 * 2 = 14 articles on Wednesday.

Now, we add up the number of articles she wrote each day to find the total number of articles. 
5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to write, we multiply the total number of articles by the time it takes to write one article. 
26 * 4 = 104 hours.

The final answer is: 104"
"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to first determine how many Post-it notes she used in total. 

Candice started with 80 Post-it notes. She used 220 Post-it notes at work. To find the total number of Post-it notes she used, we add these two numbers together: 80 + 220 = 300. 

Since she had 23 Post-it notes remaining, we need to subtract this from the total number of Post-it notes she used to find out how many she purchased. 

300 (used) - 23 (remaining) = 277

So, Candice purchased 277 Post-it notes.

The final answer is: 277"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many blue ties John bought. Since he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

Now, we need to find the cost of each red tie. Since the red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, the cost of each red tie is:

Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + (50% of the cost of each blue tie)
= $40 + (0.5 * $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Finally, we can calculate the total amount spent on all ties:

Total amount spent on all ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

"To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches, since the pieces are 6 inches long. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the total length of the wire in inches is 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.

Now, we can divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces Tracy obtained: 48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of units in the building, we need to multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor. 

Number of floors: 15
Units per floor: 8

Total units = Number of floors * Units per floor
Total units = 15 * 8
Total units = 120

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total units to determine the number of unoccupied units.

Unoccupied units = Total units * (1 - 3/4)
Unoccupied units = Total units * 1/4
Unoccupied units = 120 * 1/4
Unoccupied units = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs produced per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs are produced per week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily egg production by 7:

252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Since Lloyd sells eggs by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so:

1764 eggs/week / 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen eggs/week

Now, we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen to find out how much Lloyd makes per week:

147 dozen eggs/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

The final answer is: $294"
"To find the total time it takes for Tom to travel back, we first need to determine the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since we don't know the exact distance, let's assume it's 'd' miles. 

The time taken to travel from 1 to 4 PM is d / 10 hours. 

Now, the time taken to travel back is d / 6 hours. 

The total time taken is the sum of these two times: d / 10 + d / 6.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 30. 

So, the total time is (3d + 5d) / 30 = 8d / 30 = 4d / 15 hours.

However, we still need to find the value of 'd'. To do this, we need to know the distance traveled from 1 to 4 PM. 

Since we don't have the exact distance, let's assume it's traveled for a certain number of hours, say 't'. 

Then, d = 10t.

Now, we can substitute this value of 'd' in the equation for total time: 

Total time = 4d / 15 = 4(10t) / 15 = 40t / 15 = 8t / 3 hours.

However, we still need to find the value of 't'. 

Since Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM, the time taken is 3 hours. 

So, t = 3.

Now, we can substitute this value of 't' in the equation for total time: 

Total time = 8t / 3 = 8(3) / 3 = 24 / 3 = 8 hours.

However, this is the time taken from 1 to 4 PM. 

The time taken to travel back is the same as the time taken to travel from 1 to 4 PM, which is 3 hours.

So, the total time taken to travel back is 3 hours.

The final answer is: 3"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, and the comic books already account for 7.5 pounds, the remaining weight to be removed is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can find the number of toys to be removed by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total revenue for each day, we need to calculate the revenue from truck tires and car tires separately and then add them together.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires at $60 each and 4 car tires at $40 each. 
Revenue from truck tires on Thursday = 6 * $60 = $360
Revenue from car tires on Thursday = 4 * $40 = $160
Total revenue on Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires at $40 each and no truck tires.
Revenue from car tires on Friday = 12 * $40 = $480
Total revenue on Friday = $480

To find the day with higher revenue, we compare the total revenue on Thursday and Friday. 
Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue.

Now, to find how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we subtract the revenue of the day with lower revenue from the day with higher revenue.
Difference in revenue = $520 - $480 = $40

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of kittens, we first need to determine the number of kittens each cat had. 

Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens, and since there were 7 adopted kittens, Patchy had 3 * 7 = 21 kittens.

Trixie had 12 kittens.

The total number of kittens is the sum of the adopted kittens and the kittens from the two house cats. So, the total number of kittens is 7 (adopted) + 21 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we first need to determine the number of lollipops remaining after eating 2. 

Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2, so the number of lollipops remaining is 30 - 2 = 28.

Since Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to find out how many bags can be filled.

28 lollipops / 2 lollipops per bag = 14 bags

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate how many times he can afford the total cost of a movie outing, which includes both the ticket and the popcorn.

The total cost of a movie outing is $7 (ticket) + $7 (popcorn) = $14.

We know Peter has $42 for the week. To find out how many times he can go to the movies, we'll divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of a movie outing.

$42 ÷ $14 = 3

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week.

"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit, and then divide the result by the weight of each box.

First, let's calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge:

Bridge's weight limit: 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck: 3755 pounds
Remaining weight capacity: 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Next, let's divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of each box:

Weight of each box: 15 pounds
Maximum number of boxes: 1245 / 15 = 83

So, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83.

The final answer is: 83"
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to first calculate the total cost after the delivery vendor's fee. 

The original bill was $40.00. The vendor added a 25% fee to this amount. To find 25% of $40.00, we multiply $40.00 by 0.25. 

$40.00 * 0.25 = $10.00

Now, we add the 25% fee to the original bill: 
$40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00

Next, we add the $3.00 delivery fee to the total: 
$50.00 + $3.00 = $53.00

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip to the total: 
$53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00.

The final answer is: $57.00"
"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to calculate the number of raspberries in the clusters and add the individual raspberries.

There is 1 bad orange, 20% of 25 oranges are unripe, and 2 are sour. 

First, let's find the number of unripe oranges: 
20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges

Now, let's add the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges: 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges

Now, we subtract the total number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges: 
25 (total oranges) - 8 (not good oranges) = 17 oranges

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the value of the pension after 30 years and then add the additional 5% of the value for the last 10 years.

First, let's calculate the total pension value after 30 years. Since Marcy gets $50,000 per year for 10 years, we can calculate the total pension value as follows:

Total pension value = $50,000 * 10 = $500,000

Now, we need to calculate the additional pension for the last 10 years. Marcy becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year after 20 years. So, for the last 10 years, she will get 5% of the total pension value.

Additional pension = 5% of $500,000 = 0.05 * $500,000 = $25,000

Now, we add the additional pension to the initial pension for the first 10 years:

Annual pension = $50,000 + $25,000 = $75,000

The final answer is: $75,000"
"To find the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to calculate the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately and then add them together.

The streaming service charges $140 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the first half of the year consists of 6 months. 

The amount Aleena paid for the first half of the year is 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charged her 10% less money. To find the amount she paid for the second half of the year, we need to calculate 10% of $140 and subtract it from $140.

10% of $140 = 0.1 * $140 = $14

The amount Aleena paid for the second half of the year is $140 - $14 = $126.

Now, we add the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year to find the total amount she paid for the streaming service by the end of the year.

Total amount = $840 + $126 = $966

The final answer is: $966"
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to determine the car's miles per gallon (mpg) rating. We can do this by dividing the distance traveled since the last fill-up (100 miles) by the amount of gas used (4 gallons).

mpg = distance / gas used
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know the car's mpg rating, we can calculate the total distance Sophia can drive on a full tank by multiplying the tank capacity (12 gallons) by the mpg rating.

total distance = tank capacity * mpg
total distance = 12 gallons * 25 miles/gallon
total distance = 300 miles

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

"To find the total time spent on TV and reading, we first need to calculate the time spent on each activity per week. 

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV. 
He then reads for half as long, which is 2 / 2 = 1 hour.

So, the total time spent on TV and reading per day is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent per week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

To find the total time spent in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly time by 4: 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

"To find the total number of people sent by the schools, we need to calculate the number of students and coaches for both the girls' and boys' teams.

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players. So, the total number of students from each school is 2 teams * 5 players/team = 10 players.

Each school also has a coach for each team, so there are 2 coaches per school.

Now, we multiply the number of students and coaches per school by the total number of schools to find the total number of people sent by all schools.

Total students = 10 players/school * 4 schools = 40 players
Total coaches = 2 coaches/school * 4 schools = 8 coaches

Total people = Total students + Total coaches = 40 + 8 = 48

"To find the total number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total number of cups of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year and then divide it by the number of cups in a bag.

First, let's calculate the number of cups the puppy will eat in the first 180 days. Since the puppy eats 1 cup of dog food every day for 180 days, the total number of cups is:
1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups

Next, let's calculate the number of cups the puppy will eat for the rest of its life. Since the puppy eats 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of its life, we need to find out how many days are left in the first year. There are 365 days in a year, so the number of days left is:
365 days - 180 days = 185 days

The total number of cups the puppy will eat for the rest of its life is:
2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups

Now, let's add the number of cups the puppy will eat in the first 180 days and the number of cups it will eat for the rest of its life:
180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

"To find the better price, we need to calculate the cost per flower for each package option. 

For the package of 3 flowers for $2.50, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower.

For the package of 2 flowers for $1, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.5 per flower.

Since $0.5 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers for $1 is the better option.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. 18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages. The total cost is 9 packages * $1 per package = $9.

To find the cost of buying 18 flowers at the more expensive option, we calculate 18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages. The total cost is 6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15.

The amount of money saved is $15 - $9 = $6.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of games they lost is x. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is x + 8.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, which is the sum of the games won and lost. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we first need to calculate her salary after five years of service, and then calculate the increase for the next three years.

Initially, Sylvie's salary is $600. 

After one year, her salary will be 600 + (600 * 0.10) = 600 + 60 = $660.

After two years, her salary will be 660 + (660 * 0.10) = 660 + 66 = $726.

After three years, her salary will be 726 + (726 * 0.10) = 726 + 72.60 = $798.60.

After four years, her salary will be 798.60 + (798.60 * 0.10) = 798.60 + 79.86 = $878.46.

After five years, her salary will be 878.46 + (878.46 * 0.10) = 878.46 + 87.846 = $966.306.

Since Sylvie has already reached the five-year mark, she will receive a 10% increase for the next three years. 

After six years, her salary will be 966.306 + (966.306 * 0.10) = 966.306 + 96.6306 = $1062.9366.

After seven years, her salary will be 1062.9366 + (1062.9366 * 0.10) = 1062.9366 + 106.29366 = $1169.23026.

After eight years, her salary will be 1169.23026 + (1169.23026 * 0.10) = 1169.23026 + 116.923026 = $1286.153286.

So, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service will be $1286.15."
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as H. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, the number of copies Marilyn sold is 10H.

We know that the total number of copies sold is 88,000, which is the sum of the copies sold by Marilyn and Harald. So, we can write the equation:

H + 10H = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11H = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

H = 88,000 / 11
H = 8,000

The final answer is: 8000"
"To find out how many gift bags Christina needs, we first need to calculate the number of guests she expects to attend. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, we can find the number of expected attendees by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of invited guests.

16 (invited guests) - (1/4 * 16) = 16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply the number of expected attendees by 0.75.

12 (expected attendees) * 0.75 = 9

So, Christina needs 9 gift bags. Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag.

9 (gift bags) * $2 (cost per gift bag) = $18

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount an adult and a child will eat, then multiply by the number of adults and children, and finally add those two amounts together.

An adult will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much as an adult, which is 10 / 2 = 5 lbs.

There are 20 adults, so the total amount of potato salad needed for adults is 20 * 10 = 200 lbs.

There are 5 children, so the total amount of potato salad needed for children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amount for adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

The final answer is: 225"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

Cindy has 4 pets. 
Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.
Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of pets each person has: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

The final answer is: 28"
"Let's break down the information given:

- James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.
- Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.
- Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find Gerald's new time, we first need to find his original time. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can set up an equation: Lee's time = Gerald's time + 2. We know Lee's time is 38 seconds, so we can substitute that in: 38 = Gerald's time + 2.

To find Gerald's original time, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: Gerald's time = 38 - 2 = 36 seconds.

Now, we know Gerald's original time is 36 seconds. His speed improved by 10%, so we need to find 10% of 36 and add it to 36 to get his new time. 10% of 36 is 0.1 * 36 = 3.6. 

Gerald's new time = 36 + 3.6 = 39.6 seconds.

The final answer is: 39.6"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.
2. There are two cats for every dog.
3. The number of dogs is 60.

Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, the number of cats can be calculated as follows:
Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
= 2 * 60
= 120

Now, we know the number of dogs and cats. The combined number of dogs and cats is:
Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 60 + 120
= 180

According to the first point, the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats:
Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
= 180 - 12
= 168

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats:
Total number of pets = Number of rabbits + Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 168 + 60 + 120
= 348

The final answer is: 348"
"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls and then subtract the number of girls in the girl scout.

First, let's find the number of boys and girls. We know that 2/5 of the students are boys. 

Number of boys = (2/5) * 200 = 80

Since there are 200 students in total, the number of girls can be found by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students.

Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

Now, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = (2/3) * 120 = 80

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Number of girls not in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many hours James slept, we need to calculate 2/3 of the hours Harry slept. 

Harry slept 9 hours, so 2/3 of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6 hours. 

Since James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept, James slept 6 hours. 

To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we need to subtract the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept. 

9 (Harry's hours) - 6 (James' hours) = 3 hours.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we first need to determine the total volume of the tomatoes before they were cooked. Since the sauce made 32 ounces and it's half the volume of the tomatoes, the total volume of the tomatoes must be 32 * 2 = 64 ounces.

Since each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces, we can divide the total volume of the tomatoes by the volume of each can to find out how many cans Freda used: 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so we multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can to find the total number of tomatoes: 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to first determine the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam. 

We know that 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. Since 5 cars took an exit, we need to subtract those from the total number of cars that were originally on the motorway. 

So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25 cars.

Now, we know that 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. To find out how many cars drove through in the first 15 minutes, we need to subtract 20 from the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam.

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 25 - 20 = 5 cars.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we first need to determine how many potted plants she has initially and then subtract the number of plants she gives away.

Mary initially has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so she has 2 * 40 = 80 potted plants.

She also received 18 new potted plants from the nursery, so now she has 80 + 18 = 98 potted plants.

Tomorrow, she will give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges, so she will give away 40 potted plants.

To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we subtract the number of plants she gives away from the total number of plants she has: 98 - 40 = 58.

So, Mary will have 58 potted plants left.

The final answer is: 58"
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and add them up.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. 
1/4 of 20 is 5, so the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
We are given that the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, we add up the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell: 
20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 70 (third friend) + 60 (fourth friend) = 175

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."
"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read in total, we need to add up the pages from all his textbooks. 

4 pages (Science) + 20 pages (Social Studies) + 7 pages (History) + 8 pages (Geography) = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, we need to subtract those from the total to find out how many pages are left to read.

39 pages - 15 pages = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average per day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days.

24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately, and then add them together.

On weekdays, John drinks 4 glasses of water (one with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and one before bed). Since there are 5 weekdays, he drinks 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 1 glass of soda with dinner, but he still drinks 3 glasses of water with breakfast, lunch, and before bed. So, he drinks 3 glasses of water on each weekend day. Since there are 2 weekend days, he drinks 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water on weekends.

Now, let's add the number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays and weekends: 20 (weekdays) + 6 (weekends) = 26.

Poppy places a quarter of the 1000 pieces, which is 1000 * 0.25 = 250 pieces. 

Now, there are 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left. 

Her mom places a third of the remaining 750 pieces, which is 750 * (1/3) = 250 pieces. 

Now, we subtract the pieces her mom placed from the remaining pieces: 750 - 250 = 500 pieces.

So, there are 500 pieces left to be placed.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 2 episodes of a 1-hour show, which is 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's call the number of episodes 'x'. Since each episode is 30 minutes, the total time he watched on Wednesday is 30x minutes.

On Thursday, he watched 1 hour (60 minutes) and 1 30-minute show, which is a total of 90 minutes.

On Friday, he watched 2 episodes of a 1-hour show, which is 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

The total time Frankie watched TV is 7 hours, which is 7 * 60 = 420 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time he watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday: 2 + 2 + 90 + 120 = 214 minutes.

The time he watched on Wednesday is the difference between the total time and the time he watched on other days: 420 - 214 = 206 minutes.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes, we can find the number of episodes by dividing the total time by 30: 206 / 30 = 6.8666. Since we can't have a fraction of an episode, we round down to the nearest whole number, but in this case, we can have a fraction of an episode, so we will keep it as a decimal.

However, the question asks for the number of 30-minute episodes, and since we can't have a fraction of an episode, we can round down to the nearest whole number, but in this case, we will keep it as a decimal.

The number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday is 6.8666."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as 'x'. Since Henry wants to make twice as many as he did last year, he plans to bake 2x cookies this year.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has a total of 110 cookies. This can be represented as (2x + 15) - 5 = 110.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 10 = 110.

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get 2x = 100.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 50.

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To find the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of gas without the rewards, and then subtract the cashback rewards.

The cost of gas without rewards is the price per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons:
$3.00 per gallon * 10 gallons = $30.00

The cashback rewards are $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons, the rewards would be:
$0.20 per gallon * 10 gallons = $2.00

Now, we subtract the cashback rewards from the total cost of gas:
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The final cost of gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00."
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by each, we need to multiply the width by the length of each roll-up. 

Beatrice's roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 rolls long, so the total number of roll-ups she ate is 2 * 24 = 48.

Marcell's roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 rolls long, so the total number of roll-ups he ate is 3 * 14 = 42.

To find the average number of roll-ups eaten, we need to add the total number of roll-ups eaten by both and divide by 2. 

Total roll-ups eaten = 48 + 42 = 90
Average roll-ups eaten = 90 / 2 = 45

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to determine how many sets of 10 feet Julia rowed and then multiply that by the amount of water taken on per set.

First, let's find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia can row in 64 seconds. We know it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, so we can find the time it takes to row 10 feet by dividing 16 seconds by 2. 

16 seconds / 2 = 8 seconds per 10 feet

Now, we can find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia can row in 64 seconds by dividing 64 seconds by 8 seconds per 10 feet.

64 seconds / 8 seconds per 10 feet = 8 sets of 10 feet

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we can multiply the number of sets by the amount of water taken on per set.

8 sets * 2 liters per set = 16 liters

2. Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.
3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

From point 1, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, then Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

From point 2, we know that Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Since Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs, the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo is 300 / 50 = 6.

"To find the total cost of the lumber, we need to calculate the cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards and the 4 x 4 x 10 boards separately and then add them together.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $10 per board = $100.

The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $16 per board = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the lumber is 1.5 times the original price. 

The new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 per board.

The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 per board.

The total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $15 per board = $150.

The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $24 per board = $120.

The total revenue is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

"To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we need to determine the total parts in the ratio and then find the fraction of the total that represents the sugar. 

The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, so the total parts in the ratio is 7 + 13 = 20.

Since Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and water, we can set up a proportion to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar:

(7/20) = x/120

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we first need to determine the total number of vehicles that were already at the port. We know that there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles initially is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30. To find the number of vehicles brought in on the second day, we subtract the initial number of vehicles from the total number of vehicles: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers brought in on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles brought in by the number of vehicles per container: 20 / 5 = 4.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Lylah's salary four years ago. 

Let's assume Lylah's salary four years ago was 'x'. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can express Adrien's salary as 1.3x. We are given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, so we can set up the equation:

1.3x = 40000

To find 'x', we can divide both sides by 1.3:

x = 40000 / 1.3
x = 30769.23

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30769.23.

Now, we need to find Adrien's salary four years later. We are given that his salary increased by 40% of his original salary. We can express this as:

New salary = Original salary + (40% of Original salary)
= 40000 + (0.4 * 40000)
= 40000 + 16000
= 56000

Now, we need to find Lylah's salary four years later. Since their salaries increased simultaneously, we can assume the percentage increase in Lylah's salary is the same as Adrien's, which is 40%. We can express Lylah's new salary as:

New salary = Original salary + (40% of Original salary)
= 30769.23 + (0.4 * 30769.23)
= 30769.23 + 12307.69
= 43076.92

Now, we can find the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later by adding their new salaries:

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
= 56000 + 43076.92
= 99076.92

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, so Kael brought 2 * 5 = 10 apples. 
Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, so Kael brought 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

Now, we need to find the total number of fruits each person brought. 
Morisette brought 5 + 8 = 13 fruits. 
Kael brought 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of fruits each person brought.

"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate her sleep hours for each day and add them up.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than the previous two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours for each part of the week:

- Monday: 8 hours

"To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour.

First, let's calculate the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's calculate the remaining time after 3 hours:
Total time = 7 hours
Time already run = 3 hours
Remaining time = Total time - Time already run
Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours
Remaining time = 4 hours

Next, let's calculate the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distances from both parts to find the total distance:
Total distance = Distance at 10 mph + Distance at 5 mph
Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total distance = 50 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many letters Jennie stamped and then subtract that from the total number of letters that were already stamped when she started.

We know that Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. Since there are 60 letters needing stamps, one-third of that is 60 / 3 = 20 letters.

We also know that after Jennie stamped 20 letters, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This means that the 20 letters Jennie stamped were added to the pile of already-stamped letters.

So, to find out how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began, we need to subtract the 20 letters Jennie added from the current total of 30 letters.

30 (current total) - 20 (letters Jennie added) = 10

Therefore, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

Initial spoons (x) + spoons from her husband (5) - spoons used (3) = Total spoons (12)

x + 5 - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation:

x + 2 = 12

Subtract 2 from both sides:

x = 10

So, Julia bought a package of 10 spoons.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages. 

First, let's find the number of fish sausages. Since Dylan bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, we can add 6 to the number of chicken sausages: 38 + 6 = 44.

Now, we can add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages to find the total: 38 + 44 = 82.

The final answer is: 82"
"To find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we first need to determine the number of friends Amy has. Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily has 50 friends, we can calculate Amy's friends by adding 20 to Lily's total.

Amy's friends = Lily's friends + 20
Amy's friends = 50 + 20
Amy's friends = 70

Now, to find the total number of friends they have together, we add the number of friends Lily and Amy have.

Total friends = Lily's friends + Amy's friends
Total friends = 50 + 70
Total friends = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to determine the cost of each item and then multiply it by the quantity.

First, let's find the cost of a watermelon. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs $15, the cost of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45.

Next, we find the cost of an orange. An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so the cost of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each item:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is the sum of the costs of all items: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

The final answer is: $880"
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total time spent by doctors and the total amount charged to patients, then subtract the cost from the revenue.

First, let's find the total time spent by doctors. The hospital sees 500 people a day, and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. 

Total time spent by doctors = 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours.

Total time spent by doctors = 12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The doctors charge $150 an hour, so the total cost is:

Total cost = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

Now, let's find the total amount charged to patients. The hospital charges $200 an hour, and the total time spent is 12,000 minutes or 200 hours.

Total revenue = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost.

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
= $40,000 - $30,000
= $10,000

The hospital makes $10,000 profit from these visits."
"To find the number of elves left, we first need to determine the number of elves that quit after the children vomit on them. Since a third of the elves quit, we can calculate this as follows:

60 (initial elves) * 1/3 = 20 elves quit after being vomited on

Now, we subtract the elves that quit from the initial number to find the remaining elves:

60 - 20 = 40 elves remaining

Then, 10 more elves quit after being kicked by the kids. We subtract these from the remaining elves:

40 - 10 = 30 elves left

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total expenditure for the two months, we need to add the expenditure in May and June. 

The expenditure in May was $500. 
The expenditure in June was $60 less than May, so it's $500 - $60 = $440.

Now, let's add the expenditures for the two months: $500 + $440 = $940.

The final answer is: $940"
"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the total number of rides taken by Pam and Fred and then multiply it by the cost of each ride.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she took a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he took a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

The total number of rides taken by both Pam and Fred is 4 + 6 = 10 rides.

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is 10 * 6 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we first need to determine how many miles he walked on Tuesday. 

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. 
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, which is 4 * 6 = 24 miles.

Now, we know that his total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. We already know that he walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday. 

So, the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles. 

To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage for the three days: 41 - 28 = 13 miles.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how much Tom pays in a year, we need to calculate the total cost of car washes per month and then multiply it by 12.

Tom gets 4 car washes a month, and each car wash costs $15. 

The total cost per month is 4 car washes * $15/car wash = $60/month.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total cost per year is $60/month * 12 months = $720/year.

The final numerical answer is: $720"
"To find out how many video games Bobby has, we first need to determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5. 

Brian initially had 20 video games but lost 5, so he has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. To find out how many video games Bobby has, we multiply the number of video games Brian has by 3 and then subtract 5.

3 times the number of video games Brian has is 3 * 15 = 45.

5 fewer than 45 is 45 - 5 = 40.

Bobby has 40 video games.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we first need to find the total number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands = 27 * (1/3)
= 27 * 1/3
= 9

Now, we know that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. So, we can calculate the number of female Scottish unicorns as follows:

Number of female Scottish unicorns = 9 * (2/3)
= 9 * 2/3
= 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we need to calculate the cost of the items, add the delivery fee, and then add the tip.

First, let's calculate the cost of the items:
- 2 subs for $7.50 each: 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
- 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each: 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
- 2 cookies for $1.00 each: 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
Total cost of items: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, let's calculate the delivery fee: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00

Now, let's add the delivery fee to the total cost of the items: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, let's add the $5.00 tip: $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

The final answer is: $29.00"
"To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the total number of questions he was able to complete in each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions in each test.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 

First, let's find out how many questions Mark completed in 8 hours: 
8 hours * 5 questions per hour = 40 questions

Since Mark completed 40 questions in 8 hours, he left 75 - 40 = 35 questions incomplete in the first test.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at the same rate of 5 questions per hour.

Now, let's find out how many questions Mark completed in 6 hours: 
6 hours * 5 questions per hour = 30 questions

Since Mark completed 30 questions in 6 hours, he left 100 - 30 = 70 questions incomplete in the second test.

To find the total number of questions Mark left incomplete, we add the incomplete questions from both tests: 
35 (incomplete questions from the first test) + 70 (incomplete questions from the second test) = 105

The final answer is: 105"
"To find the number of pink gumballs, we need to first find four times the number of blue gumballs. 

Four times the number of blue gumballs is 4 * 12 = 48.

There are 22 more pink gumballs than four times the number of blue gumballs, so we add 22 to 48.

48 + 22 = 70

The number of pink gumballs is 70.

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine the total number of semi-automatic cars. 

Total number of cars = 20
Number of automatic cars = 12
Number of manual cars = 4

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Number of automatic cars + Number of manual cars)
= 20 - (12 + 4)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
= (4 / 20) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

"Let's break down the information given. 

Let's denote the number of baby bees as B, the number of worker bees as W, and the number of queens as Q. 

We know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B. 

We also know that there are twice as many babies as queens, so B = 2Q.

We can express the total number of bees in the hive as the sum of the number of worker bees, baby bees, and queens: 700 = W + B + Q.

Substituting the expressions for W and B in terms of Q, we get 700 = 2B + B + Q. 

Since B = 2Q, we can substitute this into the equation to get 700 = 2(2Q) + 2Q. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 700 = 4Q + 2Q, which is 700 = 6Q.

To find the number of queens, we divide both sides of the equation by 6: Q = 700 / 6.

Q = 116.67 (round down to 116 since you can't have a fraction of a queen)

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees: B = 2Q = 2 * 116 = 232.

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees: W = 2B = 2 * 232 = 464.

The final answer is: 464"
"To find out how much money Jordan would earn in one week, we need to calculate the total hours he would work in a week and then multiply that by his hourly wage.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day, if he spent that time working instead, he would work 2 hours a day. 

There are 7 days in a week, so the total hours he would work in a week is 2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week.

Jordan earns $10 an hour, so his weekly earnings would be 14 hours/week * $10/hour = $140/week.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of food items and non-food items separately and then add them together.

Food items: 
- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars
Total cost of food items: 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Non-food items: 
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars
Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax first.
Tax on non-food items: 10% of (3 + 3 + 4) = 10% of 10 = 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar
Total cost of non-food items: 3 + 3 + 4 + 1 = 11 dollars

Now, we add the cost of food items and non-food items together.
Total cost: 5 + 11 = 16 dollars

"To calculate the total profit, we first need to determine the total income and total expenses. 

Kim has 3 current clients and 5 potential clients, making a total of 8 clients. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. 

Total bottles of bleach needed per week: 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed per week: 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

The cost of bleach per week: 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
The cost of cloths per week: 8 packs * $5/pack = $40

Total expenses per week: $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72

Since Kim's total income per week is $92, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total income.

Profit per week = Total income - Total expenses
Profit per week = $92 - $72
Profit per week = $20

"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we first need to calculate the total number of pineapples in his field. 

Since John has 10 hectares of a pineapple field and there are 100 pineapples per hectare, we multiply the number of hectares by the number of pineapples per hectare:

10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples

Next, we need to determine how many times John can harvest his pineapples within a year. Since he can harvest every 3 months, there are 4 harvests in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests).

Now, we multiply the total number of pineapples by the number of harvests:

1000 pineapples * 4 harvests = 4000 pineapples

Therefore, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year.

The final answer is: 4000"
"To find the total number of blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each set and add them together.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return. So, 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees return.
3. The number of bees that have left but not returned is 30 - 15 = 15 bees.
4. In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the ones that left in the first 6 hours fly from the hive and leave. So, 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave.
5. The total number of bees that left but not returned is now 15 (from step 3) + 60 (from step 4) = 75 bees.
6. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. So, 75 bees return.

The cost of 1 adult ticket is $12 and the cost of 1 child ticket is $10. 

Total cost = cost of adult ticket + cost of child ticket
Total cost = $12 + $10
Total cost = $22

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, the amount she gave the cashier is the total cost plus the change.

Amount given to the cashier = Total cost + Change
Amount given to the cashier = $22 + $8
Amount given to the cashier = $30

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. 

Let's represent the number of friends Dorothy has as 'x'. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can represent Charlie's friends as 3x. We are given that Charlie has 12 friends, so we can set up the equation 3x = 12.

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3. This gives us x = 12 / 3, which simplifies to x = 4. 

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find the number of friends James has. We are told that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Since Dorothy has 4 friends, we can represent James' friends as 4 * 4 = 16.

"To find out who will win the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distance from miles to feet for both Steve and Tim. Since 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet, we can convert their distances as follows:

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school:

Steve's time: distance / speed = 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: distance / speed = 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes to get home and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will win the race. To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to subtract the winner's time from the loser's time:

Waiting time = Tim's time - Steve's time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Dave ate 14 french fries initially.
2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   Now, the total amount eaten by Dave and the seagull is 14 + 7 = 21 french fries.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 french fries.
   Now, the total amount eaten is 21 + 9 = 30 french fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries. Let's denote the initial amount of fries as 'x'. 
   After the seagull and pigeons ate, the remaining amount is x - 30.
   The raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is (2/3) * (x - 30).
   The remaining amount after the raccoon is (x - 30) - (2/3) * (x - 30).
   Simplifying this, we get (1/3) * (x - 30).
5. After the raccoon, ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 behind. 
   This means the remaining amount after the raccoon is 5 + 1 = 6 french fries.
   Setting (1/3) * (x - 30) = 6, we can solve for x.
   Multiplying both sides by 3, we get x - 30 = 18.
   Adding 30 to both sides, we get x = 48.

"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of the baguettes from feet to inches, since the lengths of the rolls and croissants are given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so each baguette is 2 * 12 = 24 inches long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches

Now, let's add the lengths together: 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12: 3360 / 12 = 280 feet

The monkeys need 200 bananas per month, the gorillas need 400 bananas per month, and the baboons need 100 bananas per month. 

Total monthly consumption = 200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas per month.

Since the zookeeper needs to order bananas for 2 months, we multiply the total monthly consumption by 2.

Total bananas needed for 2 months = 700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas.

The final answer is: 1400"
"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he's running back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. 

To find the total distance Kelly ran, we add the initial 200 yards to the distance she ran to the 40-yard line and back: 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Now, we compare the distances: Blake ran 3000 yards, and Kelly ran 2920 yards. Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

"To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin, we need to add the number of starfish, sea horses, and clownfish he caught. 

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 

Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Now, let's find the number of fish caught by Locsin. 

Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.

Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.

Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Now, let's find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin.

Total fish caught = Total fish caught by Anakin + Total fish caught by Locsin

"To find the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase every two months and add it to the original price.

The original price of the bag of marbles is $20.

After 2 months, the price increases by 20% of $20, which is 0.20 * $20 = $4. 
The new price after 2 months is $20 + $4 = $24.

After 4 months, the price increases by 20% of $24, which is 0.20 * $24 = $4.80.
The new price after 4 months is $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.

"To find the total worth of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then add them together.

The doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Since an action figure costs $5, the doll costs 3 * $5 = $15.

One red car costs $4. Since there are 5 red cars, the total cost of the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

The total cost of the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, we add the cost of the doll, the red cars, and the action figures together: $15 (doll) + $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) = $50.

The total worth of all the toys is $50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference in income between the two options.

If Jackie does her taxes herself, she'll lose $35/hour in missed income for 3 hours of freelance work. So, the total income lost is $35/hour * 3 hours = $105.

The cost of hiring the accountant is $90.

Now, let's calculate the difference in income between the two options. If Jackie hires the accountant, she won't lose any income from missed freelance work, so her income will be $0. If she does her taxes herself, she'll lose $105 in income.

The difference in income is $105 (lost income) - $90 (accountant's fee) = $15.

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

"To determine how many times Sandra has to babysit, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she needs for the Spanish flans and divide it by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs needed for 15 Spanish flans. Since each flan requires 3 eggs, we multiply 15 by 3:

15 * 3 = 45 eggs

Now, we know Sandra gets 9 eggs per babysitting job. To find out how many times she needs to babysit, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job:

45 eggs / 9 eggs per babysitting job = 5 babysitting jobs

So, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to get enough eggs for 15 Spanish flans.

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. We are given that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write an equation:

S = 2B

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This means that in 2 years, Seth's age will be S + 2 and Brooke's age will be B + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write another equation:

S + 2 + B + 2 = 28

Combine like terms:

S + B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

S + B = 24

Now we can substitute S = 2B into this equation:

2B + B = 24

Combine like terms:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to first determine what ""twice the money Ethel has"" is. Since Ethel has $8, twice that amount would be 2 * 8 = 16.

Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has, so we add 2 to the result we found: 16 + 2 = 18.

Jimmy has $18."
"To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he walks in a week. 

There are 7 days in a week. Pancho walks 20 miles a day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, he walks 20 * 5 = 100 miles from Monday to Friday. 

On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. So, he walks 10 * 2 = 20 miles on the weekends.

Now, let's add the miles he walks from Monday to Friday and the miles he walks on the weekends. 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants separately and then add them together.

The cost of the hat is given as $25.

The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so it is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. The average cost of the pants is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red.
2. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four.
3. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, and Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.

From point 3, we know Sally Four is 8 years old. 

From point 2, we can calculate Granny Red's age: 
Granny Red's age = 2 * Sally Four's age
Granny Red's age = 2 * 8
Granny Red's age = 16

From point 1, we can calculate Sally Two's age: 
Sally Two's age = Granny Red's age + 3
Sally Two's age = 16 + 3
Sally Two's age = 19

Now, we know the ages of Sally Four, Sally Two, and Granny Red. We still need to find the age of the fourth bird, but there's no information about the fourth bird's age. However, the question asks for the total age of the four birds. Since we have three of the four birds' ages, we can calculate the total age of the three birds we know and assume the fourth bird's age is unknown for now.

Total age of the three birds = Sally Four's age + Sally Two's age + Granny Red's age
Total age of the three birds = 8 + 19 + 16
Total age of the three birds = 43

Since we don't have information about the fourth bird's age, we can't calculate the total age of all four birds. However, the question seems to be asking for a numerical answer, so we'll assume the fourth bird's age is 0 for the sake of providing a numerical answer.

Total age of the four birds = Total age of the three birds + 0
Total age of the four birds = 43 + 0
Total age of the four birds = 43

"To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we first need to calculate the increased minimum payments for each debt. 

The minimum payment for the student loans is $300, so 50% more than that would be 1.5 * $300 = $450. 

The minimum payment for the credit card is $200, so 50% more than that would be 1.5 * $200 = $300. 

The minimum payment for the mortgage is $500, so 50% more than that would be 1.5 * $500 = $750.

Now, we add up the increased minimum payments for each debt: $450 + $300 + $750 = $1500.

To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12: $1500 * 12 = $18,000.

The final answer is: $18,000."
"To find the total time it takes Billy to peel and cut all the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes, then add the time it takes to cut one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds = 5/60 minutes (converting seconds to minutes)

Total time to peel all potatoes: 1.5 minutes * 60 potatoes = 90 minutes
Total time to cut all potatoes: (5/60) minutes * 60 potatoes = 5 minutes

Now, we add the time it takes to peel and cut all the potatoes: 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

However, we need to consider that the time it takes to cut a potato is much shorter than the time it takes to peel it. Since the time to cut a potato is negligible compared to the time to peel it, we can approximate the total time by just multiplying the time it takes to peel one potato by the total number of potatoes.

Approximate total time: 1.5 minutes * 60 potatoes = 90 minutes

The final answer is: 90"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much they made in total from selling lemonade and then subtract the cost of sugar to find the cost of lemons.

Let's start by finding the total revenue from selling lemonade. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Since they made $25 in profit, and we know that profit is revenue minus cost, we can set up an equation to find the total revenue. Let's denote the number of gallons as 'g'. The total revenue is $10g. The cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5. The total cost is $5g. The profit is $25, so we can write the equation as:

$10g - $5g = $25

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$5g = $25

Dividing both sides by $5, we get:

g = 5

Now that we know they made 5 gallons, we can find the total revenue:

Total revenue = $10g = $10 * 5 = $50

The cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $5, so the total cost is $5g = $5 * 5 = $25. The cost of sugar is $2 per gallon, so the cost of lemons is $5 - $2 = $3 per gallon.

The total cost of lemons is $3 * 5 = $15.

"To find the number of Chinese participants, we first need to subtract the number of Japanese participants from the total number of participants. 

Total participants = 240
Japanese participants = 80
Chinese participants = Total participants - Japanese participants

Chinese participants = 160

Now, we know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of girls on the Chinese team = Chinese participants - Number of boys
Number of girls on the Chinese team = 160 - 60
Number of girls on the Chinese team = 100

"To find out how much money Zaid has left after all his expenses and donations, we need to follow the order of operations.

First, let's calculate the amount Zaid spends on rent: 1/4 of his salary is 6000 * 1/4 = 1500 dollars.

Next, let's calculate the amount he spends on car fuel: 1/3 of his salary is 6000 * 1/3 = 2000 dollars.

Now, let's subtract the rent and car fuel expenses from his total salary: 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 dollars.

Since he donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity, we need to find half of 2500, which is 2500 * 1/2 = 1250 dollars.

Now, let's subtract the donation from the remaining amount: 2500 - 1250 = 1250 dollars.

Zaid gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars, so we need to subtract these amounts from the remaining amount: 1250 - 200 - 700 = 350 dollars.

Therefore, Zaid will have 350 dollars left after all his expenses and donations.

Total votes = 80
Winner's votes = 3/4 * Total votes
Winner's votes = 3/4 * 80
Winner's votes = 60

Now, to find the number of votes the loser got, we subtract the winner's votes from the total votes:

Loser's votes = Total votes - Winner's votes
Loser's votes = 80 - 60

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of white carnations and then calculate the number of red roses.

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Since Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations, we can write an equation:

200 = 5x

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations is 40, we can find the number of red roses. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we can write another equation:

Red roses = 4 * x
Red roses = 4 * 40
Red roses = 160

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

Let's denote Mark's current age as M and Jean's current age as J. We know that J = M + 2.

Two years ago, Mark was M - 2 years old, and Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old. We are also given that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. This can be written as:

M - 2 = (1/2) * 28 + 5

Simplifying the equation:

M - 2 = 14 + 5
M - 2 = 19
M = 21

Now that we know Mark's age, we can find Jean's age by adding 2 to Mark's age:

J = M + 2
J = 21 + 2

The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's total time is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, and then find the difference between these two probabilities.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is the probability of rolling a 4, 5, or 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5, since there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25 or 25%.

Now, we need to find the difference between the two probabilities. The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 50% and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 25%. The difference is 50% - 25% = 25%.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of small rodents (rats and hamsters) and the total number of straw pieces given to them. 

Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'r'. Since there are 3 cages of rats, the total number of rats is 3r. 

The total number of hamsters is 10. 

The total number of straw pieces given to rats is 3r * 6 = 18r. 
The total number of straw pieces given to hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50. 

The total number of straw pieces given to small rodents is 160. So, we can write the equation: 18r + 50 = 160.

Now, let's solve for 'r'. Subtract 50 from both sides of the equation: 18r = 110. 

Divide both sides by 18: r = 110 / 18. 

r = 6.11 (approximately), but since the number of rats must be a whole number, we need to find the closest whole number that satisfies the equation. 

Let's try r = 6: 18 * 6 = 108, which is less than 110. 

Let's try r = 7: 18 * 7 = 126, which is more than 110. 

Since r = 6 is the closest whole number to 6.11 and satisfies the equation, we can conclude that there are 6 rats in each cage.

"To find the number of bags the trader sold, we need to first calculate the total cost and total revenue. 

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The total cost of buying the bags is $20x (since each bag costs $20).
The total cost of transporting the bags is $2x (since each bag costs $2 to transport).
The total cost is the sum of the buying cost and the transportation cost: $20x + $2x = $22x.

The total revenue from selling the bags is $30x (since each bag is sold at $30).

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: $30x - $22x = $8x.

We are given that the profit is $400, so we can set up the equation: $8x = $400.

To find the number of bags, we can divide both sides of the equation by $8: x = $400 / $8.

x = 50

"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide it by 3.

First, let's find the cost of the food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. Since they spent $20.25 on tickets, the cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

The cost of the rides is 2 rides * $33 per ride = $66.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

Since they split the cost evenly, each friend paid $102 / 3 = $34.

"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ducks needs per day, we first need to calculate the total pounds of insects needed per week for the flock. 

Since there are ten ducks and each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, we multiply the number of ducks by the pounds of insects each duck needs per week: 
10 ducks * 3.5 pounds/duck/week = 35 pounds/week

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of insects the flock needs per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total pounds of insects needed per week by 7:
35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of trees Tom has after 10 years, considering the trees he plants, chops down, and the ones that die.

First, let's calculate the net change in the number of trees each year. Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2, so the net change is 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year.

Since Tom starts with 50 trees, we can calculate the total number of trees after 10 years by adding the net change to the initial number of trees 10 times:

50 + (8 * 10) = 50 + 80 = 130

However, after 10 years, 30% of the trees die. To find the number of trees that die, we multiply the total number of trees by 30% (or 0.3):

130 * 0.3 = 39

Now, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees to find the final number of trees:

130 - 39 = 91

So, Tom has 91 trees left.

91"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos on Sue's front yard.

On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out on Sue's front yard. So, now there are 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. Now, there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos.

The total number of flamingos on Sue's front yard is 30 pink + 6 white = 36 flamingos.

To find out how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how much change Violetta will get, we first need to determine how many crayons she can buy with $20. Since one crayon costs $2, we can divide the total amount she has by the cost of one crayon.

$20 ÷ $2 = 10 crayons

Since Violetta needs 5 different colors, we can assume she will buy 2 crayons of each color (although the problem doesn't specify this, it's a reasonable assumption). 

2 crayons per color * 5 colors = 10 crayons

Since Violetta can buy 10 crayons and she needs 10 crayons, she will spend all her money. 

The change she will get is $0."
"To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser, since a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. 

Cost of a pencil: $1.20
Cost of an eraser: $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser = $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens. 

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8 = $1.50 * 8 = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total pounds of carrots that will be used by the restaurants. 

Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. 

Total pounds of carrots used = Number of restaurants * Pounds per restaurant
Total pounds of carrots used = 40 * 2
Total pounds of carrots used = 80 pounds

Now, we subtract the total pounds of carrots used from the total pounds of carrots available to find out how many pounds will not be used.

Pounds of carrots not used = Total pounds of carrots - Total pounds of carrots used
Pounds of carrots not used = 200 - 80
Pounds of carrots not used = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the number of children in Soda, we need to subtract the total number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

First, let's add the number of men and women:
8417 + 9092 = 17509

Now, subtract the sum from the total population to find the number of children:
23786 - 17509 = 6277

The number of children in Soda is 6277."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times the number of cards she initially had: 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month: 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months: (60 + 40) * 2 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the total number of cards Elaine has: 20 (initial cards) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards.

The final answer is: 320"
"Let's break down the information given. Mark edits 1000 sentences each week, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, he also edits 1000 sentences for Publisher B.

We know that Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 2 * 5 cents = 10 cents per sentence.

Mark's total earnings from Publisher A are 1000 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 5000 cents.

Mark's total earnings from Publisher B are 1000 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 10000 cents.

Mark's total weekly earnings are 5000 cents + 10000 cents = 15000 cents.

The final answer is: 15000"
"To find the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the total number of pails he gets in a day and then multiply it by the amount of water in each pail.

Baldur gets 5 pails of water every morning and 6 pails of water every afternoon. So, the total number of pails he gets in a day is 5 + 6 = 11 pails.

Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, the total amount of water he gets every day is 11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters.

The final answer is: 55"
"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider both the one-time monetary reward and the 5% raise in salary.

First, let's calculate the total amount John earns from his weekly salary for the year. Since he makes $2000 a week and works every week of the year, we multiply his weekly salary by the number of weeks in a year (52).

Weekly salary: $2000
Number of weeks in a year: 52
Total salary for the year: $2000 * 52 = $104,000

Next, we need to calculate the 5% raise in salary. A 5% raise means John's new salary will be 105% of his original salary (100% + 5% increase).

Original salary: $2000
New salary: $2000 * 1.05 = $2100

Now, let's calculate John's total earnings for the year, including the one-time monetary reward of $5000.

Total salary for the year: $104,000
One-time monetary reward: $5000
Total earnings for the year: $104,000 + $5000 = $109,000

The final answer is: $109,000"
"To find the total number of barrels of wine produced per year, we need to calculate the total number of tons of grapes produced per year and then multiply it by the number of barrels of wine each ton produces.

First, let's find the total number of tons of grapes produced per year:
10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons

Next, let's find the total number of barrels of wine produced per year:
50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for the sandwiches, omelets, and macaroni and cheese separately and then add them together.

For the sandwiches, Carl ate 7 days' worth of sandwiches (since he ate one every day for a week) with 2 slices per sandwich. So, the total slices used for sandwiches is 7 * 2 = 14.

For the omelets, Carl ate 3 days' worth of omelets with 3 slices per omelet (since he used one more slice per omelet than per sandwich). So, the total slices used for omelets is 3 * 3 = 9.

For the macaroni and cheese, Carl used 8 slices.

Now, let's add the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and macaroni and cheese together: 14 + 9 + 8 = 31.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find out how many pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the total number of pens she initially had and then add the number of pens she bought.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so the total number of pens she had initially is 22 + 10 = 32.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag, so the total number of blue pens she bought is 6 * 9 = 54.

She also bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag, so the total number of red pens she bought is 2 * 6 = 12.

Now, let's add the number of pens she bought to the initial number of pens she had: 32 (initial pens) + 54 (blue pens) + 12 (red pens) = 98.

However, we also need to consider the green and yellow pens she initially had. We already added the pens she bought, but we didn't add the initial green and yellow pens to the total. Since she didn't buy any green or yellow pens, we can simply add the initial number of green and yellow pens to the total: 98 + 22 + 10 = 130.

So, Janet now has 130 pens. 

130"
"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to find the total score she needs for the semester. Since there are six tests and she wants an average of 93, we multiply the desired average by the number of tests: 93 * 6 = 558.

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest of the five scores she already has. The scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The lowest score is 71.

Now, we need to find the total score of the five tests, excluding the lowest score. We subtract the lowest score from the sum of the five scores: 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367. Then, 367 - 71 = 296.

Now, we add the score Brinley needs on the sixth test to the total score of the five tests, and set it equal to the total score needed for the semester: 296 + x = 558, where x is the score Brinley needs on the sixth test.

To find x, we subtract 296 from both sides of the equation: x = 558 - 296.

"To find the total number of kilometers Michael rode his bike, we need to calculate the total kilometers for the two different periods.

First, let's calculate the total kilometers for the first four weeks when he rode 25 kilometers each time, 5 times a week. 

Total kilometers in the first four weeks = 25 km * 5 times/week * 4 weeks = 25 * 5 * 4 = 500 km

Next, let's calculate the total kilometers for the next three weeks when he rode 60 kilometers each time, 2 times a week.

Total kilometers in the next three weeks = 60 km * 2 times/week * 3 weeks = 60 * 2 * 3 = 360 km

Now, we add the total kilometers from both periods to find the overall total.

Total kilometers = 500 km + 360 km = 860 km

"To find the total weight of the bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the weight of the chocolate bars. Since there are 25 chocolate bars and each weighs 40g, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 * 40g = 1000g

Next, let's find the weight of the candied apples. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, the weight of each candied apple is:
40g / 2 = 20g

Now, let's find the total weight of the candied apples:
80 * 20g = 1600g

Finally, let's add the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add the number of cakes she bought each day: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, half a dozen plates will cost 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

We are also given that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since there are 24 cups in a dozen, twenty dozen cups will be 20 * 24 = 480 cups.

To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups: $34,800 / 480 = $72.50.

The final answer is: $72.50"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy and the total amount of money she has earned so far. 

The total cost of the items is the cost of the jacket plus the cost of 2 pairs of shoes: 
$30 (jacket) + 2 * $20 (shoes) = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved before she started babysitting. She earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, so the total amount she has earned from babysitting is 4 * $5 = $20. 

The total amount of money Sara has is the sum of the money she already had and the money she earned from babysitting: 
$10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting earnings) = $30.

To find out how much more money Sara needs, we subtract the total amount she has from the total cost of the items: 
$70 (total cost) - $30 (total amount she has) = $40.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she must mow the lawn to earn the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by the amount she earns per lawn mowing: 
$40 (remaining amount) / $4 (lawn mowing earnings) = 10.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. We know that W = R + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42. Since each red chicken produces 3 eggs and each white chicken produces 5 eggs, we can set up the following equation:

3R + 5W = 42

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

R = 4

"To find the time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park since he walks around the edge. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the dimensions of the park, l = 6 miles and w = 1.5 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the perimeter by his speed:

Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of customers Sloane counted on the first day. Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so the number of customers on the second day is x + 50.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500, which is the sum of the customers from the first two days and the customers on the third day. Since the number of customers on the third day is the same as the number on the second day (because the problem doesn't mention any change in the number of customers on the third day), we can write the equation:

x + (x + 50) + (x + 50) = 500

Combine like terms:

2x + 100 = 500

Subtract 100 from both sides:

2x = 400

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 200

So, Sloane counted 200 customers on the first day. 

Now, we need to find the number of customers she counted on the third day. Since the number of customers on the third day is the same as the number on the second day, we can use the expression x + 50:

x + 50 = 200 + 50
= 250

"Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, the rate of water loss for both pools is 8 gallons/minute in total. 

In 4 minutes, the total water lost from both pools is 8 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 32 gallons.

The big pool initially had 2x gallons of water and lost 32 gallons in 4 minutes, so the amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 32 gallons.

The problem states that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as 'y'. Then, the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y.

We can set up the equation: 2x - 32 = 4y

Since the small pool initially had x gallons of water and lost some amount of water in 4 minutes, the current amount of water in the small pool is x - (some amount of water lost). However, we don't know the exact amount of water lost from the small pool. 

However, we can express the amount of water lost from the small pool as 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons. 

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is x - 16 gallons.

We can set up another equation: x - 16 = y

Now we have two equations:

We can solve these equations by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

From equation 2, we can express y as x - 16. 

Substituting y in equation 1: 2x - 32 = 4(x - 16)

Moving terms: 32 - 64 = 4x - 2x

Combine like terms: -32 = 2x

Divide by 2: -16 = x

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the current amount of water in the small pool by substituting x in equation 2: y = x - 16
y = -16 - 16
y = -32

The problem states that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as 'y'. Then, the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y.

We can set up the equation: 2x - 32 = 4y

Since the small pool initially had x gallons of water and lost some amount of water in 4 minutes, the current amount of water in the small pool is x - (some amount of water lost). However, we don't know the exact amount of water lost from the small pool.

However, we can express the amount of water lost from the small pool as 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons.

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is x - 16 gallons.

We can set up another equation: x - 16 = y

Now we have two equations: 
1) 2x - 32 = 4y
2) x - 16 = y

We can solve these equations by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

From equation 2, we can express y as x - 16.

Substituting y in equation 1: 2x - 32 = 4(x - 16)

Expanding the equation: 2x - 32 = 4x - 64

Moving terms: 32 - 64 = 4x - 2x

Combine like terms: -32 = 2x

Divide by 2: -16 = x

However, the initial amount of water in the pool cannot be negative. This indicates that the initial assumption of x being the initial amount of water in the small pool was incorrect.

Let's re-examine the problem. The initial amount of water in the small pool is x gallons. The big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, so the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, the rate of water loss for both pools is 8 gallons/minute in total.

In 4 minutes, the total water lost from both pools is 8 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 32 gallons.

The big pool initially had 2x gallons of water and lost 32 gallons in 4 minutes, so the amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 32 gallons.

"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and then divide that by her hourly wage.

The total cost of the items is the cost of the shoes plus the cost of the belt: $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00.

Now, we divide the total cost by Lori's hourly wage: $352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours.

"To find the remaining balance, we first need to calculate the total amount Janeth will pay in 12 months. 

Janeth pays $165 per month for 12 months, so the total amount she pays is:
$165 * 12 = $1980

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. The additional amount is 10% of $2000, which is:
$2000 * 0.10 = $200

So, the total amount Janeth needs to pay is $2000 (initial amount) + $200 (additional amount) = $2200

Since Janeth pays $1980 in 12 months, the remaining balance will be:
$2200 (total amount) - $1980 (paid amount) = $220

The final answer is: $220"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to determine the number of dahlias and add it to the number of roses. 

First, we know there are 4 roses. Then, we are told there are 7 more dahlias than roses. So, the number of dahlias is 4 (number of roses) + 7 (additional dahlias) = 11 dahlias.

Now, we add the number of roses and dahlias to find the total number of flowers: 4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the average age of the three in three years, we first need to find their current ages and then add 3 to each age. 

Given that Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is 2 * 21 = 42 years old.

Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, Adrian's age is 3 * 21 = 63 years old.

Now, we have the current ages of the three: Harriet (21), Zack (42), and Adrian (63). 

In three years, their ages will be: Harriet (21 + 3 = 24), Zack (42 + 3 = 45), and Adrian (63 + 3 = 66).

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3: (24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45.

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna. 

Naomi scored 68 points. 
Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 10 more than that is 34 + 10 = 44. 
Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi (68), Yuri (44), and Brianna (85). To find out Jojo's points, we subtract the points scored by the other three students from the total points. 
Total points = 251
Points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197
Points scored by Jojo = Total points - Points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna
Points scored by Jojo = 251 - 197

"To find out how much water is left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters, we subtract 90 from the initial 120 liters. 

120 - 90 = 30 liters

Since Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left, we multiply the remaining 30 liters by 2.

30 * 2 = 60 liters

The collected rainwater is added to the remaining 30 liters, so we add 60 to 30.

30 + 60 = 90 liters

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to calculate the number of petunias first. Since he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, we subtract 40 from the number of geraniums.

Number of geraniums: 90
Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Now, we add the number of geraniums and petunias to find the total number of flowers.

Total flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total flowers = 90 + 50
Total flowers = 140

"To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we first need to find the total number of cards James has after the changes. 

Initially, James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. 

After losing 8 water type cards, he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards.

After buying 14 grass type cards, he has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.

The total number of cards James has is 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 cards.

The probability of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, which is 32/96.

To find the percentage, we multiply by 100: (32/96) * 100 = 33.333...

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33."
"To find out how much Chad still owes, we need to calculate the total cost of his meal and then subtract the gift card amount.

The base burrito costs $6.50. 
He adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each, which is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50. 
So, the total cost of the add-ons is $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50.
The total cost of the meal before the upgrade is $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00.
He upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, so the new total is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.

"To find the total number of pieces Kalinda and her mom can place per minute, we need to determine how many pieces her mom can place per minute. Since her mom can place half as many pieces as Kalinda, and Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute, her mom can place 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

The total number of pieces they can place per minute is 4 (Kalinda) + 2 (her mom) = 6 pieces per minute.

To find the total time it will take to complete the puzzle, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place per minute. 

360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time from minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Therefore, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

"To find the number of melons not ready to be harvested after two weeks, we need to calculate the number of melons harvested in the two instances and subtract that from the total number of melons.

Initially, there were 120 baby watermelons. 

After two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest. 
30% of 120 is 0.3 * 120 = 36 melons. 
So, 36 melons were harvested after two months.

The remaining melons after two months are 120 - 36 = 84 melons.

After two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready for harvest. 
3/4 of 84 is (3/4) * 84 = 63 melons. 
So, 63 melons were harvested after two weeks.

The total number of melons harvested is 36 + 63 = 99 melons.

The number of melons not ready to be harvested after two weeks is 120 - 99 = 21 melons.

"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he writes and then multiply it by the time it takes him to write one page.

First, let's find out how many letters Mike writes in a week. He has 3 pen pals left, and each of them sends 2 letters a week. So, the total number of letters he receives is 3 * 2 = 6 letters.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages he writes in a week is 6 (letters received) + 6 (letters sent) = 12 letters * 5 pages/letter = 60 pages.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 60 pages * 6 minutes/page = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, 360 minutes / 60 = 6 hours.

Therefore, Mike spends 6 hours writing a week.

"To find out how many cookies Sue ate, we need to calculate her cookie consumption for both days. 

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies, so Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 13 cookies, so Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies.

Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday. Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories and her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the school. 

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60.

The total number of girls in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

We already know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

To find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the total number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls in the school: 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the total number of boys in the school is also 30. 

The total number of boys in the first two classes is 60 - 27 = 33 (since there are 60 students in total and 27 are girls). 

To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the total number of boys in the first two classes from the total number of boys in the school: 30 - 33 is incorrect, we need to find the number of boys in the first two classes, which is 60 - 27 = 33, but this is the total number of students in the first two classes, not the number of boys. We know that the first two classes have 27 girls, so they have 33 - 27 = 6 boys. 

Now, we subtract the number of boys in the first two classes from the total number of boys in the school: 30 - 6 = 24.

The number of boys in the third class is 24. 

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the current number of apps on Travis's tablet, we need to subtract the number of apps he deleted and add the number of apps he downloaded.

First, let's subtract the number of apps he deleted: 61 - 9 = 52

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how many cougars Rick killed today. We know he killed 15 cougars last night and three fewer cougars than the previous night. So, the number of cougars he killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Now, we know that Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today. Since he killed 12 cougars today, he killed 3 * 12 = 36 wolves.

We already know that Rick killed 10 wolves last night. So, the total number of wolves he killed is 10 + 36 = 46.

We also know that Rick killed 15 cougars last night. Since he killed 12 cougars today, the total number of cougars he killed is 15 + 12 = 27.

To find the total number of animals Rick killed, we add the number of wolves and cougars: 46 (wolves) + 27 (cougars) = 73.

The final answer is: 73"
"To find the floor Bill is on, we need to calculate 4 times his starting floor (3) plus 6.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we first need to determine how many times Anne went down the slide. 

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we need to calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30. 

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 

So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, so we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4.

21 * 4 = 84

Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

84"
"To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we first need to determine how many cows Mr. Sylas added to each stall. 

Initially, each stall had 20 cows. Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and divided them equally among the 10 stalls. 

To find out how many cows he added to each stall, we divide 40 by 10: 40 / 10 = 4. 

So, Mr. Sylas added 4 cows to each stall. 

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Each stall now has 20 (initial cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows. 

To find out how many cows are in 8 stalls, we multiply 24 by 8: 24 * 8 = 192.

The final answer is: 192"
"To find the total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill, and then add them together.

Next, let's calculate the value of the nickels:
40 nickels * $0.05 = $2.00

Now, let's calculate the value of the dimes:
20 dimes * $0.10 = $2.00

Finally, let's calculate the value of the dollar bills:
40 dollar bills * $1.00 = $40.00

Now, let's add up the values:
$1.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $40.00 = $45.00

The total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank is $45.00

$45.00"
"To find the total weight of the redwood tree, we first need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections. 

The redwood is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get the number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so we multiply the number of sections by the weight per section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

Now, we need to find 30% of the total weight that the termites ate. To do this, we multiply the total weight by 0.3 (which is the decimal equivalent of 30%): 8000 * 0.3 = 2400 pounds.

To find the remaining weight after the termites ate 30% of the wood, we subtract the weight eaten by the termites from the total weight: 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds.

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the total amount Nancy has to pay, we need to calculate the total cost of the overdue books and add the flat fee.

The cost of the overdue books is $0.50 per book, and she has 8 books. So, the total cost of the overdue books is 8 * $0.50 = $4.00.

In addition to the cost of the overdue books, there's a flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book that's over a week overdue. 

The total amount Nancy has to pay is the sum of the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee: $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples. So, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.
2. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.
3. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.
4. To find the total number of fruits, we need to add the number of apples and bananas that both Andrea and Jamal have. 
   Total fruits = (Andrea's apples + Jamal's apples + Andrea's bananas + Jamal's bananas)
   Total fruits = (52 + 44 + 24 + 48)
   Total fruits = 168

"To determine the total amount of flour needed, we need to calculate the amount needed for each day and then add them together.

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many cups are needed for 36 cookies. 

First, let's find out how many dozens are in 36 cookies: 36 / 12 = 3. So, Carla needs 3 dozen cookies. 

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 1 dozen cookies, Carla will need 3 * 2 = 6 cups of flour for today.

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. Again, we need to find out how many dozens are in 30 cookies: 30 / 12 = 2.5. Since we can't have half a dozen, we'll round up to the nearest whole number, which is 3. However, since 2.5 dozen is closer to 3 dozen than 2 dozen, we can use 2.5 dozen to calculate the flour needed. 

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 1 dozen cookies, Carla will need 2.5 * 2 = 5 cups of flour for tomorrow.

Now, let's add the flour needed for both days: 6 cups (today) + 5 cups (tomorrow) = 11 cups.

"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two-thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to first calculate two-thirds of 9,300 pennies.

Two-thirds of 9,300 is calculated as (2/3) * 9,300 = 6,200.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 pennies by $0.01 to get the total dollar amount.

6,200 * $0.01 = $62

The final answer is: $62"
"To find the total number of marbles Maddison has now, we need to calculate the total number of marbles she initially had and then add the marbles she received from her friend.

Maddison initially had 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each box. So, the total number of marbles she initially had is 5 * 50 = 250.

Then, she received 20 marbles from her friend. 

Now, we add the marbles she received to the initial total: 250 + 20 = 270.

So, Maddison now has 270 marbles."
"To find the number of trees in each yard, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Chris has 6 trees.
2. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has. 
   So, Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.
3. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has.
   First, we find twice the number of trees Ferdinand has: 2 * 3 = 6.
   Then, we add 5 to this number: 6 + 5 = 11.
   So, Harry has 11 trees.

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of trees between Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard.
The difference is 11 - 3 = 8.

"To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, then add them to the selling price.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500.

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

The total price of the house is the sum of the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

To find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price: $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

The final answer is: $9,500"
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid in fees and subtract that from the selling price, then subtract the remaining loan amount.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 is 0.03 x $400,000 = $12,000.

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 is 0.05 x $400,000 = $20,000.

The total fees paid by Mr. Tan is $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

Now, let's subtract the total fees from the selling price: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know it takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees. Then, it takes 40% longer to heat it up to 400 degrees. To find the additional time, we need to calculate 40% of 20 minutes. 

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. 

So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat the oil to 400 degrees. 

After warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. Since it took 28 minutes to warm up the oil, it will take 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook. 

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is the sum of the time it took to warm up the oil and the time it took to cook. 

Total time = 28 minutes (to warm up the oil) + 23 minutes (to cook) = 51 minutes.

"To find the total number of windows, we need to calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows in each house.

Each house has 3 bedrooms with 2 windows each, so the total number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is 3 * 2 = 6. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 6 * 2 = 12.

Each house has 4 additional windows not connected to bedrooms. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is 4 * 2 = 8.

The total number of windows in one house is 12 (from bedrooms) + 8 (additional) = 20. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows is 20 * 2 = 40.

"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we first need to determine the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette. 

The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is 900 * 0.1 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is a 1800-stitch project, the total number of stitches used for the body and the sleeves is 1800 - 270 = 1530 stitches.

The body takes 900 stitches, so the sleeves take 1530 - 900 = 630 stitches in total.

Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each scene and the song, and then add them together.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has (4/5) * 60 = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

First, we find the number of cards with the letter A: 2/5 of 80 is (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards.

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B. The remaining cards after A are 80 - 32 = 48. 1/2 of 48 is (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards.

Now, we find the number of cards with the letter C. The remaining cards after B are 48 - 24 = 24. 5/8 of 24 is (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards.

The total number of cards with the letters A, B, and C is 32 + 24 + 15 = 71.

"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we first need to determine their current ages. Since the sum of their ages is 20, we can represent their ages as x and 20 - x.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be x + 10 and Marco's age will be (20 - x) + 10.

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (x + 10) + ((20 - x) + 10).

Simplifying the expression, we get:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: R = 6S
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: (R + 9) = 3(S + 9)

We can substitute the first equation into the second one to solve for S:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 3S from both sides:

Number of cobras: 40
Spots per cobra: 70
Total spots on cobras: 40 * 70 = 2800

Since the mambas have half the number of spots as the cobras, we can find the number of spots per mamba by dividing the number of spots per cobra by 2.

Spots per cobra: 70
Spots per mamba: 70 / 2 = 35

Now, we can find the total number of spots on the mambas by multiplying the number of mambas by the number of spots per mamba.

Number of mambas: 60
Spots per mamba: 35
Total spots on mambas: 60 * 35 = 2100

To find the total number of spots on all the snakes, we add the total number of spots on the cobras and the mambas.

Total spots on cobras: 2800
Total spots on mambas: 2100
Total spots on all snakes: 2800 + 2100 = 4900

Finally, to find half the number of spots they all have combined, we divide the total number of spots by 2.

Total spots on all snakes: 4900

"To find out how many pizzas Maddy will need, we first need to calculate the total number of people attending the soccer game. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of people from the team and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. The total number of people attending the game is 15 (team and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we need to divide the total number of people by 3 to find out how many pizzas are needed. 39 / 3 = 13. 

Now, we know that Maddy needs 13 pizzas. Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost will be 13 * 15 = $195.

"To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we first need to calculate the total space occupied by the topaz gemstones and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace. 

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 of them, so the total space occupied by the gemstones is 8 inches. 

The remaining space for the sterling silver beads is 25 inches (total length of the necklace) - 8 inches (space occupied by gemstones) = 17 inches.

Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long, so the number of beads used can be calculated by dividing the remaining space by the length of each bead: 17 inches / (1/4 inch) = 17 / 0.25 = 68.

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

It's given that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have. 

Let's represent the total number of medals given out as 'x'. Then, we have the equation: 39 = x / 10. 

To find 'x', we multiply both sides of the equation by 10: x = 39 * 10.

x = 390

The final answer is: 390"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many chocolate bars are available in total. Since each packet contains 5 chocolate bars and there are 8 packets, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

We know that each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults. So, the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

Now, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars: 40 - 24 = 16.

Since there are 8 children, we need to divide the remaining chocolate bars equally among them. To do this, we divide 16 by 8: 16 / 8 = 2.

Therefore, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

First, let's find the total time she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the time to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:

150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval:

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

So, Susan earns $75 for the online task.

The final answer is: $75"
"To find the total points of all three players after the extra points are distributed, we first need to calculate their points after the fourth round.

Initially, Mike has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point. Now Mike has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
Jim has 18 points, so he doesn't get an extra point. Jim still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point. Now Tony has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's calculate the total points of all three players after the extra points are distributed:
Mike has 22 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points.
Total points = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83

The final answer is: 83"
"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we first need to determine how many oranges the sons washed. 

The oldest son is 8 years old, and he washes as many oranges as he is years old, so he washes 8 oranges. 

The youngest son is half as old as the oldest son, which means he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. He also washes as many oranges as he is years old, so he washes 4 oranges.

In total, the sons wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Since Will buys 15 oranges, and the sons wash 12, the number of oranges left unwashed is 15 - 12 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total count of activities, we need to calculate the number of each activity done on both days and then sum them up.

On the first day, Darren does:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

On the second day, he does:
- 20 more pushups than the first day, so 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 10 fewer squats than the first day, so 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- Doubles the number of dumbbell presses, so 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Now, let's calculate the total count of each activity over the two days:
- Total pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Total squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Total dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

The total count of activities is the sum of the total count of each activity: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370. 

The final answer is: 370"
"To find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then divide the total amount of rice available by that amount.

First, let's calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day. Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 3 meals per day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). Since 5 members of the household eat rice every lunch and dinner, we'll assume they also eat it for breakfast. So, the total number of people eating rice per day is 5.

Total rice consumed per person per day = 0.2 kg/meal * 3 meals = 0.6 kg/day
Total rice consumed by 5 people per day = 0.6 kg/day * 5 people = 3 kg/day

Now, let's calculate how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last:

Total rice available = 42 kg
Total rice consumed per day = 3 kg

Number of days a 42 kg bag of rice will last = Total rice available / Total rice consumed per day
= 42 kg / 3 kg/day
= 14 days

Since we want to find out how many weeks it will last, we'll divide the number of days by 7 (number of days in a week):

Number of weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last = 14 days / 7 days/week
= 2 weeks

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first need to calculate the total number of crates he sold in the week. 

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he sold bread for 5 days. 

He sold 20 crates over the weekend, which is 2 days. 
He sold 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday.

Total crates sold = 20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) = 65 crates

Since he was closed on Monday and Friday, he had 5 working days. His target for the week is 120 crates. 

To find out how many crates he should have sold in 5 days, we can divide the target by 7 and multiply by 5. 

Target per day = 120 / 7 = 17.14 (approximately)
Crates he should have sold in 5 days = 17.14 * 5 = 85.7 (approximately)

However, since we can't sell a fraction of a crate, we'll consider the nearest whole number. 

Crates he should have sold in 5 days = 86 crates

Now, let's find out how many crates he was off from his target. 

Crates he was off = Target - Crates sold = 120 - 65 = 55

So, Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week.

The final answer is: 55"
"To find the total cost of the desk, we need to determine the last bid made by Carmen. 

The initial bid is $200. The bids rise by $50 each time. Since there are 3 other people who bid once, there are a total of 4 people who bid before Carmen makes her final bid. 

The sequence of bids would be: $200, $250, $300, $350, $400, $450, $500. 

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she makes 4 bids. The last bid is $500. 

The total cost of the desk is the last bid, which is $500.

The final answer is: $500"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to find the total miles driven per year, the total bonus paid per year, and then add them together.

First, let's find the total miles driven per year. Since John goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, he goes to work 5 * 50 = 250 times per year. Since his work is 30 miles away and he has to go there and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 30 * 2 = 60 miles. Therefore, the total miles driven per year is 60 * 250 = 15,000 miles.

Next, let's find the total cost of driving per year. John is charged $2 per mile driven, so the total cost of driving per year is 15,000 * $2 = $30,000.

John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus paid per year is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

Now, let's add the total cost of driving per year and the total bonus paid per year to find the total amount John pays per year for driving: $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The final answer is: $31,800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to add the minutes he exercised on both days. 

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined minutes by 2.

Combined minutes: 39
Twice the combined minutes: 39 * 2 = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

The final answer is: 78"
"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process. 

When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two layers: the front and the back. 

For a 32-page tabloid, we need to have 32 pages in total. Since each piece of paper can have 2 pages (front and back), we can calculate the number of pieces of paper needed by dividing the total number of pages by 2.

32 pages / 2 pages per piece of paper = 16 pieces of paper

However, this is not the final answer because we need to consider the fact that the first and last pages are on the outside of the folded paper, and the remaining pages are on the inside. 

When we fold the paper, the first and last pages are on the outside, and the remaining 30 pages are on the inside. Since the first and last pages are on the outside, they are on separate pieces of paper. The remaining 30 pages are on the inside, and they can be printed on the same piece of paper as the first and last pages.

So, we need 3 pieces of paper: one for the first page, one for the last page, and one for the remaining 30 pages.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on food and snacks, and then subtract that from the initial amount she brought.

Annika spent half of $50 on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25.

She also spent an additional $10 on rides.

So, the total amount she spent is $25 (food and snacks) + $10 (rides) = $35.

Now, let's subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount she brought: $50 - $35 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Total books = 250
- Unsold books = 50
- Books sold this year = 45
- Books sold in the first year = 2 * Books sold this year = 2 * 45 = 90
- Books sold in the second year = Total books - Unsold books - Books sold this year - Books sold in the first year
= 250 - 50 - 45 - 90
= 65

Since each book sells at $20, the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
Total money earned in the second year = Books sold in the second year * Price per book
= 65 * 20
= 1300

The final answer is: $1300"
"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week: 
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Since Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

Since the company performed well for the whole month, Watson received a $300 bonus each week. 
So, his total weekly earnings are:
$500/week (hourly wage) + $300/week (bonus) = $800/week

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the month of April, which has 4 weeks:
$800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April."
"To find out how many people John lost to, we need to calculate 20% of the total number of people he arm wrestled, since he beat 80% of them.

"To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we first need to determine how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 

Two-thirds of 60 is calculated as (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves. 

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning. 

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

The total number of loaves produced is 60, and 40 are sold in the morning. 

60 - 40 = 20 loaves are left after the morning sales.

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. 

Half of 20 is calculated as (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are divided equally between the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses per week and then multiply that by the number of weeks it takes Sandy to lose the same amount of weight.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight Joey loses per week, we divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks:

Weight lost per week = Total weight lost / Number of weeks
Weight lost per week = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weight lost per week = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we multiply the weight lost per week by the number of weeks it takes Sandy:

Total weight lost = Weight lost per week * Number of weeks
Total weight lost = 2 pounds/week * 4 weeks
Total weight lost = 8 pounds

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $13 = $26. The discounted price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $11 = $22. The savings on 2 tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4 * $1 = $4. The discounted price of 4 packets of milk is 4 * ($1 - $0.5) = 4 * $0.5 = $2. The savings on 4 packets of milk is $4 - $2 = $2.

The total savings is $4 + $2 = $6.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of new arms and legs grown after 15 days.

The serum grows an extra arm every 3 days. To find out how many arms are grown in 15 days, we divide 15 by 3. 

15 / 3 = 5

So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

The serum grows an extra leg every 5 days. To find out how many legs are grown in 15 days, we divide 15 by 5.

15 / 5 = 3

So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount spent by Theo on the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket, and then subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount he has, and then subtract the amount he wishes to save.

First, let's calculate the total amount spent on business suits:
6 suits * $100 each = $600

Next, let's calculate the total amount spent on suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50 each = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. 
Cost of a business suit = $100
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
Cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's calculate the total amount spent on business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket:
$600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount he has:
$6000 (initial amount) - $1950 (total spent) = $4050

Finally, let's subtract the amount he wishes to save from the remaining amount:
$4050 - $2000 (amount to save) = $2050

"Let's break down the information given. 

Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is D/2.

We know that the total number of players on the team is 105. The sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams is equal to 105. 

So, we can write the equation: 2D + D + D/2 = 105.

To solve for D, we need to get rid of the fraction. Multiplying the entire equation by 2 will eliminate the fraction: 4D + 2D + D = 210.

Combining like terms, we get 7D = 210.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get D = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of people invited, we first need to calculate the number of people from the 2 families with 6 people and the 3 families with 4 people.

For the 2 families with 6 people, the total number of people is 2 * 6 = 12.
For the 3 families with 4 people, the total number of people is 3 * 4 = 12.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. So, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

Then, 1/4 of the people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments. 1/4 of 8 is 2. So, we subtract 2 from the number of people who couldn't come due to illness: 8 - 2 = 6.

Now, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come due to illness and previous commitments from the total number of people invited: 16 - 6 = 10.

"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, his father gave him 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 (initial marbles) + 20 (bought from Johanna) + 8 (given by his father) = 98 marbles.

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of marbles is 98 * 2 = 196 kgs.

Given that there are 30 boys, and the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:
Girls = 3 * Boys = 3 * 30 = 90

Next, we are told that the classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys. To find the number of nongendered children, we can multiply the number of boys by 1/10:
Nongendered children = 1/10 * Boys = 1/10 * 30 = 3

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
Total children = Boys + Girls + Nongendered children = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123

"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means for every 3 electric wires, there is 1 electric pole.

Given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles:

1 (electric pole) / 3 (electric wires) = x (electric poles) / 45 (electric wires)

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

1 * 45 = 3x
45 = 3x

Now, divide both sides by 3 to find x:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of people who left the party. We know that 1/4 of the total number of people left, and 22 men stayed. 

Let's denote the total number of people as 'x'. Since 1/4 of the people left, 3/4 of the people stayed. We can set up the equation:

3/4 * x = 22 + (number of women who stayed)

We know that the total number of people at the beginning was 25 men + 15 women = 40 people. So, x = 40.

Now, we can substitute x = 40 into the equation:

3/4 * 40 = 22 + (number of women who stayed)

30 = 22 + (number of women who stayed)

Subtract 22 from both sides:

8 = (number of women who stayed)

Since 1/4 of the people left, 1/4 of the total number of people left the party. The total number of people who left is 1/4 * 40 = 10.

We know that 22 men stayed, so the number of men who left is 40 - 22 = 18. 

The number of women who left is 10 - 18 = -8, which is not possible since we can't have a negative number of people. This means our initial assumption that 22 men stayed is incorrect.

However, we can try another approach. Let's assume that the number of men who left is 18. Then, the number of women who left is 10 - 18 = -8, which is still not possible.

Let's try again. If 18 men stayed, then the number of men who left is 40 - 18 = 22. This is the same as our initial assumption, so we can't use this approach.

However, if 19 men stayed, then the number of men who left is 40 - 19 = 21. The number of women who left is 10 - 21 = -11, which is still not possible.

If 20 men stayed, then the number of men who left is 40 - 20 = 20. The number of women who left is 10 - 20 = -10, which is still not possible.

If 21 men stayed, then the number of men who left is 40 - 21 = 19. The number of women who left is 10 - 19 = -9, which is still not possible.

If 17 men stayed, then the number of men who left is 40 - 17 = 23. The number of women who left is 10 - 23 = -13, which is still not possible.

If 16 men stayed, then the number of men who left is 40 - 16 = 24. The number of women who left is 10 - 24 = -14, which is still not possible.

If 15 men stayed, then the number of men who left is 40 - 15 = 25. The number of women who left is 10 - 25 = -15, which is still not possible.

If 14 men stayed, then the number of men who left is 40 - 14 = 26. The number of women who left is 10 - 26 = -16, which is still not possible.

If 13 men stayed, then the number of men who left is 40 - 13 = 27. The number of women who left is 10 - 27 = -17, which is still not possible.

If 12 men stayed, then the number of men who left is 40 - 12 = 28. The number of women who left is 10 - 28 = -18, which is still not possible.

If 11 men stayed, then the number of men who left is 40 - 11 = 29. The number of women who left is 10 - 29 = -19, which is still not possible.

If 9 men stayed, then the number of men who left is 40 - 9 = 31. The number of women who left is 10 - 31 = -21, which is still not possible.

If 8 men stayed, then the number of men who left is 40 - 8 = 32. The number of women who left is 10 - 32 = -22, which is still not possible.

If 7 men stayed, then the number of men who left is 40 - 7 = 33. The number of women who left is 10 - 33 = -23, which is still not possible.

If 6 men stayed, then the number of men who left is 40 - 6 = 34. The number of women who left is 10 - 34 = -24, which is still not possible.

If 5 men stayed, then the number of men who left is 40 - 5 = 35. The number of women who left is 10 - 35 = -25, which is still not possible.

If 4 men stayed, then the number of men who left is 40 - 4 = 36. The number of women who left is 10 - 36 = -26, which is still not possible.

If 3 men stayed, then the number of men who left is 40 - 3 = 37. The number of women who left is 10 - 37 = -27, which is still not possible.

If 2 men stayed, then the number of men who left is 40 - 2 = 38. The number of women who left is 10 - 38 = -28, which is still not possible.

If 1 man stayed, then the number of men who left is 40 - 1 = 39. The number of women who left is 10 - 39 = -29, which is still not possible.

If 0 men stayed, then the number of men who left is 40 - 0 = 40. The number of women who left is 10 - 40 = -30, which is still not possible.

However, we can try another approach. We know that 1/4 of the people left, so 3/4 of the people stayed. We can set up the equation:

3/4 * 40 = 22 + (number of women who stayed)

30 = 22 + (number of women who stayed)

Subtract 22 from both sides:

8 = (number of women who stayed)

However, this is the same as our initial equation, and we know that this is not possible since we can't have a negative number of people.

"To find the cost of the pen, we first need to determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, we know that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. So, the cost of the pen is $2 - $1 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find the total number of pencils Jam has, we know she has 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. Since we know the number of loose pencils, we can find the number of pencils in the boxes by subtracting the loose pencils from the total. 

26 (total pencils) - 2 (loose pencils) = 24 pencils in the boxes.

Since each box contains the same number of pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils in the boxes by the number of boxes to find the number of pencils in each box.

24 (pencils in boxes) / 3 (boxes) = 8 pencils per box.

Now, we know Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each, which is 3 * 8 = 24 pencils. We also know Meg has 46 pencils. To find the total number of pencils, we add the pencils Jam and Meg have.

24 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 70 pencils.

To find the number of boxes needed to store all the pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box.

70 (total pencils) / 8 (pencils per box) = 8.75 boxes.

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure all pencils fit. Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weakening effect of the ice cubes and the added cream.

Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and weakens it by 12 milliliters. Since the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, we need to find out how many ice cubes are required to achieve this. 

Let's assume the initial temperature of the coffee is 100 degrees (for simplicity). To cool it down to 35 degrees (100 - 65 = 35), we need to use ice cubes that cool the coffee by 13 degrees each. 

Number of ice cubes = (100 - 35) / 13 = 65 / 13 = 5

Each ice cube weakens the coffee by 12 milliliters, so 5 ice cubes will weaken it by 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters.

Now, let's consider the added cream. The coffee is weakened by 60 milliliters due to the ice cubes and 15 milliliters due to the cream. 

Total weakening = 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio. For every 2 old records, 1 new record is given. Since 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of new records as 7. 

Now, we need to find out how many old records were traded for these 7 new records. Since the trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record, we can multiply the number of new records by 2 to find the total number of old records traded.

Total old records = 7 new records * 2 = 14

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we first need to find the number of junior and senior programmers, and then calculate their respective salaries.

The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 100. 
2/5 * 100 = 40 junior programmers.

Since the number of senior programmers is the remaining 3/5 of the total number of employees, we can find it by subtracting the number of junior programmers from the total number of employees.
100 - 40 = 60 senior programmers.

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, who are paid $2000 per month. So, senior programmers are paid $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

Now, we can calculate the total salary for junior programmers:
40 junior programmers * $2000 = $80,000

And the total salary for senior programmers:
60 senior programmers * $2400 = $144,000

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the salaries of junior and senior programmers:
$80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000

The final answer is: $224,000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as 'x'.

Initially, there were x people on the bus.

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total number of people became x + 5.

At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the total number of people became (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2.

Then, 8 more people got in, so the total number of people became (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6.

We are given that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20, so we can set up the equation:

x + 6 = 20

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:

x = 20 - 6
x = 14

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.

He then passes 14 out to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.

On his way home, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. So now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

That night, he eats 3 more lollipops, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.

The next morning, he eats 2 more lollipops, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to first determine how many percentage points are left to charge. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more to be fully charged.

Given that the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it takes to charge the remaining 40% as follows:

40 percentage points / 1 percentage point per 3 minutes = 40 * 3 minutes

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to first calculate the total number of lollipops she has after her mother gives her 10 more. 

Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her 10 more, so Erin now has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.

Then, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella. To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we subtract 3 from 17. 

17 - 3 = 14

So, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip, apply the rewards and the coupon to the current shopping trip, and then find the final amount paid.

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip, which means they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards. 

On this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards. Since they had 4 rewards, they used $4 off the price. 

The coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is 2 * $4 = $8. 

So, the total discount applied is $4 (from rewards) + $8 (from the coupon) = $12.

The final amount paid is $43 (initial price) - $12 (total discount) = $31.

"To determine which job pays more, we need to calculate the net pay for each job.

For Job A, the total income is $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year. The total tax is 20% of $30,000, which is 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000. The net pay for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

For Job B, the total income is $42,000. The property tax is $6,000, so the net income before taxes is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. The tax on this is 10% of $36,000, which is 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600. The net pay for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

Since $32,400 is greater than $24,000, Job B pays more. To find the difference in net pay, we subtract the net pay of Job A from the net pay of Job B: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400"
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we first need to find the total number of ruined castles. 

40% of the castles are ruins, so we multiply the total number of castles by 0.4 (which is the decimal form of 40%):

Now, we know that half of the ruined castles are unmanned. To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we divide the total number of ruined castles by 2:
88 / 2 = 44

So, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

The final answer is: 44"

- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

For Cozy Homes' offer:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the price of the shares after the first year and then after the second year.

Initially, Maria buys 8 shares for $8 each, so the total cost is 8 * 8 = $64.

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price, we multiply the original price by 1.5 (100% + 50% = 150%, or 1.5 as a decimal). 

New price after the first year = 8 * 1.5 = $12.

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. To find the new price, we multiply the price after the first year by 0.75 (100% - 25% = 75%, or 0.75 as a decimal).

New price after the second year = 12 * 0.75 = $9.

Now, we multiply the new price after the second year by the number of shares to find the final value of Maria's shares.

Final value = 9 * 8 = $72.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as 'x'. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is 'x - 10'.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

Since the smallest group has 'x - 10' students, we can find the number of students in the smallest group by subtracting 10 from x:

x - 10 = 70 - 10

Divide both sides by 3:

c = 20

So, there are 20 cows and 2c = 40 chickens.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the weights of the other animals and then add them to the weight of the container.

Since the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, and it weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, we can conclude that the blue beetle and the green toad also weigh 50 pounds.

The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we can add the weights of all the animals and the container: 50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 50 (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 30 (red bird) + 20 (container) = 260 pounds.

Now, we add this to the original 5000 meters to find the new daily distance.

5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters

Since Tyson runs 6000 meters every day, and there are 30 days in June, we multiply the daily distance by the number of days in June to find the total distance covered in June.

6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters

The total distance Tyson covered in June is 180,000 meters.

180,000"
"To find the price difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B, we first need to determine the prices of both boxes. 

Juice Box A is 4 dollars. 
Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it is 4 + 5 = 9 dollars.
Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it is 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

Now, we need to find the difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B. 
The difference is 11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the total number of legs from the tables with 4 legs and the tables with 3 legs separately, and then add them together.

The tables with 4 legs have a total of 40 * 4 = 160 legs.

The tables with 3 legs have a total of 50 * 3 = 150 legs.

Now, we add the total number of legs from both types of tables: 160 + 150 = 310.

The total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310."
"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to first determine how many cookies are used by her son and her husband. 

Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so he eats 4 * 5 = 20 cookies per week. 

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats 1 * 7 = 7 cookies per week.

The total number of cookies used by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies per week.

Since each bag has 36 cookies, and 27 cookies are used by her son and husband, Jenny eats the remaining cookies. 

36 (total cookies in a bag) - 27 (cookies used by son and husband) = 9 cookies.

Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To find the total cost of the shirts, we first need to calculate the discount amount. 

The original price of each shirt is $30. 
The discount percentage is 40%. 
To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (as a decimal): 
$30 * 0.4 = $12

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the discounted price of one shirt: 
$30 - $12 = $18

Since Davos bought 2 shirts, we multiply the discounted price by 2 to get the total cost: 
$18 * 2 = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the percentage increase in the amount of money the factory is making per day, we need to first find the difference in the amount of money they are making per day now and the amount they used to make per day.

The factory used to make $100 per tractor and sold 10 tractors a day, so they made $100 * 10 = $1000 per day.

Now, they make $220 per silo and sell 5 silos a day, so they make $220 * 5 = $1100 per day.

The difference in the amount of money they are making per day now and the amount they used to make per day is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original amount and multiply by 100:

($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now. 

10%"
"To find out how much Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the monthly expenses first and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the monthly expenses for food. Since food costs $25 per week and there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly food cost is:
$25/week * 4 weeks/month = $100/month

Now, let's add the monthly costs of treats and medicine to the monthly food cost:
$100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total annual expenses for Madeline's dog are:
$220/month * 12 months/year = $2640/year

The final answer is: $2640"
"To find the total time spent on after-work activities, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and add them up.

- Monday's yoga class is 1 hour.
- Tuesday's cooking class is 3 times as long as Monday's yoga, so it's 1 * 3 = 3 hours.
- Wednesday's cheese-tasting event is 0.5 hours (half an hour).
- Thursday's museum tour is half as long as the cooking class, so it's 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours.
- Friday's errands are 2 hours.

Now, let's add up the time spent on each activity:
1 (Monday) + 3 (Tuesday) + 0.5 (Wednesday) + 1.5 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 7.5 hours.

The final answer is: 7.5"
"To find out how many plant pots April has left over, we first need to determine the total number of plant pots she needs. 

The school asked for 30 plant pots for the daisies. Since they asked for twice as many for the roses, we multiply 30 by 2 to get the number of plant pots needed for the roses. 

30 * 2 = 60

Now, we add the number of plant pots needed for the daisies and the roses to get the total number of plant pots needed. 

30 + 60 = 90

Since April had already bought 100 plant pots, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number she bought to find out how many she has left over.

100 - 90 = 10

So, April has 10 plant pots left over. 

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent from the initial amount she had. 

First, let's calculate the total amount she spent. She spent $11 on a sweater and gave her brother $4, so the total amount spent is $11 + $4 = $15.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount she had: $36 - $15 = $21.

Andrea saved $21."
"To find the total time John spent, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them up.

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming. 

He also watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

We are given that watching shows was 30% of the total time, so we can set up the equation: 30% of total time = 15 hours. 

To find the total time, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 30 / 100 = 0.3. 

Now we can set up the equation: 0.3 * total time = 15. 

To find the total time, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.3: total time = 15 / 0.3 = 50 hours.

We are also given that John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. To find the time spent sightseeing, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 40 / 100 = 0.4.

Now we can multiply the total time by the decimal to find the time spent sightseeing: 0.4 * 50 = 20 hours.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we first need to calculate how much money she has earned from both jobs. 

From her first job, she earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so she earns 10 * 20 = $200.

From her second job, she earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so she earns 5 * 15 = $75.

In total, Annabelle earns $200 + $75 = $275 from both jobs.

Since she already has $80 in her savings, we add the money she earned to her savings: $80 + $275 = $355.

The phone costs $400, so to find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we subtract the amount she has from the cost of the phone: $400 - $355 = $45.

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save $45.

The final answer is: $45"
"To find the height of the tallest tree, we first need to find the combined height of the two shorter trees. The shortest tree is 6 feet tall, and the second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so the second tree is 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall. 

The combined height of the two shorter trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet. 

Since the height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined, we multiply the combined height by 2: 17 * 2 = 34 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is 34 feet.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money he spent and then add the extra $10 his mother gave him.

First, let's calculate the total amount Dean spent on toy cars: 6 toy cars * $2 per toy car = $12.

Next, let's calculate the total amount Dean spent on teddy bears: 5 teddy bears * $1 per teddy bear = $5.

Now, let's add the cost of the toy cars and teddy bears to find the total amount Dean spent: $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially had $28. After spending $17, he had $28 - $17 = $11 left.

His mother then gave him an extra $10, so we add that to the $11 he had left: $11 + $10 = $21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost of the activities. 

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is 1 round * $5 per round = $5. 
Since there are 'x' friends, the total cost for mini-golf for all of them will be $5 + $5x.

The cost of arcade tokens for Morgan and her friends is $5. 
The cost of go-karts for Morgan and her friends is 2 rides * $10 per ride = $20. 
Since there are 'x' friends, the total cost for go-karts for all of them will be 2 * $10 * x = $20x.

The total cost for all activities is the sum of the costs for mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-karts: $5 + $5x + $20x.

We know that Morgan's dad has a budget of $90. So, we can set up the equation: $5 + $5x + $20x = $90.

Combine like terms: $5 + $25x = $90.

Subtract $5 from both sides: $25x = $85.

Divide both sides by $25: x = $85 / $25.

x = 3.4

Since we can't invite a fraction of a friend, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. 

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how much money Marisa saves in her piggy bank, we need to first calculate how much money she spends on lollipops each day and then subtract that from her daily pocket money.

Marisa buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, so the total cost of lollipops per day is:
4 lollipops * 25 cents/lollipop = 100 cents or $1

Since Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day, the amount she saves in her piggy bank per day is:
$5 (pocket money) - $1 (lollipops) = $4

Now, we need to find out how much she saves in 5 days:
$4 (daily savings) * 5 (days) = $20

So, Marisa puts $20 in her piggy bank if she saves for 5 days.

The final answer is: $20"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much change Billy has after buying the candy. 

Billy starts with $10. The candy costs $1.5 per pound. Let's call the number of pounds of candy he buys 'x'. The total cost of the candy is 1.5x. 

So, the change Billy has after buying the candy is 10 - 1.5x.

Next, Billy spends half of this change on gumballs. Since each gumball costs $0.05, the total cost of the gumballs is 0.05 * (40 / 2) = 1.

Since Billy spends half of his change on gumballs, we can set up the equation: (10 - 1.5x) / 2 = 1.

Now, let's solve for x. Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 10 - 1.5x = 2.

Now, let's isolate x. Subtract 10 from both sides: -1.5x = -8.

Now, divide both sides by -1.5: x = 8 / 1.5 = 16 / 3 = 5.3333.

However, since we are dealing with pounds of candy, we can round this to two decimal places. 

The final answer is: 5.33"
"Let's break down the information given. Carver's age is 45, and it's 5 years less than twice the age of his son. 

Let's represent the son's age as 'x'. According to the problem, 2x - 5 = 45. 

To find the son's age, we need to solve for 'x'. 

First, add 5 to both sides of the equation: 2x = 45 + 5
2x = 50

Next, divide both sides by 2: x = 50 / 2
x = 25

The son is 25 years old.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to add the distances between the three cities. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles. 
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. 
The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the sum of the first two distances, which is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. 
So, the distance from the third city to the first city is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

Now, we add the three distances together: 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is 3 * 300 = 900 miles.

To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance it can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the distance it travels in a day (900 miles).

18,000 / 900 = 20 days.

"To find the amount of stuffing needed for the collie beds, we first need to find the average amount of stuffing between the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds. 

The average amount of stuffing is (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we need to find the total amount of stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds. 

For the chihuahua beds, 4 beds * 2 pounds of stuffing per bed = 8 pounds of stuffing.

For the collie beds, 3 beds * 5 pounds of stuffing per bed = 15 pounds of stuffing.

The total amount of stuffing needed is 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time taken for the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the trip and add them together.

First, let's calculate the time taken for the trip to his friend's house. The distance is 200 miles and the speed is 70 mph. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 miles / 70 mph
Time = 2.857 hours (approximately)

However, he took a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. So, the actual distance traveled to his friend's house is 200 + 10 = 210 miles. 

Time taken for the detour = 10 miles / 70 mph
Time taken for the detour = 0.143 hours (approximately)

Total time taken to reach his friend's house = 2.857 hours + 0.143 hours
Total time taken to reach his friend's house = 3 hours

Now, let's calculate the time taken for the trip back home. The distance is 240 miles and the speed is 80 mph.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 240 miles / 80 mph
Time = 3 hours

Total time taken for the trip = Time taken to reach his friend's house + Time taken for the trip back home
Total time taken for the trip = 3 hours + 3 hours
Total time taken for the trip = 6 hours

"To find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we first need to find the total number of fourth-grade students present on Friday. 

Total fourth-graders = 96
Absent girls = 5
Absent boys = 4
Total absent students = 5 + 4 = 9

Total students present = Total fourth-graders - Total absent students
Total students present = 96 - 9
Total students present = 87

Now, we know that 43 out of the total 96 fourth-graders are girls. So, the number of fourth-grade boys is:
Total fourth-graders - Total girls = 96 - 43 = 53

Since we know that 4 boys were absent, the number of fourth-grade boys present on Friday is:
Total boys - Absent boys = 53 - 4
Total boys present = 49

The number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is 49.

"To find the total number of kids in the park, we need to determine the number of boys and then add it to the number of girls. 

Since there are twice the number of boys as girls, and there are 6 girls, we can calculate the number of boys by multiplying the number of girls by 2. 

Number of boys = 2 * 6 = 12

Now, we can find the total number of kids by adding the number of boys and girls.

Total number of kids = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of kids = 12 + 6
Total number of kids = 18

"Let's break down the information given:

1. 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 
   Since 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, four times that many is 4 * 3 = 12. 
   Four times that many minus 5 is 12 - 5 = 7. So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 
   Since 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting, three times that many is 3 * 7 = 21. 
   So, 21 customers were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.

Now, let's add up the number of customers kicked out for each reason:
- Refusing to wear masks: 3
- Shoplifting: 7
- Physical violence over goods on sale: 21

Total number of customers kicked out for these reasons = 3 + 7 + 21 = 31

Since a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:
50 - 31 = 19

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many points Erin has after scoring 14 points. We know that Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8. 

Let's denote the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points as x. After scoring 14 points, Erin will have x + 14 points. Since Erin now has three times more points than Sara, we can set up the equation:

x + 14 = 3 * 8

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 14 = 24

Subtracting 14 from both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 10

So, Erin had 10 points before scoring 14 points.

"To find the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. There are 44 seniors, and each picture frame costs $20. So, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of etching the logo on each picture frame. The etching costs an additional 20% of the cost of the picture frame, which is 20% of $20, or $4. So, the total cost of etching is 44 * $4 = $176.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the pins. 2 seniors will receive pins, and each pin costs $5. So, the total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the cords. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 officers. Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12. So, the total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we can add up the costs of the picture frames, etching, pins, and cords to find the total cost of the senior gifts. $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final answer is: $1198"
"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we first need to calculate the materials cost. Since the DIY saves 20% of the market price, the materials cost is 80% of the market price.

The market price is $400. 
To find 80% of $400, we multiply $400 by 0.8 (which is equivalent to 80%).
Materials cost = $400 * 0.8 = $320

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is the materials cost plus any additional costs (such as labor, time, etc.). However, since the problem doesn't mention any additional costs, we can assume the total cost is just the materials cost.

Total cost = $320

The final answer is: $320"
"To find the total number of shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs on Sunday, so we need to subtract those from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday. 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add up the total number of shoes sold over the three days: 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, we need to multiply the total number of pairs by 2 to get the total number of shoes sold. 50 * 2 = 100.

"To find the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to find the value of the faulty equipment. 

The total value of the equipment is $400,000. 40% of this is faulty. 

40% of $400,000 = 0.4 * $400,000 = $160,000

This means the faulty equipment is worth $160,000. 

To find the value of the functioning equipment, we subtract the value of the faulty equipment from the total value.

Value of functioning equipment = Total value - Value of faulty equipment
= $400,000 - $160,000
= $240,000

The total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000.

"To find out how much milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from the half of the sheep that gives 1 kg of milk and the half that gives 2 kg of milk.

First, let's find out how many sheep are in each half. Since Mary has 30 sheep, half of them would be 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

The first half of the sheep gives 1 kg of milk each, so the total milk from this half would be 15 * 1 = 15 kg.

The second half of the sheep gives 2 kg of milk each, so the total milk from this half would be 15 * 2 = 30 kg.

Now, let's add the milk from both halves to find the total milk collected every day. 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

"To find out how many pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we first need to determine how many rolls were left after feeding her children. Since she made a dozen (12) rolls and fed 6 to her children, we subtract 6 from 12 to get the number of rolls left.

12 (initial rolls) - 6 (rolls fed to children) = 6 rolls left

Since each of the remaining 6 rolls was broken into 8 pieces, we multiply 6 by 8 to find the total number of pieces fed to the chickens.

6 (rolls left) * 8 (pieces per roll) = 48

So, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

"To find the number of pupils who like the color yellow, we first need to determine the number of pupils who like blue, then the number of pupils who like green, and finally subtract the sum of these two from the total number of pupils.

First, half of the class likes blue. Since there are 40 pupils in the class, half of them would be 40 / 2 = 20 pupils who like blue.

Now, one-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. The remaining pupils after excluding those who like blue are 40 - 20 = 20. One-fourth of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5 pupils who like green.

Now, we subtract the sum of pupils who like blue and green from the total number of pupils to find the number of pupils who like yellow. The sum of pupils who like blue and green is 20 + 5 = 25. Therefore, the number of pupils who like yellow is 40 - 25 = 15.

"To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we need to calculate the number of apples picked each day and then add them together.

On Monday, we don't know the number of apples picked, but we do know that Lucy sold them all for $56 at $4 per apple. So, we can find the number of apples picked on Monday by dividing the total amount earned by the price per apple: $56 / $4 = 14 apples.

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, we can add the number of apples picked each day to find the total: 14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples.

"To find the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total interest paid over the five months and then divide it by the number of months. 

First, let's find the total interest paid over the five months. The formula for simple interest is: 

Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Here, Principal = $3,650, Rate = 10% or 0.10, and Time = 5 months.

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Interest = $1,825

Now, we need to add the interest to the principal to find the total amount Karan needs to pay back. 

Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $3,650 + $1,825
Total Amount = $5,475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by the number of months.

Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Number of Months
Monthly Payment = $5,475 / 5
Monthly Payment = $1,095

The final answer is: $1,095"
"To find out how many kilometers Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time. Cho hiked at 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours, so Cho hiked 14 * 8 = 112 kilometers.

To find out how many kilometers Chloe hiked, we need to multiply Chloe's speed by the time she hiked. Chloe hiked at 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours, so Chloe hiked 9 * 5 = 45 kilometers.

To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked than Chloe, we need to subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked. Cho hiked 112 kilometers and Chloe hiked 45 kilometers, so Cho hiked 112 - 45 = 67 kilometers farther.

The final answer is: 67"
"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the total number of silver pesos and gold pesos they have separately and then add them together.

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so Anna has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 + 100 = 150.

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so Anna has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos. The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 + 120 = 200.

The total number of pesos they have together is the sum of the total number of silver pesos and gold pesos, which is 150 + 200 = 350.

The final answer is: 350"
"To find the total profit per hour, we first need to determine the total revenue and the total cost.

Millie buys supplies for $18 to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups, so she can make 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade. 

She sells each cup of lemonade for $1, so the total revenue is 36 * $1 = $36.

The cost of making the lemonade is $18. 

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $36 - $18 = $18.

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, we need to find out how many hours it takes her to sell all the lemonade. Since she has 36 cups, and she sells 4 cups per hour, it will take her 36 / 4 = 9 hours to sell all the lemonade.

The profit per hour is the total profit divided by the number of hours, which is $18 / 9 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we can use the information that he sold 3/5 of his land and had 12.8 hectares left. 

Let's denote the initial amount of land as x hectares. Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he was left with 2/5 of his land, which is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation: (2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2 to isolate x:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land initially.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the number of female members in the choir, we first need to calculate 50% of the total members. Since 50% of the choir are girls, we can find this by multiplying the total number of members by 0.5.

Total members = 52
Number of girls = Total members * 0.5
Number of girls = 52 * 0.5
Number of girls = 26

Now, we know that half the people performing can't make it to the show. This means that half of the female members are performing, so the number of girls performing is half of 26.

Number of girls performing = Number of girls / 2
Number of girls performing = 26 / 2
Number of girls performing = 13

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. To find the total number of people performing, we add the number of girls performing to the number of teachers.

Total people performing = Number of girls performing + Number of teachers
Total people performing = 13 + 3
Total people performing = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores. 

First, we add up all the scores: 
65 + 94 = 159
159 + 81 = 240
240 + 86 = 326
326 + 74 = 400

Next, we divide the sum by the number of tests to find the average:
400 / 5 = 80

So, Wilson's current math grade is 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the erasers and the cost of the pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of 6 erasers is 6 * $2 = $12.
The cost of 8 pencils is 8 * $3 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of the erasers and the pencils together: $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu.

First, let's find out how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

The final answer is: 88"
"To find out how much money David saves, we need to calculate the cost of the rides for Dasha and compare it to the cost of the ride bracelet for David.

Each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, so the cost of one ride is 2 * $2 = $4.

Since they ride all 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha to buy tickets for all 9 rides is 9 * $4 = $36.

David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides. 

The cost of the rides for Dasha is $36, and the cost for David is $30. 

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract the cost for David from the cost for Dasha: $36 - $30 = $6.

David saves $6."
"To find out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to first determine the total number of gifts she has to wrap. 

Total gifts = gifts for family + gifts for friends + gifts for teachers
Total gifts = 6 + 4 + 2
Total gifts = 12

Since Monica wants to make a bow for each gift, she will need to make 12 bows in total. 

Now, we need to find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each bow. To do this, we divide the total amount of ribbon by the total number of bows.

Total ribbon = 144 inches
Total bows = 12

Ribbon per bow = Total ribbon / Total bows
Ribbon per bow = 144 / 12
Ribbon per bow = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we first need to find out how many popsicles each of them has. 

Let's assume the number of popsicles Betty has is 5x and the number of popsicles Sam has is 6x. 

Since the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, we can write the equation: 5x + 6x = 165

Combine like terms: 11x = 165

Divide both sides by 11: x = 15

Now that we know x, we can find the number of popsicles each of them has. Betty has 5x = 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles. Sam has 6x = 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total cost of the streaming services, we need to calculate the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus. 

The normal cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, so together they cost $20. However, Tim saves 20% by bundling them. 

20% of $20 is 0.2 * $20 = $4. 

So, the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16. 

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (bundled Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

Since Tim was paying $60 for the cable package, he saves $60 - $26 = $34 by cancelling his cable subscription.

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total time spent, we need to add up the time spent writing, recording, and editing the song. 

Time spent writing: 4 hours
Time spent recording: 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours
Time spent editing: 90 minutes = 1.5 hours

Total time spent = 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours

Now, let's find the percentage of time spent editing. 
Percentage = (Time spent editing / Total time) * 100
= (1.5 / 7.5) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of books Wendy wants to place, we first need to determine the number of books in the shelving system and then add 20 more than double that amount.

The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so the total number of books it can hold is 6 * 6 = 36.

Now, we need to find double the number of books in the shelving system, which is 2 * 36 = 72.

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books, so we add 20 to 72: 72 + 20 = 92.

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

The final answer is: 92"
"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica has now, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, added to the cards her dad brought, and then subtract the cards she passed out and add the cards she received.

Initially, Erica had 20 Valentine's cards. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards that had 15 cards each, so she received 2 * 15 = 30 cards. 

Now, Erica has 20 (initial cards) + 30 (cards from her dad) = 50 cards.

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so she gave away a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

She received 17 cards from family and friends.

To find out how many cards Erica has now, we need to subtract the cards she gave away and add the cards she received: 50 (total cards) - 29 (cards given away) + 17 (cards received) = 38.

So, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find out how many slices are left, we first need to determine how many slices Jenny gave away. 

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, we can calculate the number of slices Bill received as follows:

1/3 * 12 = 4 slices

Jenny gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. We can calculate the number of slices Mark received as follows:

1/4 * 12 = 3 slices

In total, Jenny gave away 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny ate 2 slices, so the total number of slices she gave away or ate is 7 + 2 = 9 slices.

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total number of slices given away or eaten from the total number of slices:

12 - 9 = 3 slices

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many days Mark needs to save his money, we need to divide the cost of the bike by his daily earnings.

Cost of the bike: $300
Daily earnings: $10

Number of days = Cost of the bike / Daily earnings

= 30

So, Mark needs to save his money for 30 days to buy the bike.

30"
"To find the total number of bugs, we first need to find the number of millipedes and stink bugs. 

Nancy saw 90 spiders. Since there are 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders, we can find the number of millipedes by multiplying the number of spiders by 1/3. 

Number of millipedes = 90 * (1/3) = 30

Next, we need to find the number of stink bugs. The number of stink bugs is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. 

Number of stink bugs = 2 * 30 - 12 = 48

Now, we can find the total number of bugs by adding the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs.

Total number of bugs = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168

The final answer is: 168"
"To find the difference between Alice's and Erica's ages, we first need to determine Alice's age. Since Beth is 5 years older than Erica, and Erica is 30 years old, Beth's age is 30 + 5 = 35 years.

Since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, Alice's age is 35 + 7 = 42 years.

The difference between Alice's and Erica's ages is 42 - 30 = 12 years.

"To find out how much the builder earns in a year, we first need to calculate his daily earnings and then multiply it by the total number of days he works in a year.

The builder works 6 days a week and 4 weeks a month, so the total number of days he works in a month is 6 * 4 = 24 days.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of days he works in a year is 24 * 12 = 288 days.

The builder gets paid $50 every day, so his daily earnings are $50.

Now, we multiply his daily earnings by the total number of days he works in a year to find his yearly earnings: $50 * 288 = $14,400.

The final answer is: $14,400"
"To find out how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for the quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, we multiply the ingredients by 4:

- Flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
- Milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark will need to buy:
12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark will need to buy:
4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the original energy consumption and the new energy consumption. 

The original energy consumption is 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh) per day. 

Since 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) is equal to 1000 watts * 1 hour, we can convert the original energy consumption to kWh: 7200 Wh / 1000 = 7.2 kWh per day.

If Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, the new energy consumption is 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh per day. Converting this to kWh: 2700 Wh / 1000 = 2.7 kWh per day.

The energy saved per day is the original energy consumption minus the new energy consumption: 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh per day.

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily energy saved by 30: 4.5 kWh/day * 30 days = 135 kWh.

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the average number of stripes, we first need to calculate the total number of stripes and then divide it by the total number of zebras.

There are two zebras with 17 stripes each, so that's 2 * 17 = 34 stripes.
There's a zebra with 36 stripes.
There's another zebra with half the number of stripes as the third zebra, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

The total number of stripes is 34 + 36 + 18 = 88.
The total number of zebras is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.

To find the average number of stripes, we divide the total number of stripes by the total number of zebras: 88 / 4 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we first need to calculate the total number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves:

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we need a total of 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so the total cost of the meat is:
5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so the total cost of the cheese is:
5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is the sum of the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese:
$35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

The final answer is: $50.00"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find the initial number of corns and the new number of cannolis and corns after Allan's purchase.

Since Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis initially, and he has 40 cannolis, the initial number of corns is 2 * 40 = 80.

Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, so the number of corns he bought is 60 - 40 = 20.

The total number of cannolis after the purchase is 40 + 60 = 100.

The total number of corns after the purchase is 80 + 20 = 100.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 + 100 = 200.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first calculate the total steps he completed before the jog. 

Elliott finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since he wants to walk 10,000 steps, half of that would be 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. 

He also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. 

So, before the jog, Elliott completed 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Since he had 2,000 steps left to take after the jog, we can find out how many steps he took during the jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the total steps he wanted to take. 

10,000 (total steps) - 6,000 (steps completed before jog) = 4,000 steps left to complete. However, he only had 2,000 steps left after the jog. This means the jog must have contributed to the remaining steps. 

So, the steps taken during the jog would be 4,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 steps.

The final answer is: 2000"
"To find out how many minutes Toby will be early, we need to calculate the total time it takes for him to read the book and travel to the airport.

First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book: 
45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words

Since Toby can read 300 words per minute, we can calculate the time it takes for him to read the book:
9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, so the total time it takes for Toby to finish the book and get to the airport is:
30 minutes (reading time) + 10 minutes (travel time) = 40 minutes

Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, so we subtract the total time it takes for him to finish the book and get to the airport from the time he has to be there:
60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

Therefore, Toby will be 20 minutes early. 

20"
"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we first need to calculate the total number of employees and the total hours worked.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. 

The total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 hours * $15 per hour = $2400.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees left is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30 employees.

Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks in June, so the total hours worked by each employee in June is 40 * 4 = 160 hours.

The total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 hours * $15 per hour = $2400.

The total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 employees * $2400 = $96000.

The total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 employees * $2400 = $72000.

The total amount paid to all employees in the two months is $96000 + $72000 = $168000.

The final answer is: $168000"
"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds and the sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off,"" we can consider it as a 2-pound purchase with a discount on the second pound. The first pound costs $3, and the second pound is half off, which is $3 * 0.5 = $1.5. So, the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.5 = $4.5.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. She bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $4.5 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total amount spent by Tim, we first need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks and the finale firework.

The first package of fireworks costs $400. The second package costs twice as much, so it's 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packages. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 0.20: $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

The discount amount is subtracted from the total cost of the packages: $1200 - $240 = $960.

The finale firework costs $150. 

The total amount spent by Tim is the sum of the discounted cost of the packages and the cost of the finale firework: $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we first need to calculate how many cookies she eats in 30 days. 

Since Shannon eats 2 cookies per night, we multiply the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of nights in 30 days. There are 30 nights in 30 days. 

2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since Shannon wants to have enough cookies for 30 days, we need to make sure she has at least 60 cookies. 

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies needed by the number of cookies per recipe. 

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen cookies

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days. 

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. 

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the candles have this defect, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of candles that smell like wet dog = Total number of candles * (Percentage of candles with the defect / 100)
= 50000 * (5 / 100)
= 2500

Now, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. Since Marcy guarantees that 99% of the candles will not explode, the percentage of candles that will explode is 1% (100% - 99%). However, this 1% is out of the total number of candles, not the number of candles that smell like wet dog. 

To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find 1% of the number of candles that smell like wet dog:

Number of candles that smell like wet dog and explode = Number of candles that smell like wet dog * (Percentage of candles that will explode / 100)
= 2500 * (1 / 100)
= 25

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is 4 * $14 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.
- The combined total of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is 30 + 60 + 15 + 45 = 150 apples.
- Since the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - 150 = 350 apples.
- Since Joanne gathers some apples from the average trees, we need to find out how many apples she gathered from the average trees. Let's denote the number of apples she gathered from the average trees as x.
- The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 30 (from the tallest trees) + 15 (from the shortest trees) + x (from the average trees) = 45 + x.
- The total number of apples gathered by her sister is 60 (from the tallest trees) + 45 (from the shortest trees) = 105 apples.
- The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so 45 + x + 105 = 500.
- Solving for x, we get x = 500 - 150 = 350.

However, this is the total number of apples gathered from the average trees by both sisters. Since the problem asks for the number of apples gathered by Joanne from the average trees, we need to find out how many apples she gathered from the average trees. Let's denote the number of apples she gathered from the average trees as y.
- The total number of apples gathered by Joanne from the average trees is y.
- The total number of apples gathered by her sister from the average trees is 350 - y.
- The combined total of apples gathered from the average trees is 350, so y + (350 - y) = 350.
- Solving for y, we get y = 350 - y + y, which is not correct. We need to re-evaluate the equation.
- The correct equation is: 45 + x + 105 = 500, where x is the total number of apples gathered from the average trees by both sisters.
- We already know that x = 350, but this is the total number of apples gathered from the average trees by both sisters. To find the number of apples gathered by Joanne from the average trees, we need to find the ratio of apples gathered by Joanne from the average trees to the total number of apples gathered from the average trees by both sisters.
- Since Joanne gathers some apples from the average trees, we can assume that the number of apples she gathered from the average trees is a fraction of the total number of apples gathered from the average trees by both sisters.
- Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees as y. The number of apples her sister gathered from the average trees is 350 - y.
- The ratio of apples gathered by Joanne from the average trees to the total number of apples gathered from the average trees by both sisters is y / (y + (350 - y)) = y / 350.
- Since Joanne gathers some apples from the average trees, we can assume that the ratio of apples gathered by Joanne from the average trees to the total number of apples gathered from the average trees by both sisters is equal to the ratio of apples gathered by Joanne from the tallest trees to the total number of apples gathered from the tallest trees by both sisters.
- The ratio of apples gathered by Joanne from the tallest trees to the total number of apples gathered from the tallest trees by both sisters is 30 / (30 + 60) = 30 / 90 = 1 / 3.
- Since the ratio of apples gathered by Joanne from the tallest trees to the total number of apples gathered from the tallest trees by both sisters is 1 / 3, the ratio of apples gathered by Joanne from the average trees to the total number of apples gathered from the average trees by both sisters is also 1 / 3.
- We can set up the equation y / 350 = 1 / 3.
- Solving for y, we get y = 350 / 3 = 116.67.

However, the number of apples gathered by Joanne from the average trees must be a whole number. We need to re-evaluate the equation.
- The ratio of apples gathered by Joanne from the tallest trees to the total number of apples gathered from the tallest trees by both sisters is 30 / (30 + 60) = 30 / 90 = 1 / 3.
- The ratio of apples gathered by Joanne from the shortest trees to the total number of apples gathered from the shortest trees by both sisters is 15 / (15 + 45) = 15 / 60 = 1 / 4.
- Since the ratio of apples gathered by Joanne from the tallest trees to the total number of apples gathered from the tallest trees by both sisters is 1 / 3, and the ratio of apples gathered by Joanne from the shortest trees to the total number of apples gathered from the shortest trees by both sisters is 1 / 4, we can assume that the ratio of apples gathered by Joanne from the average trees to the total number of apples gathered from the average trees by both sisters is 1 / 2.
- We can set up the equation y / 350 = 1 / 2.
- Solving for y, we get y = 350 / 2 = 175.

The final answer is: 175"
"Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. We know that each camel has 2 humps and each dromedary has 1 hump. The total number of humps is 304, so we can write the equation:

2C + D = 304

We also know that the total number of heads (camels and dromedaries) is 180, so we can write another equation:

C + D = 180

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve for C and D by subtracting the second equation from the first:

2C + D - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know C, we can substitute it into the second equation to find D:

124 + D = 180
D = 56

So, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd.

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down the information given.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is 4 * 200 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers. So, the total distance covered in the next two days is 240 kilometers.

On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance covered is 0 kilometers.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance covered in the second week is 7 * 300 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, let's add up the distances covered in each segment: 
- First 4 days: 800 kilometers
- Next two days: 240 kilometers
- Next day: 0 kilometers
- Second week: 2100 kilometers

Total distance = 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

The final answer is: 3140"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work backwards from Peter's locker size. 

Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can find Zack's locker size by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4. 

Zack's locker size = 5 * 4 = 20 cubic inches.

Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can find Timothy's locker size by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size = 20 * 2 = 40 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the elevation where Stanley's comb fell, we need to subtract the distance it fell from Stanley's initial elevation. 

Stanley's initial elevation: 10,000 feet
Distance the comb fell: 4,000 feet
Elevation where the comb fell: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation where the comb fell and Oliver's elevation to determine how much Oliver needs to climb.

Elevation where the comb fell: 6,000 feet
Oliver's elevation: 3,000 feet
Distance Oliver must climb: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

The final answer is: 3000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know that the first bank gave Mr. Josue $4000. 

The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so the second bank gave him 2 * $4000 = $8000.

Now, let's add the money from both banks to the initial capital: $4000 + $8000 = $12,000.

Adding this to the initial capital of $5000, we get: $12,000 + $5000 = $17,000.

So, Mr. Josue now has $17,000 in capital.

The final answer is: $17,000."
"To find the number of cats left on the rock, we first need to determine the number of cats taken away by the boats and then subtract that from the initial number of cats. 

Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats taken away by the boats is 4 * 5 = 20.

Now, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30.

After the boats left, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find the number of cats that ran after the mouse, we multiply the remaining cats by 3/5: 30 * (3/5) = 18.

Now, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12.

The final number of cats left on the rock is 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different periods and calculate the cost for each period.

1. The first 6 months were $8 a month, so the cost for this period is 6 * $8 = $48.
2. The next 8 months were $12 a month, so the cost for this period is 8 * $12 = $96.
3. After that, the price increased to $14 a month. Since 2 years is 24 months, and we've already accounted for 14 months, there are 24 - 14 = 10 months left. The cost for this period is 10 * $14 = $140.
4. Now, we add up the costs for each period: $48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284.

The final answer is: $284"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let the cost of the jogger jeans be x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the cost of the tattered jeans is x + 6.

The total savings is $6, and Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. This means that 1/3 of the total savings is the savings from the jogger jeans, and 2/3 of the total savings is the savings from the tattered jeans.

The savings from the jogger jeans is 1/3 * 6 = 2. The savings from the tattered jeans is 2/3 * 6 = 4.

Since the savings from the tattered jeans is $4, the cost of the tattered jeans is 28 - 4 = 24.

Now we know that the cost of the tattered jeans is 24 and the cost of the jogger jeans is x. We also know that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so x = 24 - 6 = 18.

The difference in cost between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is 24 - 18 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then add them together.

The capacity of the 4 buses is 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
The capacity of the 6 minibusses is 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
The capacity of the 10 minivans is 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, we add the capacities together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The final answer is: 570"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many birds each type of feeder attracts and then add them up.

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each. Lillian's homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Lillian has 3 homemade feeders and 3 store-bought feeders. The total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders is 3 * 30 = 90 birds. The total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60 birds.

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is 90 + 60 = 150 birds.

"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

The bagel costs $4. 
The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, which is 4 + (4 * 0.25) = 4 + 1 = $5.

The cake is half the price of the bagel, which is 4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: 4 (bagel) + 5 (soup) + 2 (cake) = 11.

The total cost of Aleksandra's dinner is $11.

The final answer is: $11"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cards Kenny sold to get the remaining $50. Since he sold the cards for $1.5 each, we can divide the remaining money by the price per card to find the number of cards sold.

Let's denote the total number of cards as 'x'. Since Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards, he sells 2/3 of them. The number of cards sold is 2/3 * x.

The money he gets from selling the cards is 2/3 * x * $1.5. This is equal to the remaining $50.

We can set up the equation: 2/3 * x * $1.5 = $50

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2 to get rid of the fraction: x * $1.5 = $50 * 3/2

x * $1.5 = $75

Now, we can divide both sides by $1.5 to find x: x = $75 / $1.5

x = 50

So, Kenny started with 50 cards.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, the caterer prepared enough hot dogs for half of the guests to have two hot dogs. Since there are 36 guests, half of them would be 36 / 2 = 18. So, the caterer prepared enough hot dogs for 18 guests to have two hot dogs each.

This means the caterer prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hot dogs for the first 18 guests. However, since the caterer prepared enough for 18 guests to have two hot dogs, the total number of hot dogs prepared is 36.

Now, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog. This means that the 18 guests who were initially supposed to have two hot dogs got their second hot dog, and the remaining 22 guests (40 - 18 = 22) also got a second hot dog.

However, the caterer only prepared 36 hot dogs. Since 18 guests got two hot dogs each, that's 36 hot dogs. The remaining 22 guests also got a second hot dog, but there are not enough hot dogs for them.

Since there are 36 hot dogs, and 18 guests got two hot dogs each, that's 36 hot dogs. The remaining 18 hot dogs are for the 22 guests who also got a second hot dog. This means that 18 out of the 22 guests who got a second hot dog did not get a second hot dog because there were not enough hot dogs.

However, the question asks how many guests did not get a second hot dog. Since the 18 guests who were initially supposed to have two hot dogs got their second hot dog, and the remaining 22 guests also got a second hot dog, the only guests who did not get a second hot dog are the 2 guests who were not accounted for in the initial 36 hot dogs.

"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we first need to find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Indras has 6 letters in her name. Half of 6 is 3. 

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

The total number of letters in both names is 6 (Indras) + 7 (her sister) = 13.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount and then apply the 20% discount.

The total cost of the items before the discount is:
- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- 5 separate utensils: 5 * $5.00 = $25.00
Total cost before discount: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Now, we need to apply the 20% discount to the total cost. To do this, we multiply the total cost by 0.20 (which is the decimal equivalent of 20%):
$165.00 * 0.20 = $33.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final cost:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

The final answer is: $132.00"
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and subtract the amount of money she already has.

The total cost of the items is: $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19.

Dora has a total of $2 (her allowance) + $16 (from her mother) = $18.

To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 (total cost) - $18 (amount she has) = $1.

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

"To find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to first determine how many dragons Prince Arthur and Prince Walter slew, and then calculate one-fifth of that number.

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons. Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, which is 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, which is 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, which is 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to determine how much gas was in each container. Since 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5.

15 gallons / 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

Since Josey needed 1/4 of a container, we multiply the amount of gas in one container by 1/4.

3 gallons/container * 1/4 = 0.75 gallons

To convert gallons to pints, we know that 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints. 

0.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George had initially. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can set up an equation to find the initial amount.

Let's denote the initial amount of money George had as 'x'. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can write the equation as:

x - 5 = 0.01x

To solve for x, we can add 5 to both sides of the equation:

x = 5 / (1 - 0.01)
x = 5 / 0.99
x = 5.05

So, George had $5.05 initially.

Now, let's find out how much he spent on chips. He bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so the total amount spent on chips is:

3 * 0.40 = $1.20

Since he spent $5 in total, the amount spent on candy bars is:

5 - 1.20 = $3.80

Now, we can find out how many candy bars he bought by dividing the total amount spent on candy bars by the cost of each candy bar:

3.80 / 0.75 = 5.07

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can see that 5 candy bars would cost 3.75, and 6 candy bars would cost 4.50, so the amount spent on candy bars is between 5 and 6. Therefore, George must have bought 5 candy bars.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to first determine how many lollipops he shared with his friends. 

Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself, so he shared 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops with his friends.

Since he shared the lollipops equally among his four friends, we need to divide the number of lollipops he shared by the number of friends: 20 / 4 = 5.

So, each of his friends received 5 lollipops.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the remaining weight of the cake, we first need to determine how much of the cake was eaten. Since Rory and her mom each had a piece, that's 2 pieces in total. 

The cake was cut into 8 pieces, and 2 were eaten, so 8 - 2 = 6 pieces are left. 

Since the cake weighs 20 ounces and it was cut into 8 equal pieces, we can find the weight of each piece by dividing the total weight by the number of pieces: 20 ounces / 8 = 2.5 ounces per piece.

Now, we multiply the weight of one piece by the number of remaining pieces: 2.5 ounces * 6 = 15 ounces.

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"To find out how many oranges each person will get, we first need to determine the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have. 

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. 

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56

Since they are sharing the oranges with 6 other friends, including themselves, the total number of people sharing the oranges is 8 (Sitti, Juris, and 6 friends).

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people.

Oranges per person = Total oranges / Total people
= 56 / 8
= 7

So, everyone will get 7 oranges. 

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the cost per serving, we first need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients. 

Antoine wants to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which costs 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Since the soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater and then calculate how much earlier she needs to leave than Wayne.

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, we can calculate Bernadette's drive time as follows:

Bernadette's drive time = 4 * Wayne's drive time
= 4 * 4 minutes
= 16 minutes

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, we need to calculate how much earlier she needs to leave than Wayne. 

Let x be the time Wayne leaves. Then Bernadette needs to leave x - 5 minutes before Wayne. 

The time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater is 16 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

x - 5 + 16 = x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

11 = x

However, this is the time Wayne leaves. We need to find the time Bernadette leaves, which is x - 5. 

Bernadette's departure time = x - 5
= 11 - 5
= 6 minutes

So Bernadette needs to leave 6 minutes before Wayne to get to the theater first.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. Since the area of the room is given as 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. 

1 yard = 3 feet, so 3 yards = 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length * Width. 

360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the width, we can find the perimeter of the room using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The final answer is: 98"
"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister has.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, let's find the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters:
Difference = Total beads Margareth has - Total beads Elizabeth has
= 140 - 60
= 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the final temperature of the house, we need to calculate the temperature increase due to the oven and the temperature decrease due to the open window.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour, and Marcus bakes for 3 hours. So, the total temperature increase is 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the open window. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are there in 30 minutes. 30 minutes / 10 minutes = 3 intervals. So, the total temperature decrease is 2 degrees/interval * 3 intervals = 6 degrees.

Now, let's subtract the temperature decrease from the temperature increase: 15 degrees (increase) - 6 degrees (decrease) = 9 degrees.

The initial temperature of the house was 40 degrees. So, the final temperature is 40 degrees + 9 degrees = 49 degrees.

The final answer is: 49"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took James to complete each segment of the triathlon. 

Let's start with the swim. Since James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, and Jon took 40 minutes, we can calculate James' swim time as follows:

James' swim time = Jon's swim time - (10% of Jon's swim time)
= 40 - (0.1 * 40)
= 40 - 4
= 36 minutes

Next, we know that James took 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. Since Jon took 1 hour and 20 minutes (or 80 minutes) for the bike ride, we can calculate James' bike time as follows:

James' bike time = Jon's bike time + 5 minutes
= 80 + 5
= 85 minutes

Now, let's find out how long it took Jon to complete the triathlon. We know that Jon took 40 minutes for the swim, 80 minutes for the bike ride, and 50 minutes for the run. So, the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon is:

Jon's total time = 40 + 80 + 50
= 170 minutes

We are given that Jon won by 10 minutes, which means James took 10 minutes longer than Jon to complete the triathlon. Therefore, James' total time is:

James' total time = Jon's total time + 10 minutes
= 170 + 10
= 180 minutes

Now, we can find out how long it took James to complete the run by subtracting his swim and bike times from his total time:

James' run time = James' total time - James' swim time - James' bike time
= 180 - 36 - 85
= 59 minutes

The final answer is: 59"

"To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

First, let's find out how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is half an hour. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32 MPH * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, and it ran 16 miles, the total hay consumed is:
Total Hay = 16 miles * 1/2 bail/mile
Total Hay = 8 bails

Each bail costs $3, so the total cost of the hay is:
Total Cost = 8 bails * $3/bail
Total Cost = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:
Total Money = 6 * $5
Total Money = $30

Now, let's find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay:
Change = Total Money - Total Cost
Change = $30 - $24
Change = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total, we need to calculate the number of eggs from the cases and the loose eggs separately. 

4 dozen eggs is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 eggs. 
Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Since each glass needs 5 eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs by 5 to find out how many glasses of eggnog Rozanne can make. 
50 eggs / 5 eggs per glass = 10 glasses.

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, so we can divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays Rozanne can put out. 
10 glasses / 5 glasses per tray = 2 trays.

The salesman sold the remaining 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers to the department store for $25 each. The total revenue from the department store is:
31 * $25 = $775

The total revenue from all sales is:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The cost of the case of 48 sneakers is $576. To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the total revenue:
$1115 - $576 = $539

The salesman's profit is $539.

The final answer is: $539"
"To find the total number of crayons Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the total number of crayons in the six packets with eight pieces each and the four packets with sixteen pieces each.

First, let's calculate the total number of crayons in the six packets with eight pieces each:
6 packets * 8 crayons/packet = 48 crayons

Next, let's calculate the total number of crayons in the four packets with sixteen pieces each:
4 packets * 16 crayons/packet = 64 crayons

Now, we add the total number of crayons from both types of packets to find the overall total:
48 crayons + 64 crayons = 112 crayons

The final answer is: 112"
"Let's break down the information given. 

If you buy the super ticket for $20, you get one popcorn and a soda for $1 extra. This means the total cost for the super ticket, popcorn, and soda is $21. 

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the cost of the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda without the super ticket is $21 - $2 = $19.

The cost of the movie ticket is $12, so the cost of the popcorn and soda is $19 - $12 = $7.

The cost of the soda is $3, so the cost of the popcorn is $7 - $3 = $4.

The final numerical answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as 'x'. Since the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, we can set up the equation:

20x = 900

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

x = 900 / 20
x = 45

So, the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost of filling one balloon is:

New cost = Original cost + Increase
New cost = 45 + 20
New cost = 65

Now, we need to find the total cost of filling 170 balloons at the new rate. 

Total cost = New cost per balloon * Number of balloons
Total cost = 65 * 170
Total cost = 11050

The final answer is: 11050"
"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 mph x 2 hours = 120 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour:
Distance = Speed x Time = 30 mph x 1 hour = 30 miles

Now, let's find the total distance traveled:
Total Distance = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

The total time taken is the sum of the time taken at 60 mph and 30 mph:
Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Finally, we can calculate the average speed:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires and rubies separately and then add them together.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. Each sapphire is worth $800, so the total value of her sapphires is 8 * $800 = $6400.

She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. This means she now has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left. The value of the sapphires she traded is 3 * $800 = $2400.

The value of the 2 rubies she received is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is the sum of the value of the sapphires and the rubies: $6400 + $2400 - $2400 = $6400.

The total value of Jenna's jewels is $6400."
"To find the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of apples they eat per day and then multiply it by 30.

Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. So together, they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples per day.

Now, we multiply the total number of apples they eat per day by 30 to find the total number of apples they eat in 30 days: 8 * 30 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds. 

The volume of one raised bed is calculated as length * width * height. 
Volume = 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is 10 * 32 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. To find the total number of bags needed, we divide the total volume of soil needed by the volume of one bag. 
Number of bags = 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is the number of bags multiplied by the cost per bag. 
Total cost = 160 * 12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of cards, we first need to determine the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of red cards = 15
60% of red cards = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

The final answer is: 78"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies.

After 20 minutes, one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. This means her friend saw 50 / 2 = 25 fairies. So, the total number of fairies now is 50 + 25 = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. To find the remaining number of fairies, we subtract 30 from 75: 75 - 30 = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the total number of puppies with spots, we need to add the number of puppies with spots from Jennifer's and Brandon's dogs. Jennifer has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon has 4 puppies with spots. So, the total number of puppies with spots is 3 + 4 = 7.

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies. Jennifer has 8 puppies, and Brandon has 12 puppies. So, the total number of puppies is 8 + 12 = 20.

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to divide the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100. 

(7 / 20) * 100 = 35

The final answer is: 35"
"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and add them together.

The total weight of sugar cubes is 2 boxes * 1 pound per box = 2 pounds.

The total weight of carrots is 4 bags * 12 pounds per bag = 48 pounds.

The total weight of hay is 42 bales * 75 pounds per bale = 3150 pounds.

The total weight of oats is 20 sacks * 65 pounds per sack = 1300 pounds.

The total weight of all the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds.

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight of the feed by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips needed.

3400 pounds / 2250 pounds per trip = 1.51 trips.

Since we can't make a fraction of a trip, the farmer will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the total earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the earnings from aluminum cans. Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week, and each can is worth 2 cents. So, her weekly earnings from aluminum cans are 3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week. 

For a four-week month, her earnings from aluminum cans would be 6 cents/week * 4 weeks = 24 cents.

Next, let's calculate the earnings from plastic bottles. Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week, and each bottle is worth 3 cents. So, her weekly earnings from plastic bottles are 5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week.

For a four-week month, her earnings from plastic bottles would be 15 cents/week * 4 weeks = 60 cents.

Now, let's add the earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles to find the total earnings. Total earnings = 24 cents (aluminum cans) + 60 cents (plastic bottles) = 84 cents.

"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we first need to determine how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate Toni's plants as follows:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find out how many plants Shondra has. Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, so:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

"To find out how many students Miss Maria has, we first need to calculate the total number of cards she has. 

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, so the total number of basketball cards is 6 * 25 = 150.

She has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200.

The total number of cards is the sum of basketball and baseball cards, which is 150 + 200 = 350.

Since Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, the number of cards she gives to her students is 350 - 50 = 300.

Each student gets 10 cards, so the number of students is 300 / 10 = 30.

"To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples for both of them.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each and received a $1 discount. 
First, we calculate the total cost of the apples: 20 * 0.45 = $9. 
Then, we subtract the discount: $9 - $1 = $8.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each and received a 10 percent discount. 
First, we calculate the total cost of the apples: 20 * 0.50 = $10. 
Then, we calculate the discount: 10% of $10 is 0.1 * $10 = $1.
Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $10 - $1 = $9.

Now, we compare the costs: Kelly paid $9 and Becky paid $8. 
The difference is $9 - $8 = $1.

"To find the total number of pieces of laundry, we need to calculate the number of each type of laundry and then add them up.

Each room has 2 sheets. So, for 80 rooms, the total number of sheets is 2 * 80 = 160.

Each room has 1 comforter. So, for 80 rooms, the total number of comforters is 1 * 80 = 80.

Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, which means each room has 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases. So, for 80 rooms, the total number of pillow cases is 4 * 80 = 320.

Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, which means each room has 2 * 4 = 8 towels. So, for 80 rooms, the total number of towels is 8 * 80 = 640.

Now, let's add up the total number of each type of laundry: 160 (sheets) + 80 (comforters) + 320 (pillow cases) + 640 (towels) = 1200.

"To find out how many pans of cupcakes Mary should bake, we first need to determine how many cupcakes she can decorate with the sprinkles she has. Since each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and she has 6 jars, we multiply the number of jars by the number of cupcakes per jar.

6 jars * 8 cupcakes/jar = 48 cupcakes

Now, we need to find out how many pans of cupcakes she should bake. Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes per pan.

48 cupcakes / 12 cupcakes/pan = 4 pans

So, Mary should bake 4 pans of cupcakes to use up all of her sprinkles.

"Let's break down the problem. Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is 'x'. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, which is x/2. He also gets two extra cookies for cleaning his room. So, the total number of cookies he gets is x/2 + 2.

We are given that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x/2 + 2 = 5.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: x/2 = 5 - 2, which simplifies to x/2 = 3.

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: x = 3 * 2, which simplifies to x = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert their individual lengths to feet and then add them together. 

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 6 inches to feet by dividing by 12. 

6 inches / 12 = 0.5 feet

Since there are two remoras, we multiply the length of one remora by 2.

0.5 feet * 2 = 1 foot

Now, we add the length of the remoras to the length of the shark.

10 feet (shark) + 1 foot (remoras) = 11 feet

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy, we divide the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100.

(1 foot / 10 feet) * 100 = 10%

"To find the total number of students, we need to determine the number of students with desktop computers and then add the number of students without desktop computers.

Since three-fourths of the students have desktop computers, one-fourth do not have desktop computers. We know that 20 students do not have desktop computers, which is one-fourth of the total number of students.

Let's represent the total number of students as 'x'. Since one-fourth of the students do not have desktop computers, we can set up the equation:

1/4 * x = 20

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by 4:

x = 20 * 4
x = 80

So, there are 80 students at that grade level.

"To find out how many days Jason has to break in the shoes, we need to multiply the number of days he has (21 days, since there are 7 days in a week and he has 3 weeks) by the number of days he walks per week (4 days). 

21 days * 4 days/week = 84 days

Since it takes 240 minutes to break in the shoes, we need to divide the total number of days by the number of days he walks per week to find out how many days he has to walk to break in the shoes. However, we actually need to find out how many minutes he has to walk each day.

To find the total number of minutes he has to walk, we multiply the number of days he has to walk by the number of minutes it takes to break in the shoes. 

84 days * 240 minutes/day = 20160 minutes

Now, we need to divide the total number of minutes by the number of days he walks per week to find out how many minutes he has to walk each day.

20160 minutes / 4 days/week = 5040 minutes/week

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to divide the total number of minutes per week by 7 to find out how many minutes he has to walk each day.

5040 minutes/week / 7 days/week = 720 minutes/week

However, we need to find the daily minutes, not the weekly minutes. So, we need to divide the weekly minutes by the number of days he walks per week.

720 minutes/week / 4 days/week = 180 minutes/day

"To find out how many books each child got, we need to first determine the total number of books Sarah bought. Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can divide the total amount spent by the cost of each book.

Total amount spent = $300
Cost of each book = $15

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost of each book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by 4 to find out how many books each child got.

Number of books per child = Total number of books / 4
Number of books per child = 20 / 4
Number of books per child = 5

"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to find the total number of kids allergic to at least one thing and subtract that from the total number of kids in the class.

First, let's find the total number of kids allergic to at least one thing. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to do this.

Number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts = (Number of kids allergic to dairy) + (Number of kids allergic to peanuts) - (Number of kids allergic to both)
= 9 + 6 - 3
= 12

However, this counts the kids allergic to both twice, so we need to subtract them once to avoid double-counting.

Number of kids allergic to at least one thing = 12

Now, we can find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything by subtracting the number of kids allergic to at least one thing from the total number of kids in the class.

Number of kids not allergic to anything = Total number of kids - Number of kids allergic to at least one thing

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to determine the weight of the 2010 penny. 

Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight by multiplying the weight of the 1959 penny by 3/4.

Weight of 1959 penny = 48 grains
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48 grains
Weight of 2010 penny = 36 grains

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their individual weights.

Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny
Combined weight = 48 grains + 36 grains
Combined weight = 84 grains

Now, let's divide the sum by 3:
-30 / 3 = -10

The average highest temperature of the three countries is -10 degrees Fahrenheit."
"To find out how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we need to calculate the remaining amount first. 

The toy car costs $12, and the child already has $4. So, the remaining amount is $12 - $4 = $8.

The child promises to save $2 daily from his allowance. To find out how many days it will take to save the remaining amount, we can divide the remaining amount by the daily savings.

$8 (remaining amount) ÷ $2 (daily savings) = 4 days

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we need to calculate the total capacity of the trays and subtract the number of eggs he has.

Each tray can hold 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays. So, the total capacity of the trays is 24 * 2 = 48 eggs.

Jaime has 64 eggs, but the trays can only hold 48 eggs. To find out how many eggs won't fit, we subtract the capacity from the total number of eggs: 64 - 48 = 16.

So, Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the tray.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total amount Sally spent, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza first. Since it costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, we multiply the cost of the small pizza by 3.

Cost of small pizza: $8
Cost of family-size pizza: $8 * 3 = $24

Now, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount spent.

Total amount spent: $8 + $24 = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"To find the cost per individual razor after the discount, we need to calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and coupon applied.

First, let's calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors at the sale price. Since it's buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. 

Now, let's apply the $2.00 coupon to the cost of 1 pack. The new cost is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since Heather buys 2 packs, but only pays for 1 pack, the total cost is $2.00.

Now, let's find the total number of razors in 2 packs. 2 packs * 4 razors per pack = 8 razors.

To find the cost per individual razor, we divide the total cost by the total number of razors. $2.00 * 100 cents/dollar = 200 cents. Now, divide the total cost in cents by the total number of razors: 200 cents / 8 razors = 25 cents per razor.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each level and add them up.

The 4 girls on the bottom are 64"" tall each, so their total height is 4 * 64 = 256"".

The 3 girls on top of the 4 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 3 * 64 = 192"".

The 2 girls on top of the 3 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 2 * 64 = 128"".

The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, we add up the heights of all the levels: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 536"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 536"" / 12 = 44.67 feet.

The final answer is: 44.67"
"To find the total number of minutes Charisma walked, we need to calculate the total number of 5-minute breaks she took in a day and then multiply it by the number of days she worked.

Charisma works 8 hours a day, and she takes a 5-minute break every hour. So, the total number of 5-minute breaks in a day is 8 hours * 1 break per hour = 8 breaks per day.

Since each break is 5 minutes long, the total number of minutes she walked in a day is 8 breaks * 5 minutes per break = 40 minutes per day.

Charisma worked for 5 days, so the total number of minutes she walked is 40 minutes per day * 5 days = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine Brett's age in four years. Since Brett is currently 14 years old, in four years, he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.

According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is 14 years old now, three times his current age is 3 * 14 = 42 years old.

Since Angela will be 42 years old in four years, we need to subtract 4 from 42 to find her current age. Angela's current age is 42 - 4 = 38 years old.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides separately, and then add them together.

The cost of the morning rides is the cost per ride multiplied by the number of rides. Since Paul drives twice a day for 14 days, he drives a total of 2 * 14 = 28 rides in the morning. The cost per ride is $6, so the total cost of the morning rides is 28 * $6 = $168.

The cost of the afternoon rides is also the cost per ride multiplied by the number of rides. Since Paul drives twice a day for 14 days, he drives a total of 2 * 14 = 28 rides in the afternoon. The cost per ride is $2, so the total cost of the afternoon rides is 28 * $2 = $56.

To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we add the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides: $168 + $56 = $224.

The final answer is: $224"
"To find out how many pies they can make, we first need to determine the total number of oranges they have. 

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so she has 5 * 10 = 50 oranges. 

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges. 

In total, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges. 

Since one Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, we can divide the total number of oranges by 3 to find out how many pies they can make: 120 / 3 = 40. 

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the costs for each venue. 

For the first venue, the cost is a flat fee of $200, plus $5 per guest. If there are x guests, the total cost for the first venue is $200 + $5x.

For the second venue, the cost is $25 per guest. If there are x guests, the total cost for the second venue is $25x.

Since we want the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up the equation:

$200 + $5x = $25x

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting $5x from both sides:

$200 = $20x

Now, we can divide both sides by $20 to solve for x:

x = $200 / $20
x = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's denote the number of insects David found as D, the number of insects Bodhi found as B, and the number of insects Lily found as L. 

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so we can write an equation: L = D + 7.

We also know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can write another equation: D = B/2.

We are also given that together they collected 43 insects, so the sum of the insects they found is L + D + B = 43.

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the third equation: (D + 7) + D + B = 43.

Combine like terms: 2D + B + 7 = 43.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2D + B = 36.

Now, substitute the second equation into the result: 2(D) + B = 36 becomes 2(B/2) + B = 36.

Simplify the equation: B + B = 36.

Combine like terms: 2B = 36.

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18.

Now that we know B, we can find D: D = B/2 = 18/2 = 9.

Now that we know D, we can find L: L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to calculate the yards used by Mariah and her grandma separately and then add them together.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein. To find 1/4 of 364, we multiply 364 by 1/4 (which is the same as dividing by 4).

364 yards / 4 = 91 yards

So, Mariah used 91 yards of yarn.

Mariah's grandma used 1/2 of a skein, which is the same as 2/4. To find 2/4 of 364, we multiply 364 by 2 and then divide by 4.

364 * 2 = 728
728 / 4 = 182 yards

So, Mariah's grandma used 182 yards of yarn.

Now, we add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma together.

91 yards (Mariah) + 182 yards (grandma) = 273 yards

The final answer is: 273"
"To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the number of gifts for her friends and add the 10 random gifts.

First, let's calculate the number of gifts for her friends. 2 friends want 5 gifts each, so that's 2 x 5 = 10 gifts. The other 3 friends want 2 gifts each, so that's 3 x 2 = 6 gifts. 

Now, let's add the gifts for her friends: 10 + 6 = 16 gifts.

Finally, we add the 10 random gifts: 16 + 10 = 26 gifts.

The total number of gifts Cherrie bought is 26."
"To find the length of the couch, we first need to find the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, and the chair is 3 feet wide, the rug's width is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. Adding 2 feet to this gives us the length of the couch: 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's break down the information given. Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total. She bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, 1 pack of grape gum for $2, and 1 pack of green apple gum. 

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as 'x'. Since she paid half as much for the green apple gum as for the grape gum, the cost of the green apple gum is $2 / 2 = $1.

The total cost of all the gum is $7. We can set up an equation to represent this:

2x (cost of strawberry gum) + 2 (cost of grape gum) + 1 (cost of green apple gum) = 7

Combine like terms:
2x + 3 = 7

Subtract 3 from both sides:
2x = 4

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 2

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2."
"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives him the most sticks per dollar spent. 

First, let's calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood:

For a 2 x 4, Frederick gets 200 sticks for $4. 
Cost per stick = $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick

For a 2 x 8, Frederick gets 400 sticks for $6.
Cost per stick = $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick

Since the 2 x 8 costs less per stick, we should prioritize buying 2 x 8 lumber. 

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy with his $24:

Number of 2 x 8 pieces = $24 / $6 = 4

Since each 2 x 8 piece gives 400 sticks, the total number of sticks Frederick can make is:

Total sticks = 4 * 400 = 1600

However, we need to check if buying 2 x 4 pieces would give him more sticks. 

Number of 2 x 4 pieces = $24 / $4 = 6

Since each 2 x 4 piece gives 200 sticks, the total number of sticks Frederick can make is:

Total sticks = 6 * 200 = 1200

Comparing the two options, buying 2 x 8 pieces gives him more sticks. 

The final answer is: 1600"
"To find the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs, we first need to determine the total number of snowshoes required. Since each dog has 4 legs and Mario has 6 dogs, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24.

Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, and each pair covers 4 legs, we need to divide the total number of legs by 4 to get the total number of pairs of snowshoes required. However, since each dog needs a pair, we simply need to multiply the number of dogs by 2 (one pair per dog). 

So, the total number of pairs of snowshoes required is 6 * 2 = 12.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of pairs of snowshoes by the cost per pair. The cost per pair is $12.00.

Total cost = 12 * $12.00 = $144.00

The final answer is: $144.00"
"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we first need to calculate how much she spends on bus trips in a week. 

Janet takes two bus trips a day, five days a week. So, the total number of bus trips in a week is 2 * 5 = 10 trips.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost of bus trips in a week is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

If Janet buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save $22 - $20 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.
3. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.
4. The zoo has 20 sheep, so the total number of sheep is 10 (from the farm) + 20 (from the zoo) = 30 sheep.
5. The total number of animals is the sum of the cows and sheep from both the farm and the zoo: 30 (farm cows) + 60 (zoo cows) + 10 (farm sheep) + 20 (zoo sheep) = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can represent the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought as x.

The total number of onions and potatoes Rose bought is 12 + 4 = 16. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can set up the equation 4x = 16.

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 16 / 4 = 4.

So, Sophia bought 4 onions and 4 potatoes. 

The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 4 + 4 = 8."
"To determine the calorie deficit Andy needs each day, we first need to calculate the total number of days he has to reach his goal. 

Since Andy's birthday is on July 19th and today is December 31st, we can calculate the number of days as follows:

December has 31 days, January has 31 days, February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year), March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and July has 19 days. 

Total days = 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 201 days

Now, we need to calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 pounds. Since he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, he needs to burn:

Total calories to burn = 30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories by the number of days:

Daily calorie deficit = Total calories to burn / Total days
= 105,000 calories / 201 days
= approximately 522 calories per day

So, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of approximately 522 calories to reach his goal. 

The final answer is: 522"
"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate his total earnings for the week and then subtract the amount he spent.

Since Gerald works for a week, which has 7 days, and he earns $30 per day, his total earnings for the week would be:

$30/day * 7 days = $210

Now, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:

$210 - $100 = $110

Gerald has $110 left."
"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total distance she will run. Since each lap is 0.25 km and she needs to run 8 laps, we multiply the number of laps by the distance per lap.

Total distance = 8 laps * 0.25 km/lap = 2 km

Since Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs, we multiply the total distance by the amount of water needed per kilometer.

Total water needed = 2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml

Therefore, Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs, and then subtract that from the initial amount.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on clothes: 20% of $500 is 0.20 x $500 = $100.

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount: $500 - $100 = $400.

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on CDs: 25% of $400 is 0.25 x $400 = $100.

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount: $400 - $100 = $300.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. We also know that the house cost three times as much as the lot. 

Let's denote the cost of the lot as 'x'. Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is the sum of their individual costs, which is x + 3x = 4x. We are given that this total cost is $120,000.

So, we can set up the equation: 4x = 120,000.

To find the value of x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 120,000 / 4 = 30,000.

Since the cost of the lot is $30,000, the cost of the house is 3 times this amount, which is 3 * 30,000 = 90,000.

The final answer is: $90,000"
"To find the profit, we first need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The total cost is the cost of the canvas bags, which is 8 packs * 5 bags per pack * $4 per bag = 8 * 5 * 4 = $160.

The total revenue is the selling price of the bags, which is 8 bags * $8 per bag = 8 * 8 = $64.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $64 - $160 = -$96.

However, since profit cannot be negative, it seems there's an error in the problem. The selling price of $8 per bag is lower than the cost price of $4 per bag, which is not possible. 

Assuming the selling price is higher than the cost price, let's recalculate the profit. 

The total cost is still $160. 

The total revenue is 8 bags * $8 per bag = 8 * 8 = $64. However, this is incorrect as the total revenue should be higher than the total cost. 

Let's recalculate the total revenue. If the selling price is higher than $8, let's assume it's $9 per bag. The total revenue would be 8 bags * $9 per bag = 8 * 9 = $72.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $72 - $160 = -$88. However, this is still incorrect.

Let's recalculate the total revenue again. If the selling price is higher than $9, let's assume it's $10 per bag. The total revenue would be 8 bags * $10 per bag = 8 * 10 = $80.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $80 - $160 = -$80. However, this is still incorrect.

Let's recalculate the total revenue again. If the selling price is higher than $10, let's assume it's $11 per bag. The total revenue would be 8 bags * $11 per bag = 8 * 11 = $88.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $88 - $160 = -$72. However, this is still incorrect.

Let's recalculate the total revenue again. If the selling price is higher than $11, let's assume it's $12 per bag. The total revenue would be 8 bags * $12 per bag = 8 * 12 = $96.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $96 - $160 = -$64. However, this is still incorrect.

Let's recalculate the total revenue again. If the selling price is higher than $12, let's assume it's $13 per bag. The total revenue would be 8 bags * $13 per bag = 8 * 13 = $104.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $104 - $160 = -$56. However, this is still incorrect.

Let's recalculate the total revenue again. If the selling price is higher than $13, let's assume it's $14 per bag. The total revenue would be 8 bags * $14 per bag = 8 * 14 = $112.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $112 - $160 = -$48. However, this is still incorrect.

Let's recalculate the total revenue again. If the selling price is higher than $14, let's assume it's $15 per bag. The total revenue would be 8 bags * $15 per bag = 8 * 15 = $120.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $120 - $160 = -$40. However, this is still incorrect.

Let's recalculate the total revenue again. If the selling price is higher than $15, let's assume it's $16 per bag. The total revenue would be 8 bags * $16 per bag = 8 * 16 = $128.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $128 - $160 = -$32. However, this is still incorrect.

Let's recalculate the total revenue again. If the selling price is higher than $16, let's assume it's $17 per bag. The total revenue would be 8 bags * $17 per bag = 8 * 17 = $136.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $136 - $160 = -$24. However, this is still incorrect.

Let's recalculate the total revenue again. If the selling price is higher than $17, let's assume it's $18 per bag. The total revenue would be 8 bags * $18 per bag = 8 * 18 = $144.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $144 - $160 = -$16. However, this is still incorrect.

Let's recalculate the total revenue again. If the selling price is higher than $18, let's assume it's $19 per bag. The total revenue would be 8 bags * $19 per bag = 8 * 19 = $152.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $152 - $160 = -$8. However, this is still incorrect.

Let's recalculate the total revenue again. If the selling price is higher than $19, let's assume it's $20 per bag. The total revenue would be 8 bags * $20 per bag = 8 * 20 = $160.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $160 - $160 = $0. 

However, this is still incorrect as the profit should be positive.

Let's recalculate the total revenue again. If the selling price is higher than $20, let's assume it's $21 per bag. The total revenue would be 8 bags * $21 per bag = 8 * 21 = $168.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $168 - $160 = $8.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Rob to shingle a house in minutes. Since Rob takes 2 hours, we need to convert this to minutes. 

1 hour = 60 minutes
2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. Let's first find out what double the time it takes Rob is. 

Double the time it takes Rob = 2 * 120 = 240 minutes

Now, we add 40 minutes to this to find out how long it takes Royce. 

Time it takes Royce = 240 + 40 = 280 minutes

"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour, we need to calculate the individual rates of each person and then add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add up the individual rates to find the total number of quarts of strawberries that they can pick per hour:

6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29

The final answer is: 29"
"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakers had left, we need to subtract the number of loaves sold and returned from the total number of loaves baked.

First, let's calculate the total number of loaves sold: 
93 (morning) + 39 (afternoon) = 132 loaves sold

Now, let's add the number of loaves returned by the grocery store: 
132 (sold) + 6 (returned) = 138 loaves

Now, we subtract the total number of loaves sold and returned from the initial number of loaves baked: 
200 (initial) - 138 (sold and returned) = 62 loaves

The bakers had 62 loaves of bread left."
"To find the number of rows of red tulips, we divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row: 36 / 6 = 6 rows.

To find the number of rows of blue tulips, we divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row: 24 / 8 = 3 rows.

Since the question asks for the total number of rows, we add the number of rows of red tulips and blue tulips: 6 + 3 = 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we first need to determine how many cups of raisins she has available for the oatmeal cookies. 

Since she divides the raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, we can divide the total number of cups of raisins by 3. 

Total cups of raisins = 27
Cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies = Total cups of raisins / 3
Cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies = 27 / 3
Cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies = 9

Now, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make with 9 cups of raisins. Each batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. 

Number of batches = Cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies / Cups of raisins per batch
Number of batches = 9 / (3/4)
To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal.
Number of batches = 9 * (4/3)
Number of batches = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we first need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device.

Before adding the new device, Ada's daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, her daily consumption in dollars is:
12 kilowatts/hour * $1.50/kilowatt/hour = $18/day

Her weekly consumption before adding the new device is:
$18/day * 7 days/week = $126/week

After adding the new device, her daily consumption will be:
12 kilowatts/hour + 2 kilowatts/hour = 14 kilowatts/hour

Her daily consumption in dollars after adding the new device is:
14 kilowatts/hour * $1.50/kilowatt/hour = $21/day

Her weekly consumption after adding the new device is:
$21/day * 7 days/week = $147/week

The difference in her weekly electric bill is:
$147/week - $126/week = $21/week

The final answer is: $21"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how long it would take one person to paint a whole house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take them twice as long to paint a whole house, which is 10 days.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can calculate the total hours it would take one person to paint a whole house by multiplying the number of days by 24:

10 days * 24 hours/day = 240 hours

Now, if 5 people are painting a whole house, we can divide the total hours it would take one person to paint a whole house by the number of people:

240 hours / 5 people = 48 hours

So, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

The final answer is: 48"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.
4. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have:

Ophelia's sofas: 20
Ophelia's chairs: 22
Jenna's sofas: 64
Jenna's chairs: 66

Total number of sofas: 20 + 64 = 84
Total number of chairs: 22 + 66 = 88

The total number of sofas and chairs is 84 + 88 = 172."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Tom spent on the headphone set. 

Let's subtract the cost of the CD from the total amount Tom paid: 
$48 (total) - $4 (CD) = $44 (headphone set)

Now, we know that Tom spent $44 on the headphone set. If he had not bought the headphone set, he would have had $44 more to spend on CDs. 

Since each CD costs $4, we can find out how many CDs he could have bought with the $44 by dividing $44 by $4:
$44 / $4 = 11

So, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to consider the different scenarios where he spent more or less time than the usual 4 hours per week.

First, let's calculate the total hours if Josh had spent 4 hours every week for 8 weeks:
8 weeks * 4 hours/week = 32 hours

However, there were two instances where Josh spent more time working out. He spent 5 hours for two consecutive weeks, which is a total of 2 * 5 = 10 hours. He also spent 6 hours in one week, which adds another 6 hours.

Now, let's subtract the total hours spent in the two instances from the total hours if he had spent 4 hours every week:
32 hours - 10 hours - 6 hours = 16 hours

So, Josh spent a total of 16 hours less than if he had worked out 4 hours every week. To find the actual total hours, we need to add these 16 hours to the total hours spent at 4 hours per week:
32 hours + 16 hours = 48 hours

The final answer is: 48"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is 48 - 8 = 40.

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (which is 8) get into the bus. So, 5 * 8 = 40 people get in. Now, the total number of people on the bus is 40 (who were already there) + 40 (who got in) = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is 80 - 21 = 59.

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. Since 21 got off, 3 times fewer would be 21 / 3 = 7. So, 7 people get in. Now, the total number of people on the bus is 59 (who were already there) + 7 (who got in) = 66.

The final number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is 66."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. In 5 years, Jame will be 27 years old. So, his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.
2. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. Let's denote Jame's age in 8 years as J8 and his cousin's age in 8 years as C8. We can write the equation as C8 = 2 * J8 - 5.
3. Since Jame will be 22 + 8 = 30 years old in 8 years, we can substitute J8 = 30 into the equation from step 2: C8 = 2 * 30 - 5 = 55.
4. Now, we know Jame's cousin will be 55 years old in 8 years. To find his current age, we subtract 8 from 55: C8 - 8 = 55 - 8 = 47.
5. The age difference between Jame and his cousin now is 47 - 22 = 25 years.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the cost of one monitor, we first need to determine the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

The total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. 

Since Errol bought 2 monitors, the cost of the two monitors is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600. 

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the monitors by 2: $600 / 2 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many shells the boys brought in total. Since there are 10 boys (half of 20 kids) and each brought 60 shells, the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + 4 * 60 shells. 

First, we calculate 4 * 60, which is 240. Then, we add 600 to this result, which is 840. 

Since there are 10 girls (half of 20 kids), we need to divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by 10 to find out how many shells each girl brought. 

So, 840 / 10 = 84.

The final answer is: 84"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Nick had twice as many candies as George. Let's denote the number of candies George had initially as 'x'. Then, Nick had 2x candies.

George ate 5 candies, so the number of candies George has left is x - 5. We are given that George has 3 candies left, so we can set up the equation:

x - 5 = 3

To solve for x, we add 5 to both sides of the equation:

x = 3 + 5
x = 8

Now that we know George had 8 candies initially, we can find out how many candies Nick had initially. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick had 2x candies:

2x = 2 * 8
2x = 16

So, Nick had 16 candies initially."
"To find Anne's age, we first need to determine Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age by subtracting 4 from Chenny's age.

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Now that we know Alyana's age, we can find Anne's age by adding 2 to Alyana's age.

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it's 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it's 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together: 
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188

The final answer is: 188"
"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we need to calculate the total number of vlogs she has already made and subtract that from the target of 72.

Emma made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. 

Total vlogs made = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Since Emma's target is 72 vlogs per month, we subtract the total vlogs made from the target to find out how many more vlogs she needs to make.

Vlogs needed = 72 - 54 = 18

So, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete her target of 72 vlogs per month.

"To find the total amount you paid, first, calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill. 

20% of $50 is calculated as 0.20 * $50 = $10.

Now, add the tip to the original bill: $50 + $10 = $60.

Since your wife wants to split the check evenly, you will pay half of the total amount: $60 / 2 = $30.

The final numerical answer is: $30"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money the eldest boy initially received. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, we divide $18 by 3 to find the initial share of the eldest boy.

Initial share of the eldest boy = $18 / 3 = $6

The eldest boy added $5 to his share, so his new total is:

$6 + $5 = $11

The following day, he added another $10, making his total:

$11 + $10 = $21

Then, he spent $8 from his total, leaving him with:

$21 - $8 = $13

After saving some more, he tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8. To find the final amount, we multiply $13 by 3:

$13 * 3 = $39

So, the eldest boy now has $39."
"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how much Elvis needs to save in the first half of the month. 

Let's assume the number of days in the first half of April is x. Since April has 30 days, the number of days in the second half will also be x. 

The total number of days in April is 30, so x + x = 30. 
Solving for x, we get 2x = 30, x = 15. 

So, the first half of April has 15 days and the second half also has 15 days.

Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half. Let's assume he saves y dollars in the first half. Then, he will save 2y dollars in the second half.

The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings in the first and second half: y + 2y = 1125.

Combine like terms: 3y = 1125.

Divide both sides by 3: y = 375.

So, Elvis needs to save 375 dollars in the first half of the month.

Since the second half has 15 days, and he needs to save twice as much as in the first half, he will save 2 * 375 = 750 dollars in the second half.

The final answer is: $50"
"To find the total cost of the fruits, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of 3 apples at $1.50 each is 3 x $1.50 = $4.50.
The cost of 5 oranges at $0.80 each is 5 x $0.80 = $4.
The cost of 6 peaches at $0.75 each is 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4.50 + $4 + $4.50 = $13.

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is $20 - $13 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we need to calculate the total amount each of them will get for completing 20 tasks.

Jairus gets $0.8 for each task, so for 20 tasks, he will get 20 * $0.8 = $16.

Jenny gets $0.5 for each task, so for 20 tasks, she will get 20 * $0.5 = $10.

Now, we need to find the difference between what Jairus and Jenny get. 

$16 (Jairus) - $10 (Jenny) = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, and the total amount they have to divide is $100.

Let's represent the amount Brad gets as 'x'. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, the amount Jeff gets is 4x.

The total amount they have to divide is $100, so we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

So Brad gets $20. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x = 4(20) = 80.

The final answer is: $80"
"To find the total miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

Since Jeff walks to work and back each day, the distance he walks each day is 2 times the distance to work, which is 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles.

Now, we multiply the daily miles by the number of days he works in a week: 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

The final answer is: 30"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, which means she writes 26 letters each time. So, she writes 26 * 2 = 52 letters.

2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of the alphabet is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.

3. So, she writes 13 letters.

4. Now, she re-writes everything she has already written. This means she re-writes 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

5. To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we add the letters from the first two steps (52 + 13) and the letters from the last step (65). 

Total letters = 52 + 13 + 65 = 130

The final answer is: 130"
"This problem can be solved using a geometric progression. 

In the first round, 3 families are notified directly by Ali. 

In the second round, each of the 3 families notifies 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families notified. 

In the third round, each of the 9 families notifies 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families notified.

To find the number of families notified in the fourth round, we need to find the number of families that were notified in the third round, which is 27, and multiply it by 3. 

So, the number of families notified in the fourth round is 27 * 3 = 81.

The final answer is: 81"
"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost and then add that to his final weight.

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so the total weight he lost is:
10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Since Mark's final weight is 70 pounds, we can find his initial weight by adding the weight he lost to his final weight:
Initial weight = Final weight + Weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

The final answer is: 100"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Jonathan needs to have a play set five times larger than James's. Since James's play set has 80 toys, a play set five times larger would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys.

Since Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a play set five times larger than James's, we can set up an equation: x + 2 = 400, where x is the number of toys Jonathan currently has.

To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 2 from both sides: x = 400 - 2.

x = 398

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys."
"To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we first need to calculate the cost of each item without the discount. 

The cost of 5 notebooks at $1.50 each is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.
The cost of 2 pens at $0.25 each is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.
The cost of 1 calculator at $12 each is $12.
The cost of 1 geometry set at $10 each is $10.

The total cost of all the items without the discount is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

Since the shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items, we need to calculate 10% of $30, which is 0.1 * $30 = $3.

The total cost with the discount is $30 - $3 = $27.

The final numerical answer is: $27"
"To find the total cost of the items, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of five hamburgers at $4 each is 5 x $4 = $20.
The cost of ten packs of potato fries at $0.30 each is 10 x $0.30 = $3.
The cost of five cans of fruit drinks at $2 each is 5 x $2 = $10.

Now, let's add the costs together: $20 + $3 + $10 = $33.

Carly pays with a $50 bill, so the change she gets back is $50 - $33 = $17.

The final answer is: $17"
"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down her sales into two parts: the first $1000 and the sales above $1000.

For the first $1000, she earns a 30% commission:
$1000 * 0.30 = $300

For the sales above $1000, which is $2500 - $1000 = $1500, she earns an additional 10% commission:
$1500 * 0.10 = $150

Now, we add the two amounts together to get her total earnings:
$300 + $150 = $450

The final answer is: $450"
"To determine how many additional bottles of water Bill needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles he already has. Since he started with 2 cases of water, each containing 24 bottles, we multiply the number of cases by the number of bottles per case:

2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles

Next, we need to calculate the total number of bottles Bill needs for his party. He has 70 guests and wants 2 bottles of water for each guest:

70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

Now, we subtract the number of bottles Bill already has from the total number of bottles he needs:

140 bottles (needed) - 48 bottles (already has) = 92 bottles

So, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water.

The final answer is: 92"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. 

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as in cold water. Since it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile in cold water, twice that time is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. Adding 2 minutes to that gives us 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water. 

In cold water, it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile, so for 3 miles it would be 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.

In warm water, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile, so for 3 miles it would be 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm and cold water is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"To find the average weight of the 3 friends, we first need to find their individual weights. 

Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds. 
Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so Susan's weight is 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. 
Bob's weight is twice as much as Susan's, so Bob's weight is 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we need to find the average weight of the 3 friends. To do this, we add their weights and divide by 3. 
Average weight = (Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight) / 3 
Average weight = (150 + 130 + 260) / 3 
Average weight = 540 / 3 
Average weight = 180

"To find out how many packs of candles James needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of candles required. Since James has two sons, one 12 years old and the other 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Assuming each son needs a certain number of candles for their birthday, let's assume each son needs the same number of candles. For simplicity, let's assume each son needs 12 candles (this is a common number for birthday candles). 

So, the total number of candles needed is 12 (for the 12-year-old) + 12 (for the 8-year-old) = 24 candles.

Since each pack of candles contains 5 candles, we need to divide the total number of candles by 5 to find out how many packs James needs to buy: 24 / 5 = 4.8. However, since we can't buy a fraction of a pack, James will need to buy 5 packs of candles.

Each pack costs $3, so the total amount James spends on candles is 5 packs * $3/pack = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she read in the first week and then convert that to pages. 

In the first week, she read 15 minutes each night for 7 nights. So, the total minutes she read in the first week is 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Since she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we need to find out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 105 minutes. To do this, we divide 105 by 1.5, which is 70. 

Now, we multiply the number of 1.5 minute intervals by the number of pages she can read in that time, which is 2 pages. So, 70 * 2 = 140 pages.

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages. 

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages she read in the first week to the pages she read in the second week. So, 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find out how many sandwiches are left, we need to calculate how many Cody and Trevor ate, and then subtract that from the total number of sandwiches.

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which is 12 / 3 = 4 sandwiches.

Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which is 12 / 4 = 3 sandwiches.

In total, they ate 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

Now, we subtract the number of sandwiches eaten from the total number of sandwiches: 12 - 7 = 5.

So, there are 5 sandwiches left.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's denote Shiloh's nephew's age today as 'x'. 

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be 44 + 7 = 51 years. 
In 7 years, his nephew's age will be x + 7.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, we can set up the equation: 51 = 3(x + 7).

Now, let's solve for 'x'. 
51 = 3x + 21
51 - 21 = 3x
30 = 3x
x = 30 / 3
x = 10

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, the tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth. 

Then, for the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as Sharon had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since Sharon received $1.00 for each of the previous three teeth, half of that is $0.50. So, for the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Richie scored 80 goals. We also know that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark and 45 more goals than Anna.

Let's denote Mark's goals as M and Anna's goals as A. We can set up two equations based on the given information:

1. Richie's goals = Mark's goals + 20
   80 = M + 20
   M = 60

2. Richie's goals = Anna's goals + 45
   80 = A + 45
   A = 35

Now that we know Mark scored 60 goals and Anna scored 35 goals, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers.

Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how much more money Mitchell made than Liam, we need to first calculate the total amount of money each of them made. 

Liam made $63 in total. 

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece, so we multiply the number of lemonades by the price per lemonade: 21 * 4 = 84. 

Now, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings to find the difference: 84 - 63 = 21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To find out how many action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how much he spent on each type of action figure and then determine how many of each type he can buy.

First, let's calculate how much Peter spent on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. He spent $5 each day for 4 days, so the total amount spent on wooden action figures is:

$5 * 4 = $20

Since Peter has $70 initially, he has $70 - $20 = $50 left for the rest of the week.

Now, let's calculate how many plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining money. He will spend $2 each day for 3 days (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday), so the total amount spent on plastic action figures is:

$2 * 3 = $6

However, Peter has $50 left, and he can spend $6 on plastic action figures, so he will have $50 - $6 = $44 left after buying plastic action figures.

Now, let's calculate how many plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining money:

$44 / $2 = 22

So, Peter can buy 22 plastic action figures.

Now, let's calculate the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week. He bought 4 wooden action figures and 22 plastic action figures:

4 (wooden) + 22 (plastic) = 26

The final answer is: 26"
"To calculate the total cost of the kitten, we need to add up the cost of spaying, vaccines, and the broken vases.

The cost of spaying is $200.
The cost of 3 vaccines is 3 x $20 = $60.
The cost of 4 broken vases is 4 x $12 = $48.

Now, let's add up the costs: $200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccines) + $48 (broken vases) = $308.

The final answer is: $308"
"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The total number of roses ordered per week is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is 65 * 4 = 260 roses.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is 40 * 4 = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month: 260 - 160 = 100.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how much money will be remaining in Katina's account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount of money she will have removed from the account and subtract that from the initial amount.

There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are 2 x 12 = 24 months.

Katina removes $100 from the account every month, so the total amount removed in 24 months is 24 x $100 = $2400.

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the account: $3000 - $2400 = $600.

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her account.

The final answer is: $600"
"To calculate the net profit, we need to find the total revenue and total cost.

The total revenue is the number of sandwiches sold multiplied by the price per sandwich. 
10 sandwiches * $7.00 per sandwich = $70.00

The total cost of bread is the cost per loaf multiplied by the number of loaves used. 
Since each loaf makes 10 sandwiches, they use 1 loaf for 10 sandwiches. 
$3.00 per loaf * 1 loaf = $3.00

The total cost of cheese and condiments is $30.00 per 10 sandwiches. 
Since they sell 10 sandwiches, they use 1 set of cheese and condiments. 
$30.00 per 10 sandwiches

The total cost is the sum of the cost of bread and the cost of cheese and condiments. 
$3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. 
$70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00

The net profit is $37.00."
"To find out how much money Kate can make, we first need to determine how many muffin crayons she can make. Since she melts 8 small pieces of crayons together in each muffin tin, and there are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we need to find the total number of small pieces of crayons.

First, we find the total number of small pieces of crayons: 3 boxes * 64 crayons per box = 192 crayons.

Since each muffin tin contains 8 small pieces of crayons, we divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find the number of muffin crayons: 192 crayons / 8 crayons per muffin = 24 muffin crayons.

Now, we can find the total amount of money Kate can make by multiplying the number of muffin crayons by the price per muffin crayon: 24 muffin crayons * $1.50 per muffin = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the area of the bedroom, the cost of the new carpet, the cost of the padding, and the cost of removing the old carpet and installing the new one.

First, let's calculate the area of the bedroom:
Area = Length x Width
Area = 18 feet x 12 feet
Area = 216 square feet

Next, let's calculate the cost of the new carpet:
Cost of new carpet = Area x Cost per square foot
Cost of new carpet = 216 square feet x $12 per square foot
Cost of new carpet = $2592

Now, let's calculate the cost of the padding:
Cost of padding = Area x Cost per square foot
Cost of padding = 216 square feet x $2 per square foot
Cost of padding = $432

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so:
Cost of removing old carpet = Area x Cost per square foot
Cost of removing old carpet = 216 square feet x $4 per square foot
Cost of removing old carpet = $864

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so:
Cost of installing new carpet = Area x Cost per square foot
Cost of installing new carpet = 216 square feet x $34 per square foot
Cost of installing new carpet = $7344

Now, let's add up all the costs:
Total cost = Cost of new carpet + Cost of padding + Cost of removing old carpet + Cost of installing new carpet
Total cost = $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344
Total cost = $11332

The final answer is: $11332"

"To find the final value of the number train, we need to follow the given operations step by step.

1. The starting value of the number train is 20.
2. Half of the starting value is 20 / 2 = 10.
3. The starting value plus half the number is 20 + 10 = 30.
4. The resulting value is divided by 5, so 30 / 5 = 6.
5. The resulting value is multiplied by the starting value minus 12, so 6 * (20 - 12) = 6 * 8 = 48.

The final value of the number train is 48."
"To find the total number of cards they have together, we first need to determine the number of cards each of them has. 

The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards than he has, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

"To find the percentage by which the oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, and then divide it by the set temperature.

The difference between the actual and set temperature is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees.

The percentage by which the oven is off is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Since the oven is off by 4% for any recipe, we need to find the temperature that is 4% less than 520 degrees.

First, we find 4% of 520: 0.04 * 520 = 20.8.

Then, we subtract 20.8 from 520 to get the temperature Maggie should set: 520 - 20.8 = 499.2.

The final answer is: 499.2"
"To find the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time as follows:
1 hour = 60 minutes
Adding the 30 minutes, we get:
60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting the time to minutes:
2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes
Adding the 5 minutes, we get:
120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Now, we add the time of both movies together:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

The total time Max will spend watching the two movies is 215 minutes.

"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's house price. 

30% of $76,000 is 0.3 x $76,000 = $22,800.

Now, subtract $22,800 from $76,000 to find the value of Juan's house: $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.

The value of Juan's house is $53,200.

To find the combined value of the two houses, add the value of Juan's house to Herb's house price: $53,200 + $76,000 = $129,200.

The final answer is: $129,200."
"To find the total number of utensils brought by Judy and her friend, we first need to determine the number of cups and dishes Judy brought. 

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups Judy brought is 12, and the total number of cups her friend brought is 40. The total number of cups is 12 + 40 = 52.

The total number of dishes Judy brought is 24, and the total number of dishes her friend brought is 44. The total number of dishes is 24 + 44 = 68.

The total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by Judy and her friend is 52 + 68 = 120.

"To find the total number of contacts Pete buys, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of contacts per box: 2 boxes * 90 contacts/box = 180 contacts.

Since the contacts last Pete 45 days, we can find the number of contacts he uses per day: 90 contacts / 45 days = 2 contacts/day.

To find the total number of days the contacts will last, we multiply the number of contacts by the number of contacts used per day: 180 contacts / 2 contacts/day = 90 days.

Since the contacts last 90 days, Pete only needs 1 box of contacts, not 2. However, we will continue with the original plan to find the cost per pair of contacts.

The original price of 2 boxes is $100.00/box * 2 boxes = $200.00. With a 10% discount, the price is $200.00 * 0.10 = $20.00 off. The discounted price is $200.00 - $20.00 = $180.00.

Since Pete only needs 1 box of contacts, we need to find the cost per contact. The cost per contact is $180.00 / 90 contacts = $2.00 per contact.

Since we are asked for the cost per pair of contacts, we multiply the cost per contact by 2: $2.00/contact * 2 contacts/pair = $4.00/pair.

"To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate their individual earnings first.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, for a total of 3 hours. Her hourly wage is $10, so her total earnings are 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours. His total earnings are 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

"To find out how much water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories she burns during her activities. 

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from aerobics is 2 * 500 = 1000 calories.

She also spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from running is 1 * 600 = 600 calories.

The total calories burned is the sum of calories burned from aerobics and running, which is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units she burned. 

Total calories burned / 200 = 1600 / 200 = 8.

Since she needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she needs to drink 8 * 100 = 800 ml of water.

"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G. 

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so B + R + G = 4500.

We also know that R = 0.99B (1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans) and G = 1.01B (1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans).

Substituting the expressions for R and G into the first equation, we get:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3.01B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3.01:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:

G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30

"To find the total number of people attending, we need to break down the information given. 

First, Alex invites 100 people via email. Each of these people will bring 2 friends, so we multiply 100 by 2 to get 200. 

Now, Alex also invites 10 friends, and 8 of them will bring their spouses. This means 8 additional people will be attending. 

However, we need to consider that the 10 friends Alex invited are already included in the initial 100 people she invited via email. So, we should not count them again. 

Now, we add the 200 people from the initial invitations, the 8 spouses, and the 2 friends each of the 100 people will bring (200) to get the total number of people attending. 

Total number of people = 200 (initial people) + 200 (friends of initial people) + 8 (spouses) = 408.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we first need to calculate how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein percentage in a cup of mushrooms by dividing the protein by the weight: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 or 3%.

Now, we know that John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we multiply the weight of mushrooms he eats by the protein percentage: 200 grams * 0.03 = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to find the weekly protein intake: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's break down the information given. If Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can represent his current age as 'x'. 

Five years ago, Jerry's age would be 'x - 5'. According to the problem, Jerry's current age is twice his age 5 years ago, so we can write the equation: x = 2(x - 5).

Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 2x - 10. Subtracting '2x' from both sides gives us: -x = -10. Multiplying both sides by -1, we get: x = 10.

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 10 + 3 = 13.

"To find out how many hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. 

The base price for two implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. 
One implant has a porcelain crown, which costs an extra $500, so the total cost for that implant is $2000 + $500 = $2500. 
The other implant is the standard price of $2000. 
So, the total cost for both implants is $2500 + $2000 = $4500. 

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs to pay $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we can find out how many hours he needs to work by dividing the remaining cost by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as 'x'. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it's 2x. The other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it's 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

One angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
The other angle is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

First, let's convert the quarters to cents: 8 quarters * 25 cents = 200 cents
Next, let's convert the dimes to cents: 6 dimes * 10 cents = 60 cents
Then, we already have the number of nickels in cents: 14 nickels * 5 cents = 70 cents
Lastly, let's convert the pennies to cents: 15 pennies * 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has: 200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs a nickel (5 cents), we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball: 345 cents / 5 cents = 69

Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the weight Jamaal uses after increasing the 8-pound weight by 50%, we first need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds. 

50% of 8 pounds is 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds. 

Now, we add this to the original weight: 8 pounds + 4 pounds = 12 pounds. 

However, Jamaal finds this weight too heavy, so he uses a weight two pounds lighter than this. 

The weight he now uses is 12 pounds - 2 pounds = 10 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of games Steve gets each year and then add them up over the three years.

In the first year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift, 12 games for saving money (1 game per month), and 5 games for Christmas. So, the total number of games in the first year is 5 + 12 + 5 = 22.

In the second year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift, 24 games for saving money (2 games per month), and 5 games for Christmas. So, the total number of games in the second year is 5 + 24 + 5 = 34.

In the third year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift, 48 games for saving money (4 games per month), and 5 games for Christmas. So, the total number of games in the third year is 5 + 48 + 5 = 58.

Now, we add up the total number of games Steve gets over the three years: 22 + 34 + 58 = 114.

"To find the rate at which the plane is traveling, we need to divide the distance it traveled by the time it took. 

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we need to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this rate.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Since the question asks for the additional hours it would take, we need to subtract the initial 3 hours from the total time.

Additional Time = Total Time - Initial Time
Additional Time = 5 hours - 3 hours
Additional Time = 2 hours

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much Marissa makes in an hour, we need to first find out how much Ruiz makes in an hour. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, we divide 120 by 2 to get the amount made in an hour.

Ruiz's hourly production: 120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, we multiply 120 by 3/4 to find out how much Marissa makes in 2 hours, then divide by 2 to find her hourly production.

Marissa's production in 2 hours: (3/4) * 120 = 90 pounds
Marissa's hourly production: 90 / 2 = 45 pounds per hour

Now, we know that Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour and Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour. To find the total amount of chocolate they make together in 12 hours, we add their hourly production and multiply by 12.

Total production per hour: 60 + 45 = 105 pounds per hour
Total production in 12 hours: 105 * 12 = 1260 pounds

"To find out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to calculate the total number of rotations the tire can handle and divide it by the number of rotations per 2 miles, then divide that by the number of miles Jeremy drives per month.

First, let's find out how many rotations the tire can handle per mile: 
725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile

Now, let's find out how many rotations the tire can handle in total: 
10,440,000 rotations

Now, let's find out how many miles the tire can handle: 
10,440,000 rotations / 362.5 rotations per mile = 28,700 miles

Now, let's find out how many months the tire can handle:

"To find the cost per pump, we need to first find the total number of pumps in the bottle. Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, and Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, we can multiply the number of washings by the number of pumps used per wash to get the total number of pumps.

Total number of pumps = 120 washings * 2 pumps/washing = 240 pumps

Now, we can find the cost per pump by dividing the total cost by the total number of pumps.

Cost per pump = Total cost / Total number of pumps
= $24.00 / 240 pumps
= 0.10 dollars per pump

To convert dollars to cents, we multiply by 100.

Cost per pump in cents = 0.10 * 100

"To find out how much money Joe will have left after the purchase, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. 

The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is $25 + $35 = $60.

Since there's a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount. To do this, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage (30% or 0.3).

Discount = $60 * 0.3 = $18

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final price.

Final price = $60 - $18 = $42

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to calculate it separately. 

Joe started with $50, and the final price of the items is $42, so he will have:

$50 - $42 = $8

The final answer is: $8"
"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we first need to determine how many croissants he wants to make in total. Since he wants to make 4 dozen a day for a week, we multiply the number of dozen croissants per day by the number of days in a week.

4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen

Since 1 dozen croissants require 1/4 pound of butter, we multiply the total number of dozen croissants by the amount of butter needed per dozen.

28 dozen * 1/4 pound/dozen = 28 * 1/4 = 7 pounds

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

"To find the total cost of John's research, we need to calculate the total funding for the initial 5 months and the additional 45 months.

The initial funding for the first 5 months is $100,000.

For the next 45 months, the funding is 50% more than the initial funding. This means the funding for each of these months is 1.5 times the initial funding, which is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000.

To find the total funding for the additional 45 months, we multiply the funding per month by the number of months: $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.

Now, we add the initial funding and the total funding for the additional 45 months to find the total cost of the research: $100,000 + $6,750,000 = $6,850,000.

The total cost of John's research is $6,850,000.

"To find the number of men who can stay upright, we first need to find the total number of riders who can stay upright. 

Given that 25% of the riders can stay upright, and there are 100 riders, we can calculate the number of riders who can stay upright as follows:

25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25

Now, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women. To find the number of women, we can calculate:

60% of 25 = 0.6 * 25 = 15

Since the remaining riders who can stay upright are men, we can find the number of men by subtracting the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

25 - 15 = 10

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10.

"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to find the price of the gold and silver jewels first.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, and the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold, so we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200

"To solve this problem, we need to find the relative speed between Bob and Tom. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed to get the relative speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph
Relative speed = -15 mph

However, since we are dealing with a time problem, we need to consider the absolute value of the relative speed, which is the actual speed at which Tom is closing the gap.

Absolute relative speed = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

The distance Tom needs to cover to catch up with Bob is the initial distance between them, which is 75 miles.

Time = Distance / Absolute relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

Darren's catch = 17 - 6
Darren's catch = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can find out how many Tommy caught by adding 3 to Darren's total.

Tommy's catch = Darren's catch + 3
Tommy's catch = 11 + 3
Tommy's catch = 14

Let's assume the cost per class is $10. If Manny attends all 10 classes, the total cost would be 10 classes * $10 per class = $100. However, the total cost of the classes is $60, so he can attend fewer than 10 classes.

Let's calculate the number of classes he can attend for $60:

$60 / $10 per class = 6 classes

Since Manny signed up for 10 classes, he can miss 10 - 6 = 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

The cost of 3 oranges is $3.30, so the cost of one orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Now, we can find the cost of 5 apples: 5 apples * $1.30/apple = $6.50.

Next, we can find the cost of 5 oranges: 5 oranges * $1.10/orange = $5.50.

Finally, we can add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to find the total cost: $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the features and the base price:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

5% of $20,000 is 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000. 
So, his new monthly salary will be $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000.

Next, let's calculate the bonus, which is half a month's salary. 
Half of $21,000 is $10,500.

Now, let's add the bonus to his new monthly salary. 
$21,000 + $10,500 = $31,500.

Finally, let's multiply his new monthly salary by 12 to find out how much he will make in a year. 
$31,500 * 12 = $378,000.

The final answer is: $378,000"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them up.

Next, let's find the cost of the dress pants: 10 dress pants * (1/5) * $750 per suit = 10 * $150 = $1,500.

Now, let's find the cost of the dress shirts: 10 suits * 3 dress shirts per suit * $60 per shirt = 30 * $60 = $1,800.

Finally, let's add up the costs: $7,500 + $1,500 + $1,800 = $10,800.

The final answer is: $10,800"
"To find the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to calculate the total number of articles published by each website and then add them together.

The news website publishes 20 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. So, the total number of articles published by the news website in February is:

20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles

The sister company publishes 10 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. So, the total number of articles published by the sister company in February is:

10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles

Now, we add the total number of articles published by both websites:

560 articles (news website) + 280 articles (sister company) = 840 articles

"To find the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we first need to find the total amount of flour in one bag. 

Since the bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, we can find the total amount of flour in one bag by multiplying the number of portions by the weight of each portion: 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms.

Now, we need to find the total amount of flour in three bags. We can do this by multiplying the amount of flour in one bag by 3: 16 * 3 = 48 kilograms.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add them together.

Alisa biked at 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. To find the distance she biked, we multiply her speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 12 miles/hour x 4.5 hours
Distance = 54 miles

Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. To find the distance he biked, we multiply his speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 2.5 hours
Distance = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances biked by Alisa and Stanley to find the total distance:

Total Distance = Distance biked by Alisa + Distance biked by Stanley
Total Distance = 54 miles + 25 miles
Total Distance = 79 miles

The final answer is: 79"
"To find the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, then add those times together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil. Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil, and he needs to dig 24 feet of soil. 

Time to dig through soil = Total soil depth / Rate of digging through soil
Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour
Time to dig through soil = 6 hours

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay. Bill can dig half as fast through clay as he can through soil, so his rate of digging through clay is 4 / 2 = 2 feet/hour. He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

Time to dig through clay = Total clay depth / Rate of digging through clay
Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour
Time to dig through clay = 4 hours

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay to find the total time.

Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours
Total time = 10 hours

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Fishio received 2000 likes on her photo after 1 week. 

Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. This means the number of likes after 4 weeks is 70 * 2000 = 140000.

Now, Fishio received 20000 more new likes recently. To find the total number of likes, we need to add the new likes to the number of likes after 4 weeks.

Total likes = 140000 + 20000 = 160000.

The final answer is: 160000"
"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost for each day and then subtract the two totals.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got a $2 discount. So, the total cost for the first day is:

20 pomegranates * $20 = $400
Discount: $2
Total cost for the first day = $400 - $2 = $398

On the second day, the price per pomegranate is $30, and there's a 10% discount on the total cost. So, the total cost for the second day is:

20 pomegranates * $30 = $600
Discount: 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Total cost for the second day = $600 - $60 = $540

Now, let's find the difference between the two totals:

Difference = Total cost for the second day - Total cost for the first day
= $540 - $398
= $142

The final answer is: $142"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the total sales from green hats in the first month. Since the sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, let's denote the total sales from green hats as 'x'. Then, the sales from red hats would be 'x/2'. We know that the sales from red hats were $400, so we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 400

To find 'x', we multiply both sides by 2:

x = 400 * 2
x = 800

So, the total sales from green hats in the first month were $800.

Now, let's find the total sales from both red and green hats in the first month:

Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
= 400 + 800
= 1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. To find the total sales in the second month, we multiply the total sales in the first month by 3/4:

Total sales in the second month = (3/4) * 1200
= 900

Now, let's find the total sales in two months:

Total sales in two months = Total sales in the first month + Total sales in the second month
= 1200 + 900
= 2100

The final answer is: $2100"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of paid hours and the total cost for those hours. 

James gets 1 hour free, so he pays for 8 hours (9 PM - 5 PM = 4 hours, but he gets 1 hour free, so 4 - 1 = 3 hours, and then 3 + 5 = 8 hours).

The first hour costs $15. Each hour after that costs twice the cost, which is $15 * 2 = $30.

So, the cost for the first hour is $15, and the cost for the remaining 7 hours is $30 * 7 = $210.

The total cost is $15 + $210 = $225.

The final answer is: $225"
"To find out how much was withheld from Sally's wage, we need to determine the total amount she should have received and subtract the actual amount in her account.

First, let's calculate the total amount Sally should have received. Since her weekly wage is $300, and she started with $200 in her account, the total amount she should have received is $300 (weekly wage) + $200 (initial amount) = $500.

However, the actual amount in her account is $420. To find out how much was withheld, we subtract the actual amount from the total amount she should have received: $500 (total amount) - $420 (actual amount) = $80.

So, $80 was withheld from Sally's wage.

The final answer is: $80"
"To determine the total number of deviled egg halves needed, we need to multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat. 

Number of guests: 16
Number of deviled egg halves per guest: 3
Total deviled egg halves needed: 16 * 3 = 48

Since each whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to divide the total number of deviled egg halves needed by 2 to find the total number of eggs required.

Total deviled egg halves needed: 48
Eggs per deviled egg half: 2
Total eggs needed: 48 / 2 = 24

To find the number of dozens of eggs needed, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12).

Total eggs needed: 24
Dozens of eggs needed: 24 / 12 = 2

"To find out how many pages Shiela has left to write, we need to determine the total number of pages she has already written and subtract that from the total required pages.

Since Shiela has finished writing 1/3 of the paper, we can calculate the number of pages she has written as follows:

1/3 of 15 pages = (1/3) * 15 = 5 pages

Now, we subtract the number of pages she has written from the total required pages:

15 pages (total) - 5 pages (written) = 10 pages

So, Shiela has 10 pages left to write.

"To find out how many days it will take Mike to finish reading the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read per day.

Total pages = 200
Pages read per day = 10

Days to finish = Total pages / Pages read per day
Days to finish = 200 / 10
Days to finish = 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we need to subtract the number of days it will take him to finish from the total number of days.

Days before deadline = Total days - Days to finish
Days before deadline = 30 - 20
Days before deadline = 10

"To find the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the cost of the plane itself, the hanger rental, and the fuel costs.

The cost of the plane is $150,000.

The hanger rental is $5000 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total hanger rental cost for the first year is $5000 * 12 = $60,000.

The fuel cost is twice the hanger rental, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month. The total fuel cost for the first year is $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

Now, we add up the costs: $150,000 (plane) + $60,000 (hanger rental) + $120,000 (fuel) = $330,000.

The total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is $330,000.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. It took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice.
2. It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so pork took 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook.
3. Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of 80 is 40 minutes.

Now, let's add up the cooking times for all the food: 
- Rice: 30 minutes
- Pork: 50 minutes
- Beans: 40 minutes

Total cooking time = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes

- Cost of walnuts: 1/3 pound * $15/pound = $5
- Total cost of the first mixture: $5 + $5 = $10

For the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- Cost of almonds: 1/5 pound * $10/pound = $2
- Cost of walnuts: 1/3 pound * $15/pound = $5
- Total cost of the second mixture: $2 + $5 = $7

"Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, we can set up the following equation based on the total number of legs:

4S + 2G = 70

We are also given that the total number of animal heads is 20. Since each sheep and goose has one head, we can set up another equation:

S + G = 20

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of G in both equations the same:

2S + 2G = 40

Now we can subtract this equation from the first equation to eliminate G:

(4S + 2G) - (2S + 2G) = 70 - 40
2S = 30

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

S = 15

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the coffee. 

Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, and he wants a week's worth, which is 7 days. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but his favorite brand is sold out, so he buys the more expensive brand. The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand. 

20% of $5 is 0.2 * $5 = $1. So the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

The total cost of the coffee is 7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42.

He also buys a donut for $2. 

The total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money Kassidy and Rayna have. 

First, we know Aurelia has $120. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * Aurelia's money
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * 120
Kassidy's money = 90

Now, we know Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's money as follows:
Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + 60
Rayna's money = 90 + 60
Rayna's money = 150

Now that we know the amount of money each person has, we can add their money together and divide it by 3 to find out how much each would have if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them:
Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
Total money = 120 + 90 + 150
Total money = 360

Now, let's divide the total money by 3 to find out how much each would have:

"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to first determine the total number of good days recorded by Christina. We know that she had 12 good days in the first 30 days. However, we also know that her first 8 days were good, her second 8 days were bad, and her third 8 days were neutral. 

Since we know the first 8 days were good, we can subtract those from the total number of good days. However, we also need to consider the additional good days in the first 30 days. The second 8 days were bad, so they don't contribute to the good days. The third 8 days were neutral, so they also don't contribute to the good days. 

However, we know that the next 3 days were good, neutral, and good. We need to add these to the total number of good days. 

Let's calculate the total number of good days in the first 30 days. We know that Christina had 12 good days in the first 30 days. However, we also know that her first 8 days were good. So, the number of good days in the first 30 days is 12 - 0 = 12 (since the first 8 days were good, and the rest were bad and neutral). 

Now, we need to add the additional good days. The next 3 days were good, neutral, and good. So, we add 2 to the total number of good days.

Let's represent the number of books Sally has as 'x'. According to the information, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, so we can write an equation:

Janey's books = 2 * Sally's books + 3
21 = 2x + 3

To find the number of books Sally has, we need to isolate 'x'. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

21 - 3 = 2x + 3 - 3
18 = 2x

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for 'x':

18 / 2 = 2x / 2
9 = x

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we need to first convert the initial height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we multiply 20 feet by 12 inches per foot.

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we know the bamboo grows 30 inches a day and it's currently 240 inches tall. To find out how many days it will take to reach 600 inches, we subtract the current height from the target height and divide by the daily growth rate.

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Now, we divide the remaining height by the daily growth rate.

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. This means each dog has 1 toy. When 8 more dogs arrive, James needs 8 more toys to bring the total to 12 dogs with 1 toy each. So, he buys 8 more toys.

Now, there are 12 dogs, and James goes back to find that there are twice as many more dogs, which means there are 2 * 8 = 16 more dogs. This makes a total of 12 + 16 = 28 dogs. Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 28 more toys.

However, when James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys. This means he needs 28 - 3 = 25 more toys.

To find the total number of toys James needs, we add the initial 4 toys he had to the 8 toys he bought first and the 28 toys he bought the second time, and then subtract the 3 toys he no longer needs.

Total toys needed = 4 (initial toys) + 8 (first purchase) + 28 (second purchase) - 3 (toys no longer needed)
Total toys needed = 37

"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we first need to determine her hourly wage. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Karen works in two days. Since she works 3 hours per day, in two days she works 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we can multiply Karen's hourly wage by the number of hours she works to find her total earnings: $20 * 6 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we need to determine the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. 

Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can calculate the ratio as follows: 

36 hash browns / 6 potatoes = 6 hash browns per potato

Now, we can multiply this ratio by the total number of potatoes to find the total number of hash browns that can be made:

6 hash browns per potato * 96 potatoes = 576 hash browns

"To find the total weight of the 9 adults, we need to multiply the average weight of an adult by the number of adults. 

Total weight = average weight of an adult * number of adults
Total weight = 80 kg * 9
Total weight = 720 kg

Since the elevator supports a maximum load of 700 kg, we need to find the excess weight by subtracting the maximum load from the total weight.

Excess weight = Total weight - maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

"To find the total number of cookies, we need to determine the number of cookies each person has. 

We know Katarina has 68 cookies. 

Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, we can find the total number of cookies by adding the number of cookies each person has: 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298.

The final answer is: 298"
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to consider the two changes made to the dress. 

First, the dress is extended by 50% of its original length. If we let the original length be 'x', then the extended length is x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

Next, 20cm is added to the bottom of the dress. So, the final length is 1.5x + 20.

We are given that the final length is 140cm. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. Subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

1.5x = 120

Now, divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 80

"To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode and then add them together.

First, let's find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in turtle mode. Since it takes 1 hour to mow the entire lawn in turtle mode, it will take 1/2 hour to mow half the lawn in turtle mode. We need to convert 1/2 hour to minutes, which is 30 minutes.

Next, let's find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode. Since it takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn in rabbit mode, it will take 40/2 = 20 minutes to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode.

Now, we add the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode: 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much longer they have to get to school without being late, we need to calculate the total time it takes to get to the fire station and then subtract that from the total time they have to get to school.

They have 30 minutes to get to school. 

It takes them 6 minutes to get to the corner where the library is, and another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. So, the total time it takes to get to the fire station is 6 + 13 = 19 minutes.

Since they have already used 19 minutes, we subtract that from the total time they have to get to school: 30 - 19 = 11 minutes.

They have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late. 

The final answer is: 11"

"Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as T+7 - 7 = T. 

Since there are two twins and one triplet, the total age is 2T + (T) = 3T. We are given that their combined ages are 44, so we can set up the equation 3T = 44.

To find T, we divide both sides of the equation by 3: T = 44 / 3. 

T = 14.67. However, since age must be a whole number, we need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-examine the problem. If one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, then the triplet's age is T, the twin's age is T+7, and the other twin's age is T+7+7 = T+14.

The total age is 3T + 7, and we are given that their combined ages are 44, so we can set up the equation 3T + 7 = 44.

To find T, we subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: 3T = 44 - 7. 

3T = 37. 

To find T, we divide both sides of the equation by 3: T = 37 / 3.

T = 12.33. However, since age must be a whole number, we need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-examine the problem. If one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, then the triplet's age is T, the twin's age is T+7, and the other twin's age is T+7+7 = T+14.

The total age is 2T + (T+7) + (T+14) = 4T + 21, and we are given that their combined ages are 44, so we can set up the equation 4T + 21 = 44.

To find T, we subtract 21 from both sides of the equation: 4T = 44 - 21.

4T = 23.

To find T, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: T = 23 / 4.

T = 5.75. However, since age must be a whole number, we need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-examine the problem. If one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, then the triplet's age is T, the twin's age is T+7, and the other twin's age is T+7+7 = T+14.

The total age is 2(T+7) + T = 3T + 14, and we are given that their combined ages are 44, so we can set up the equation 3T + 14 = 44.

To find T, we subtract 14 from both sides of the equation: 3T = 44 - 14.

3T = 30.

To find T, we divide both sides of the equation by 3: T = 30 / 3.

T = 10.

One of the twins is 10 + 7 = 17 years old.

"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to find the cost of one candy. 

We know that Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for $3.20. The cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2. 

Now, we subtract the cost of 5 lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of 4 candies: $3.20 - $2 = $1.20. 

The cost of one candy is $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, we can find the total cost of 10 lollipops: 10 * $0.40 = $4.

The total cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4 + $3 = $7.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many coins Rong and Neil save per month. 

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so we need to find 2/5 of 20 and add it to 20. 
2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. 
So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, we need to find out how many months they have been saving coins. They have been saving coins for 10 years. 
There are 12 months in a year, so they have been saving coins for 10 * 12 = 120 months.

Now, we need to find out how many coins Rong and Neil have saved in total. 
Rong saves 20 coins per month, so in 120 months, he will save 20 * 120 = 2400 coins. 
Neil saves 28 coins per month, so in 120 months, he will save 28 * 120 = 3360 coins.

The total number of coins they have is 2400 + 3360 = 5760.

"To find the total bill, we first need to calculate the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, which we don't know yet. Let's call the total bill 'x'. The cost of the heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, divide both sides by 0.4 to find x: x = $100.

So, the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check is $40 + $60 = $100.

John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

"To find the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter, we need to calculate the total number of squares and multiply it by the area of each square, which is 1 square foot.

We know that there are 14 red squares. 
There are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so there are 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.
There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so there are 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.
There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so there are 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, let's add up the total number of squares: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68 squares.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find out how many chairs Mia needs, we first need to determine the total number of chairs she has. Since there are 8 high chairs and the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs by multiplying 8 by 5.

8 high chairs * 5 = 40 regular chairs

Now, we add the number of high chairs and regular chairs to find the total number of chairs.

8 high chairs + 40 regular chairs = 48 chairs

Since there will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending, we need to find the total number of chairs required. Babies will use high chairs, so we add the number of adults and babies.

42 adults + 15 babies = 57 people

Since each person needs a chair, we need 57 chairs in total. To find out how many more chairs Mia needs, we subtract the number of chairs she has from the total number of chairs required.

57 total chairs - 48 available chairs = 9 more chairs

Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom, so Martha has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by Adam, Betty, Martha, and Tom: 50 + 65 + 105 + 35 = 255 points.

Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people. When they meet up with 7 more friends, the total number of people becomes 13 + 7 = 20.

Since each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks, we can calculate the total number of drinks and snacks as follows:

Total number of drinks = 20 people * 2 drinks/person = 40 drinks
Total number of snacks = 20 people * 3 snacks/person = 60 snacks

The cost of each drink and snack is $2. Therefore, the total cost of drinks is 40 drinks * $2/drinks = $80, and the total cost of snacks is 60 snacks * $2/snack = $120.

"To find out how many hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we need to first determine how much they need to raise per hour to reach their goal. 

The total amount they need to raise is $6300, and they have already raised $2100 in 3 hours. 

The amount they need to raise in total is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

Since they need to raise $4200 in total and they have already raised $2100 in 3 hours, we can find the amount they need to raise per hour by dividing the remaining amount by the number of hours they have already worked.

$4200 / 3 hours = $1400 per hour.

Now, we can find the total number of hours they need to fundraise by dividing the total amount they need to raise by the amount they need to raise per hour.

$4200 / $1400 per hour = 3 hours.

However, this is the amount of time they need to raise the remaining $4200. Since they have already worked 3 hours, we need to add this to the time they need to raise the remaining amount.

Total hours = 3 hours (already worked) + 3 hours (to raise the remaining amount) = 6 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the rate at which the factory makes chocolate and vanilla ice cream per hour.

For chocolate ice cream, the factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours. To find the rate per hour, we divide the total quarts by the number of hours: 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour.

For vanilla ice cream, the factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours. To find the rate per hour, we divide the total quarts by the number of hours: 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we need to find the total quarts made in 48 hours. We multiply the rate per hour for each flavor by the total number of hours and add the results together: (50 quarts/hour * 48 hours) + (12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours) = 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many scoops Erin can buy with her $6.00. Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide the total amount of money Erin has by the cost of each scoop.

$6.00 ÷ $1.50 = 4

This means Erin can buy 4 scoops of ice cream. However, the deal is buy 2 scoops get 1 free, so we need to consider the free scoop as well. 

Since Erin can buy 4 scoops, and the deal is buy 2 get 1 free, she can buy 2 sets of 3 scoops (2 paid scoops + 1 free scoop). 

2 sets of 3 scoops = 6 scoops

So, Erin should buy 6 scoops of ice cream.

"To find the new price of each computer, we need to calculate 10% of the original price and add it to the original price. 

Original price per computer = $700
Increase in price = 10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70
New price per computer = Original price + Increase in price = $700 + $70 = $770

Now, we can find the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices.

Total number of computers = 500
Total amount paid = New price per computer * Total number of computers = $770 * 500 = $385,000

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many slices were eaten by Bryce and his friends, and then subtract that from the total number of slices.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 5 people in total, including Bryce, and 2/3 of them ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we can calculate the number of slices eaten by this group. 

First, let's find out how many slices Bryce and his two friends ate in total. Since each pizza has 12 slices, and there are 5 people, there are 5 pizzas in total. 

2/3 of 5 pizzas is (2/3) * 5 = 10/3 pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices eaten by this group is (10/3) * 12 = 40 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 5 people in total, and 3 of them ate 2/3 of their pizzas, the remaining 2 friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. 

2/3 of 2 pizzas is (2/3) * 2 = 4/3 pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices eaten by the remaining friends is (4/3) * 12 = 16 slices.

Now, let's add the slices eaten by both groups: 40 slices + 16 slices = 56 slices.

Since there are 5 pizzas in total, and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60 slices.

Now, let's subtract the slices eaten from the total number of slices: 60 - 56 = 4 slices.

"To find the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages, we need to calculate 2/3 of the time it takes the cat. 

The cat eats the sausages in 30 minutes. 
2/3 of 30 minutes is (2/3) * 30 = 20 minutes.

So, the dog eats the sausages in 20 minutes.

To find the average time, we need to add the time taken by the cat and the dog and divide by 2.

Average time = (30 + 20) / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25 minutes.

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we multiply 8 feet by 12 and add 4 inches.

8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches
Adding 4 inches to that gives us 100 inches for the length of one of Topher's shoes.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. We can write the equation as:

100 = 9x + 10

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:

100 - 10 = 9x + 10 - 10
90 = 9x

Next, we need to get 'x' by itself. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 9:

90 / 9 = 9x / 9
10 = x

"To find the total number of windows smashed by Hannah, we need to calculate the number of windows from students' cars and teachers' cars separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of windows from students' cars. There are 64 students' cars with 4 windows each. So, the total number of windows from students' cars is 64 * 4 = 256.

Next, let's find the number of windows from teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars with 2 windows each. Since Hannah smashed 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, we need to calculate 3/4 * 32 * 2. 

3/4 * 32 * 2 = (3/4) * 64 = 48

Now, we add the number of windows from students' cars and teachers' cars to get the total number of windows smashed by Hannah.

256 + 48 = 304

"To determine the total number of smores needed, we first calculate the number of smores required for the kids and the adults separately.

9 kids want 2 smores each, so the total number of smores for kids is 9 * 2 = 18.

6 adults will eat 1 s'more each, so the total number of smores for adults is 6 * 1 = 6.

The total number of smores needed is 18 (for kids) + 6 (for adults) = 24.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores, we need to divide the total number of smores needed by 8 to find out how many sleeves are required. 

24 smores / 8 smores per sleeve = 3 sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need to divide the total number of sleeves required by 3 to find out how many boxes are needed.

3 sleeves / 3 sleeves per box = 1 box.

Therefore, they will need 1 box of graham crackers.

"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we first need to determine their individual ages.

Given that Dora is 15 years old, we can find her father's age by using the information that his age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 

Father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8
Father's age = 2 * 15 + 8
Father's age = 30 + 8
Father's age = 38

Next, we know that Dora's mother is four years younger than her father. 

Mother's age = Father's age - 4
Mother's age = 38 - 4
Mother's age = 34

Now that we have the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother, we can find the total combined age.

Total combined age = Dora's age + Father's age + Mother's age
Total combined age = 15 + 38 + 34
Total combined age = 87

"To find the number of votes candidate C received, we first need to determine the number of votes candidate B received. 

Candidate A received 20% of the votes, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes.

Candidate B received 50% more than candidate A's votes, so we need to calculate 50% of 20 and add it to 20. 
50% of 20 is 0.5 * 20 = 10. 
So, candidate B received 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

Since there are 100 voters in total, the total number of votes is 100. 
Candidate A and B together received 20 + 30 = 50 votes. 
Therefore, candidate C received 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

54 students / 6 groups = 9 students per group

However, the problem states that the activity requires 12 groups. To find out how many students are needed for 12 groups, we can multiply the number of students per group by the number of groups.

9 students per group * 12 groups = 108 students

Since there are 54 students, we need to find out how many more students are needed to reach 108 students. 

108 students - 54 students = 54 students

However, the question asks for the number of groups needed, not the number of students. Since we already know that 54 students are needed for 6 groups, we can find out how many groups are needed for 54 students by dividing the number of students by the number of students per group.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

First, she trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. 
Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading 27 small stickers.

Now, she has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. 
Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons from trading 20 large stickers.

Now, she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. 
Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from trading 20 large stickers.

Now, let's calculate the total number of buttons she has. 
She has 27 small buttons from trading small stickers, 20 large buttons from trading large stickers, and 60 small buttons from trading large stickers. 
So, the total number of buttons she has is 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 buttons.

On Monday, Joey played 2 matches. 
On Friday, he played 1 match. 
On Saturday, he played double the number of matches he played on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 matches.

Now, let's add up the total number of matches: 2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7 matches.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as 'x'. Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, the number of votes in favor can be represented as 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33. The total number of votes in favor and against the new regulation must add up to 33. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Now that we know the number of votes against the new regulation is 11, we can find the number of votes in favor by multiplying x by 2:

Votes in favor = 2x = 2 * 11 = 22

The final answer is: 22"

So, you will pay $133 after the discount.

The final answer is: $133"
"To find the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last, we need to first find the total number of songs in all the playlists. 

Number of songs in one playlist = 300
Number of playlists = 20
Total number of songs = Number of songs in one playlist * Number of playlists
Total number of songs = 300 * 20
Total number of songs = 6000

Since each song is 10 hours long, we can find the total number of hours by multiplying the total number of songs by the length of each song.

Total number of hours = Total number of songs * Length of each song
Total number of hours = 6000 * 10
Total number of hours = 60000

The final answer is: 60000"
"To find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we first need to find the number of people who think horse #2 will win and then the number of people who think horse #7 will win.

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

The remaining people are 50 - 10 = 40 people. 
60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. 
60% of 40 = 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. 
So, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 40 - 24 = 16 people.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total number of puppies Jana has, we first need to determine the total number of Pomeranians. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls and there are 6 Pomeranian girls, we can set up the equation:

1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides by 3:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can set up the equation:

2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

Total Puppies = 18 * (3/2)
Total Puppies = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much more Jayden needs to buy the camera, we first need to calculate how much money he has after receiving the money from his sister. 

Jayden initially had $70. His sister gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. 

So, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115.

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera: $200 - $115 = $85.

Therefore, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.

The final answer is: $85"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

Let's denote the number of cases of shingles the second house needs as 'x'. Since the first house needs 1/2 of what the second house needs, the first house needs x/2 cases of shingles. 

The third house needs double the first house, so it needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases of shingles.

We know that the total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + x/2 + x = 250.

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + x + 2x = 500.

Combining like terms, we get 5x = 500.

Dividing both sides by 5, we get x = 100.

Since the third house needs x cases of shingles, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

The final answer is: 100"

"To find the number of pears George has, we need to calculate 45% of the number of bananas and add it to the number of bananas. 

First, let's find 45% of 200 bananas:
45% of 200 = 0.45 * 200 = 90

Now, let's add this to the number of bananas:
200 (bananas) + 90 (additional pears) = 290

Since George has 45% more pears than bananas, we can say that the number of pears is 290. However, the question asks for the total number of fruits. To find this, we need to add the number of bananas to the number of pears:
200 (bananas) + 290 (pears) = 490

"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to subtract the cost of the ball from the amount of money she had initially. 

Marissa had $80 and spent $20 on the ball. 

$80 (initial money) - $20 (cost of the ball) = $60

Now, we need to find out how many candy bars she can buy with $60, given that each candy bar costs $5.

$60 (remaining money) / $5 (cost of each candy bar) = 12

So, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

12"
"To find out how much money Sam needs to spend, we first need to determine how many kilograms of oranges are required to make 4 liters of juice. Since Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges to make 1 liter of juice, we can multiply this by 4 to get the total amount of oranges needed for 4 liters.

5 kilograms/orange * 4 liters/orange = 20 kilograms/orange

Now, we know that each kilogram of oranges costs $3. To find the total cost, we multiply the total amount of oranges needed by the cost per kilogram.

20 kilograms/orange * $3/kilogram = $60

So, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice. 

$60"
"To find out how many books Ahmed read, we need to divide the number of books Ezra read by 2, since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed. 

Ezra read 300 books, so Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Now, we need to add the number of books Ezra decided to read to the number of books he has already read. Ezra decided to read 150 more books, so he will have read 300 + 150 = 450 books.

To find the total number of books they have read altogether, we need to add the number of books Ezra has read to the number of books Ahmed has read. 

Total books read = 450 (Ezra) + 150 (Ahmed) = 600

"To find out how much Tanya earned, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately and then add them together.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total earnings for the hours worked would be 5 hours * $15/hour = $75. Additionally, she earns $5 per day for teaching more than 3 classes, so she earns an extra $5 for Monday. Therefore, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her earnings for the hours worked would be 2 hours * $15/hour = $30. Since she teaches less than 3 classes, she does not earn the extra $5 per day. Therefore, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

Now, let's add her earnings for both days: $80 (Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) = $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"To find the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

The company sold 5 vanilla scents and there are 4 vanilla scents available, so the total number of vanilla scents sold is 5 * 4 = 20.

The company sold 2 fruity scents and there are 8 fruity scents available, so the total number of fruity scents sold is 2 * 8 = 16.

Now, we need to find the difference between the total number of vanilla scents sold and the total number of fruity scents sold. 

Difference = Total vanilla scents sold - Total fruity scents sold
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate how much money Bennet will make from selling the eggplants. 

He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount he will make from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, and he will make $60 from eggplants, he needs to make $135 - $60 = $75 from selling the corn.

He has 25 ears of corn, and he needs to make $75 from them. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the total amount he needs to make from corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25).

$75 / 25 = $3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total time Tatiana has available for soccer, video games, and reading, we need to add the hours she has on Saturday and Sunday. 

Total time available = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

She reads for 3 hours, so the remaining time for soccer and video games is:
Remaining time = Total time available - Time spent reading = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time:
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

Now, we can find the time spent playing soccer:
Time spent playing soccer = Remaining time - Time spent playing video games = 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time available and multiply by 100:
Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (Time spent playing soccer / Total time available) * 100
= (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100

"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps of the problem.

Initially, Anthony had 50 pencils.

He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon. To find out how many pencils he gave to Brandon, we multiply 50 by 1/2:
50 * 1/2 = 25 pencils given to Brandon.

Now, Anthony has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.

He then gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. To find out how many pencils he gave to Charlie, we multiply 25 by 3/5:
25 * 3/5 = 15 pencils given to Charlie.

Now, Anthony has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

So, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to drive to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Jack to drive to the museum:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time = 2 hours

Since he drives to the museum and back, we need to multiply the time by 2:

Total driving time = 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours

Now, we add the time he spends at the museum to the total driving time:

Total time = Total driving time + Time at the museum
Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time = 10 hours

"To find out how many wheels Henry will need in total, we need to calculate the number of wheels required for the cars and the motorcycles separately, and then add them together.

For the cars, Henry needs 4 wheels for each of the 57 cars, so the total number of wheels required for the cars is 57 * 4 = 228.

For the motorcycles, Henry needs 2 wheels for each of the 73 motorcycles, so the total number of wheels required for the motorcycles is 73 * 2 = 146.

Now, we add the total number of wheels required for the cars and the motorcycles: 228 + 146 = 374.

Since Henry has a box with 650 wheels in it, we subtract the total number of wheels required from the total number of wheels available: 650 - 374 = 276.

The final answer is: 276"

"To find the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we need to calculate the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the remaining movies.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. A third of the movies are in series, so we can calculate this as:

600 / 3 = 200 movies in series

Since Mike can get these movies for only $6 of the cost of a normal movie, we can calculate the cost of the series as:

200 * $6 = $1200

Next, let's find the number of older movies. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we need to find the number of remaining movies first. We subtract the movies in series from the total number of movies:

600 - 200 = 400 remaining movies

Then, we find 40% of the remaining movies:

400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies

The cost of the older movies is:

160 * $5 = $800

Now, we need to find the number of remaining movies that are not in series and not older movies. We subtract the movies in series and older movies from the total number of movies:

600 - 200 - 160 = 240 remaining movies

The cost of the remaining movies is:

240 * $10 = $2400

Finally, we add up the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the remaining movies to find the total cost:

$1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400

The final answer is: $4400"

"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance they traveled by driving and hiking, and then add them together.

First, let's find the speed at which they hiked. They hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Their driving speed was 50 miles per hour. Half of 50 is 25, and 5 miles per hour less than that is 20 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the distance they traveled by driving. They drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time, so the distance they traveled by driving is 50 * 6 = 300 miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance they traveled by hiking. They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time, so the distance they traveled by hiking is 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

Now, let's add the distance they traveled by driving and hiking to find the total distance to their vacation spot. Total distance = 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the points each of them gets from enemies, berries, and the timer.

Let's assume Emma's score from enemies is x. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava's score from enemies will be x + 8.

Emma's score from berries is 3 (since she collects 3 berries), and Ava collects 3 + 3 = 6 berries.

Now, let's consider the timer. The longer Ava takes, the lower her score will be. Since Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma, let's assume Emma finishes the level in t seconds. Then, Ava finishes in t + 4 seconds.

Emma's score from the timer is 30t, and Ava's score from the timer is 30(t + 4).

The total score for Emma is x + 3 + 30t, and the total score for Ava is x + 8 + 6 + 30(t + 4).

Simplifying Ava's total score, we get x + 8 + 6 + 30t + 120 = x + 134 + 30t.

The difference in their scores is (x + 134 + 30t) - (x + 3 + 30t) = 131.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of times they ride their bikes on the usual days and the days when they ride twice the usual times.

On usual days, they ride 3 times a day for 5 days. So, the total number of times they ride on usual days is 3 * 5 = 15.

On the two days when they ride twice the usual times, they ride 2 * 3 = 6 times a day. Since there are 2 such days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

Now, we add the total number of times they ride on usual days and the days when they ride twice the usual times: 15 + 12 = 27.

So, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is 27.

"Let's break down the information given. Initially, Bob had 7 fish in his pond, with 3 being orange and 4 being white. 

Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as 'w' and the number of orange fish he bought as 'o'. 

When Bob added the fish to his pond, he had a total of 7 + w + o fish. The number of orange fish in the pond became 3 + o, and the number of white fish became 4 + w.

We are given that after adding the fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This can be represented as:

3 + o = 2(4 + w)

Simplifying the equation:

3 + o = 8 + 2w

Subtract 3 from both sides:

o = 5 + 2w

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, which is the sum of the white and orange fish he bought. This can be represented as:

w + o = 17

Substituting the expression for o from the previous equation:

w + (5 + 2w) = 17

Combine like terms:

3w + 5 = 17

Subtract 5 from both sides:

3w = 12

Divide both sides by 3:

w = 4

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

The final answer is: 4"
"To calculate the weekly fuel consumption, we need to determine the total miles driven per week and then divide it by the car's fuel efficiency.

The one-way distance between home and office is 5 miles, and Andy drives to and from work, so the total distance per day is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles.

Since Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, the total miles driven per week is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Now, we can calculate the fuel consumption per week by dividing the total miles driven by the car's fuel efficiency: 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

The price of regular gas is $3/gallon, so the weekly fuel cost is 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Carrie had initially and then subtract the amount she spent.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie had initially. She was given 10 twenties and 140 quarters.

The value of 10 twenties is 10 x $20 = $200.
The value of 140 quarters is 140 x $0.25 = $35.

So, the total amount of money Carrie had initially is $200 + $35 = $235.

Carrie spent all the quarters, which is $35, and 3/5 of the twenties, which is 3/5 x $200 = $120.

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to determine the total percentage of smart TVs and analog TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 or 0.25. One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 or 0.125. 

The total percentage of smart TVs and analog TVs sold is 0.25 + 0.125 = 0.375. 

Since the rest of the TVs are OLED, we subtract the total percentage of smart and analog TVs from 1 (which represents 100% of the total TVs). 

1 - 0.375 = 0.625. 

This 0.625 represents the percentage of OLED TVs sold. To find the actual number of OLED TVs sold, we multiply this percentage by the total number of TVs sold, which is 40.

0.625 * 40 = 25

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the temperature at night and then calculate how many logs Carson needs to burn to reach the minimum temperature of 32 degrees.

First, let's find the temperature at night. It's 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the day, and the day temperature is 45 degrees. 

Night temperature = Day temperature - 33
Night temperature = 45 - 33
Night temperature = 12 degrees

Since the pipes will freeze at 32 degrees, Carson needs to heat the house from 12 degrees to 32 degrees. 

Temperature increase needed = 32 - 12
Temperature increase needed = 20 degrees

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we divide the temperature increase needed by the heat per log.

Number of logs = Temperature increase needed / Heat per log
Number of logs = 20 / 5
Number of logs = 4

Since 90 people were split into 9-person groups, we can find the total number of groups by dividing 90 by 9.

90 / 9 = 10 groups

Since 3/5 of the groups brought back seashells, we can find the number of groups that brought back seashells by multiplying the total number of groups by 3/5.

10 * (3/5) = 6 groups

First, we know there are 12 female lions. The number of male lions is half the number of female lions, so the number of male lions is 12 / 2 = 6.

Next, we add the number of male lions to the number of female lions: 12 (female lions) + 6 (male lions) = 18.

Then, we add the number of lion cubs to the total number of adult lions: 18 (adult lions) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32.

The total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans and then subtract that from the $50 bill.

First, let's calculate the discount amount: 
Discount = 25% of $40 = 0.25 * $40 = $10

Now, let's calculate the discounted price of the jeans:
Discounted price = Original price - Discount = $40 - $10 = $30

Now, let's calculate how much money Mike will have left over:
Money left over = $50 - $30 = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first determine the total number of employees after three months. 

The company initially has 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. So, after one month, the total number of employees will be 200 + 20 = 220. 

After two months, the total number of employees will be 220 + 20 = 240. 

After three months, the total number of employees will be 240 + 20 = 260.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees. Each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month. 

The total amount of money paid to the initial 200 employees is 200 * $4000 = $800,000.

The total amount of money paid to the 20 new employees hired in the first month is 20 * $4000 = $80,000.

The total amount of money paid to the 20 new employees hired in the second month is 20 * $4000 = $80,000.

The total amount of money paid to the 20 new employees hired in the third month is 20 * $4000 = $80,000.

The total amount of money paid to all employees after three months is $800,000 + $80,000 + $80,000 + $80,000 = $1,140,000.

The final answer is: $1,140,000"
"To find the total time the choir will be caroling, we need to add the time it takes to sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice and the time it takes to sing ""Jingle Bells"" once.

First, let's calculate the total time for ""Deck the Halls"": 2 songs * 150 seconds/song = 300 seconds.

Next, let's add the time for ""Jingle Bells"": 300 seconds + 240 seconds = 540 seconds.

The choir will be caroling for 540 seconds.

"To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we first need to calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours.

Billy's initial hourly wage was $10. After 2 months, he got a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new hourly wage $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. After another year, he got a raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final hourly wage $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Billy's total earnings for 20 hours of work at $11.50 per hour is 20 * $11.50 = $230.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, which was $10. So Sally's starting salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. 

Sally's total earnings for 20 hours of work at $10.50 per hour is 20 * $10.50 = $210.

The difference in their earnings is $230 - $210 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To find the difference in cost between 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels, we need to calculate the total cost of each and then subtract the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread.

The cost of 3 loaves of bread is 3 x $2 = $6.

The cost of 2 bagels is 2 x $1 = $2.

Now, we subtract the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread: $6 - $2 = $4.

The difference in cost is $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To find Nikita's score, we need to calculate half of Pierson's score and then add 11. 

Pierson's score is 278. Half of 278 is 278 / 2 = 139. 

Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score, so Nikita's score is 139 + 11 = 150.

To find the total score, we need to add Pierson's score and Nikita's score. 

Pierson's score is 278 and Nikita's score is 150. 

278 + 150 = 428.

The final answer is: 428"
"To find the total number of trees planted by the students, we need to multiply the number of classes by the average number of students per class and then multiply the result by 1 (since each student plants 1 tree).

Total students = 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students
Total trees planted by students = 1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees

To find the total number of trees planted by the teachers, we need to multiply the number of classes by the average number of teachers per class and then multiply the result by 2 (since each teacher plants 2 trees).

Total teachers = 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers
Total trees planted by teachers = 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees

Now, we add the total number of trees planted by students and teachers to find the overall number of trees planted.

Total trees = 1000 trees (by students) + 240 trees (by teachers) = 1240 trees

The final answer is: 1240"
"To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. 

30% of 14 = 0.3 * 14 = 4.2

Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we'll consider the context of the problem. If Bubbles buys 5 stuffed goats, the percentage of stuffed goats will be 5/19, which is approximately 26.32%. This is less than 30%. If she buys 6 stuffed goats, the percentage of stuffed goats will be 6/19, which is approximately 31.58%. This is more than 30%. Therefore, Bubbles should buy 5 stuffed goats to get as close to 30% as possible.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total hours Kris has played and subtract that from the target of 30 hours.

First, let's calculate the hours Kris played in the first 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days. If Kris plays for half an hour every day, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in the first 2 weeks.

Next, let's calculate the hours Kris played in the next week. If Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in the next week.

Now, let's add the hours Kris played in both periods: 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we subtract the total hours played from the target of 30 hours: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

So, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time.

The first car travels at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 miles/hour x 2 hours = 120 miles

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 70 miles/hour x 2 hours = 140 miles

Since the second car was initially passing the first car, we need to find the distance between them after 2 hours. The second car has traveled 140 miles, and the first car has traveled 120 miles. The distance between them is the difference between the two distances:
Distance = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost James paid for the ring, we need to calculate the premium first. The premium is 30% of the total cost of the diamond and gold, which is $600 + $300 = $900.

The premium is 30% of $900, which is 0.3 x $900 = $270.

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the diamond and gold: $900 + $270 = $1170.

So, James paid $1170 for the ring.

The final answer is: $1170"
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade:

- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice the fourth-graders', so it's 2 * 40 = 80 out of 100 passed

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed:
340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 80 (fifth-graders) = 460 students passed

Next, let's calculate the total number of students in the school:
500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000 students

Now, we can find the overall pass rate:
(460 students passed / 1000 total students) * 100 = 46%

The final answer is: 46"
"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we first need to determine how many square inches of mosaic he can make with the glass chips he has. 

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, and each bag holds 72 chips, we can calculate the total number of chips Milo has: 2 bags * 72 chips per bag = 144 chips.

Now, we need to find out how many square inches of mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch, we divide the total number of chips by 12: 144 chips / 12 chips per square inch = 12 square inches.

Since the mosaic is three inches tall, and we know the area of the mosaic (12 square inches), we can find the length by dividing the area by the height: 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches.

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount each group of students drank and add them together. 

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so the total amount they drank is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. 

16 students drank 2 quarts each, so the total amount they drank is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we know that 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts. 

So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party in gallons is 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to first determine how many candies he has in total. 

Dale initially ordered 100 candies and then ordered 100 more. So, the total number of candies he has is 100 + 100 = 200.

However, he has already sold 150 candies. To find out how many he still needs to sell, we subtract the number of candies sold from the total number of candies he has. 

200 (total candies) - 150 (candies sold) = 50

So, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of each month and then subtract the initial number of students from it.

At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students.

- At the end of January, the number of students doubles, so there are 10 * 2 = 20 students.
- At the end of February, the number of students doubles again, so there are 20 * 2 = 40 students.
- At the end of March, the number of students doubles again, so there are 40 * 2 = 80 students.
- At the end of April, the number of students doubles again, so there are 80 * 2 = 160 students.
- At the end of May, the number of students doubles again, so there are 160 * 2 = 320 students.

Now, let's subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May: 320 - 10 = 310.

The number of additional students who joined by the end of May is 310."
"To find the total number of branches Felix climbed, we need to divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch. 

Total money made: $105
Cost per branch: $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week, which has 5 days, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 5
Average branches per day = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers and then subtract the petals that were dropped.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, we need to subtract 4 petals (1 from each set) from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

The final answer is: 97"
"To find out how many marshmallows are left in the bag, we need to subtract the total number of marshmallows used and the ones dropped from the initial amount. 

John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores, so together they made 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores. This means they used 18 marshmallows. 

They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. 

So, the total number of marshmallows used or dropped is 18 + 3 = 21.

Now, let's subtract this from the initial amount of marshmallows: 35 - 21 = 14.

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the number of S'mores they can make with the remaining marshmallows is 14.

To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 (since there are two kids). 

14 / 2 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person plays and then determine how many quarters are used.

Jack plays for 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. Since he can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, he uses 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

One of his friends is significantly worse and can play for half as long as Jack, so they play for 240 / 2 = 120 minutes. This friend uses 120 / 20 = 6 quarters.

The other two friends are significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they play for 240 * 1.5 = 360 minutes. Each of them uses 360 / 20 = 18 quarters.

Since there are two friends who play for 360 minutes, they use a total of 2 * 18 = 36 quarters.

The total number of quarters used is 12 (Jack) + 6 (worse friend) + 36 (better friends) = 54 quarters.

The cost of each quarter is $0.25, so the total amount of money used is 54 * $0.25 = $13.50.

The final answer is: $13.50"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as Z, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of salt as S, the amount of sugar as Su, and the amount of oil as O.

We are given that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so F = Z.

We are also given that she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so S = Su.

Additionally, she uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.

And she uses twice as much salt as zest, so S = 2Z.

Since F = Z, we can substitute F with Z in the equation S = 2Z, which gives us S = 2Z and also F = 2Z.

Now we have O = 2S and S = 2Z. We can substitute S with 2Z in the equation O = 2S, which gives us O = 2(2Z) = 4Z.

We are also given that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces. The total amount of the mixture is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients, so Z + F + S + Su + O = 10.

Since F = Z and S = Su = 2Z, we can substitute these values in the equation, which gives us Z + Z + 2Z + 2Z + 4Z = 10.

Combine like terms to get 10Z = 10.

Divide both sides by 10 to get Z = 1.

Now that we know Z = 1, we can find the amount of oil. Since O = 4Z, we can substitute Z = 1 in the equation, which gives us O = 4(1) = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of the goats is 3 * $500 = $1500.

"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Paul needs 63 cupcakes in total. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, so the total number of cupcakes he has is 8 + 40 = 48.

Now, let's subtract the number of cupcakes he has from the total number of cupcakes he needs: 63 - 48 = 15.

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars. So, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2. 40 * 0.2 = 8. So, Joe sells 8 cars.

3. Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

4. Now, let's find out how many cars Joe has left. He started with 40 cars, sold 8, and gave away 16. So, he has 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars left.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to first determine the total amount raised by the students. Since the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, the amount raised by the students is $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Now, we know that there are 20 students and they all raised the same amount. To find out how much each student raised, we divide the total amount raised by the number of students: $125,000 / 20 = $6,250.

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day, then add them together.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time in minutes, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes
4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 480 + 240 = 720 minutes.

"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to first determine the total number of cars in the parking lot after the first break. 

Initially, there were 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars after the first break is 50 + 20 = 70.

When Hunter got out of class for the lunch break, he realized that 1/2 the number of cars in the parking lot had gone. This means that 1/2 of 70 cars left, and the remaining 1/2 stayed. 

To find the number of cars that left, we multiply 70 by 1/2: 70 * 1/2 = 35. 

Since 1/2 of the cars left, the number of cars that stayed is also 35. 

Now, to find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to add the number of cars that left and the number of cars that stayed. However, the question asks for the total number of cars he counted during the lunch break, which is the number of cars that left plus the number of cars that stayed. 

So, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35 (cars that left) + 35 (cars that stayed) = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 different tasks. So, the total number of tasks he completes in a day is:
30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day

Since each task pays $1.20, the total amount John makes in a day is:
150 tasks/day * $1.20/task = $180/day

John works a full 7-day week, so the total amount he makes in a week is:
$180/day * 7 days/week = $1260/week

"To find the total points Sasha scored in both games, we need to calculate her points in each game and add them together.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game. Therefore, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored, we add her points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18.

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as 'x'. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. We can write the equation as x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341.

Combine like terms: 7x + 12 = 341.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329.

Divide both sides by 7: x = 47.

Since PJ has x cards, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has 3x cards, so Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards. Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has 3 * 47 + 12 = 147 cards.

"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs and then add them together.

Cindy had 5 green eggs. 
She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.
She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

"To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and subtract the refund amount from the purchase price.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The book weighs 4 pounds and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound, so the weight-based shipping cost is 4 * $0.35 = $1.40. The book needs to be returned 20 miles away, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile, so the distance-based shipping cost is 20 * $0.08 = $1.60. The total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $2.99.

Now, let's calculate the refund amount. Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price, which is 0.75 * $32 = $24.

The total cost of shipping is $2.99, and the refund amount is $24. To find out how much Milly will lose, we subtract the refund amount from the shipping cost: $2.99 - $24 = -$21.91. However, since we can't lose a negative amount of money, we need to recalculate the refund amount as the difference between the shipping cost and the refund amount. 

The correct calculation is: $2.99 - $24 = -$21.01. However, since we can't lose a negative amount of money, we need to recalculate the refund amount as the difference between the shipping cost and the refund amount.

"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she spent and subtract it from the initial amount she had, including the money her father gave her.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Mulan had initially: $40 (initial money) + $100 (money from her father) = $140.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money she spent: 2 pairs of jeans at $30 each = 2 x $30 = $60, and a bag for $20. So, the total amount spent is $60 + $20 = $80.

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $140 - $80 = $60.

So, Mulan has $60 left.

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for the first three weeks and then determine the pattern.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.
In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, we can find out how much he produces in the fourth week by subtracting the production of the first three weeks from the total production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

The final answer is: 14,000"
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on TikTok in a week and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the time she spends on TikTok in a week:

- Time spent recording videos: 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes
- Time spent writing songs: 2 hours = 120 minutes
- Time spent doing makeup: 15 minutes * 6 days = 90 minutes

Total time spent on TikTok in a week = 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly time by 4:
282 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1128 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
1128 minutes / 60 = 18.8 hours

The final answer is: 18.8"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to find the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. However, Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. Since the initial installation already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier, we only need to consider the additional items.

Angela has 2 extra mirrors (6 - 4 = 2), 1 extra chandelier (2 - 1 = 1), and 10 extra pictures (20 - 10 = 10). The cost of the additional items is $15.00 per item.

The total number of additional items is 2 (mirrors) + 1 (chandelier) + 10 (pictures) = 13 items.

The cost of the additional items is 13 items * $15.00 per item = $195.00.

The initial installation cost is $129.00.

The total cost is $129.00 (initial installation) + $195.00 (additional items) = $324.00.

The final answer is: $324.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money Anthony has saved, and then calculate 40% more than that amount.

First, we know that Eva has saved $20.00. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Since Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, we need to find 40% of $30.00 and add it to $30.00. 

40% of $30.00 is 0.4 x $30.00 = $12.00. 

So, Roy has saved $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

The final answer is: $42.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain in relation to Pompei's lifting capacity. 

First, we know that Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, and Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. So, Saskay can lift a mountain 12 * 1 = 12 inches.

Next, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Finally, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 since there are 12 inches in a foot. 

480 / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total distance traveled by Mason, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours, and then add them together.

Distance = Speed x Time

For the first 4 hours:
Distance = 8 miles/hour x 4 hours = 32 miles

For the next 6 hours:
Distance = 8 miles/hour x 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the time it takes for one kangaroo to travel across the highway. Since three kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, one kangaroo would take three times as long, which is 18 * 3 = 54 hours.

Now, we know that the turtles travel at half the speed of a kangaroo. Since speed is inversely proportional to time, if the turtles travel at half the speed, they will take twice as long to cover the same distance. 

So, if one kangaroo takes 54 hours, the time it takes for one turtle to travel across the highway would be 54 * 2 = 108 hours. 

Since there are four turtles, and they are traveling at the same speed, the total time it will take for all four turtles to travel across the highway is 108 * 4 = 432 hours.

The final answer is: 432"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Kora made 20 dishes. 
Rory made 20 more clay dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes. 
Jada made twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

To find the total number of clay dishes they all made together, we need to add the number of dishes each person made. 
Total = Kora's dishes + Rory's dishes + Jada's dishes 
Total = 20 + 40 + 80 
Total = 140

The final answer is: 140"
"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has after receiving her payment and her mom's contribution.

First, let's calculate the price of the new laptop after trading in her old one: $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom is giving her $80, so she receives a total of $150 + $80 = $230.

Since Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, we can set up an equation to represent the situation: 

Let x be the amount of money Erika has in her purse. Then, x + $230 = $400 + $50.

Simplifying the equation, we get x + $230 = $450.

Subtracting $230 from both sides of the equation, we get x = $220.

So, Erika has $220 in her purse.

"To find out how many slices Adam has left, we first need to calculate the total number of slices he has. 

3 large apples can be sliced into 3 * 5 = 15 slices. 
5 small apples can be sliced into 5 * 3 = 15 slices. 

In total, Adam has 15 + 15 = 30 slices. 

Since Adam eats 15 slices, we subtract the number of slices he ate from the total number of slices: 
30 - 15 = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the total amount of milk the farmer currently produces. 

The farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each cow, and he has 3 cows. So, the total amount of milk he currently produces is 5 liters/cow * 3 cows = 15 liters/day.

To find out how many more cows he needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we subtract the current production from the target production: 25 liters/day - 15 liters/day = 10 liters/day.

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we need to find out how many cows are needed to produce 10 liters of milk a day. We can do this by dividing the target production by the milk production per cow: 10 liters/day / 5 liters/cow = 2 cows.

The farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the length of each used portion and subtract it from the original length of the glue stick.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so the used portion is 1 - 1/6 = 5/6. The length of the used portion is 5/6 * 12 mm = 10 mm.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so the used portion is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. The length of the used portion is 1/3 * 12 mm = 4 mm.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so the used portion is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. The length of the used portion is 1/2 * 12 mm = 6 mm.

Now, let's calculate the total length of the used portions: 10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm.

The total length of the glue sticks is 3 * 12 mm = 36 mm.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 36 mm - 20 mm = 16 mm.

The final answer is: 16"

The total cost of the items is $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10080.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200, so he has a total of $5000 + $200 = $5200.

Now, let's subtract the amount of money Gabriel has from the total cost of the items: $10080 - $5200 = $3580.

So, Gabriel still needs $3580."

"To find out how much money Craig has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract that from the initial amount he had.

Craig initially had 2 twenty-dollar bills, which is 2 * $20 = $40.

He bought 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so the total cost of the squirt guns is 6 * $2 = $12.

He also bought 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so the total cost of the water balloons is 3 * $3 = $9.

The total amount he spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

Craig has $19 left.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so the number of socks Jack has is 60 / 2 = 30.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 2 * 30 = 60 socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90
Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 90 + 90 = 180."
"To find the number of students good at math, we need to consider the total number of students and the number of students good at both subjects. 

Let's denote the number of students good at both math and English as x. We know that the total number of students is 20, and the number of students good at math only is 5, and the number of students good at English only is 8.

We can set up the equation: 5 (math only) + 8 (English only) + x (both) = 20 (total)

Simplifying the equation, we get: 13 + x = 20

Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get: x = 7

However, we are asked to find the number of students good at math. Since x represents the number of students good at both subjects, we need to add the number of students good at math only (5) to x to get the total number of students good at math.

So, the number of students good at math is 5 (math only) + 7 (both) = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many groups can perform, we need to calculate the total available time for performances. 

The concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes. Subtracting the 10-minute intermission, we have 120 - 10 = 110 minutes available for performances.

Each group takes 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage. So, the total time taken by each group is 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes.

Now, we can divide the total available time for performances (110 minutes) by the time taken by each group (10 minutes) to find out how many groups can perform.

110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups

"To solve this problem, we need to understand that it's a simple interest scenario. The interest rate is 3/4 of the original amount per year, which can be expressed as 0.75 or 75% of the principal amount.

The formula for simple interest is: A = P(1 + rt), where A is the total amount, P is the principal amount, r is the interest rate, and t is the time period in years.

Given that the principal amount (P) is $300, the interest rate (r) is 0.75, and the time period (t) is 3 years, we can plug these values into the formula:

A = 300(1 + 0.75*3)
A = 300(1 + 2.25)
A = 300(3.25)
A = 975

The total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $975.

The final answer is: $975"

To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we need to find the total number of floral shirts and subtract the number of floral shirts with buttons.

Total floral shirts = 50
Floral shirts with buttons = 20
Floral shirts with no buttons = 50 - 20 = 30

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars.

Difference = Floral shirts with no buttons - White shirts with no collars
= 30 - 20
= 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much the farmer will earn, we need to determine how many trays he can fill with 900 eggs. 

Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray to find the number of trays:

900 eggs / 30 eggs per tray = 30 trays

Now, we can multiply the number of trays by the price per tray to find the total earnings:

30 trays * $2.5 per tray = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we first need to determine how many goats were sold from each farm. 

From Farm X, Mr. Smith sold 10 goats. 
From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as from Farm X, which is 2 * 10 = 20 goats.

Now, let's calculate the number of goats left in each farm. 
In Farm X, he had 55 goats initially and sold 10, so he has 55 - 10 = 45 goats left.
In Farm Y, he had 45 goats initially and sold 20, so he has 45 - 20 = 25 goats left.

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the number of goats left in each farm: 45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount spent on shoes per year by the number of pairs bought per year.

First, let's calculate the number of pairs James buys per year. Since he buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, and there are 12 months in a year, he buys 2 * 12 = 24 pairs of shoes per year.

Now, let's divide the total amount spent on shoes per year ($2640) by the number of pairs bought per year (24):

$2640 ÷ 24 = $110

So, James pays an average of $110 per pair of shoes."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food, then subtract the discount for the red baskets.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $18 = $54.

The total cost before discount is $75 + $54 = $129.

Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, the total discount is 3 * $2 = $6.

The total cost after discount is $129 - $6 = $123.

The final numerical answer is: $123"
"To find the time it takes to clean one-half of the rooms, we first need to determine the number of rooms that is half of 90. 

90 / 2 = 45 rooms

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room.

45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

The final numerical answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built each year and then add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years, which is 12 + 36 = 48 homes. Then, they will double this amount, so 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's add the number of homes built each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes.

The total number of homes built over the next three years is 144.

144"
"Let's denote my age as A, my brother's age as B, and my sister's age as C. 

Since I am three years younger than my brother, A = B - 3. 
I am 2 years older than my sister, so A = C + 2. 
My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so my mom's age = 3B - 1. 

The sum of all our ages is 87, so A + B + C + (3B - 1) = 87. 

Substituting A = B - 3 and A = C + 2 into the equation, we get (B - 3) + B + C + (3B - 1) = 87. 
Combine like terms: 5B + C - 4 = 87. 

Now, substitute A = C + 2 into the equation A = B - 3: C + 2 = B - 3. 
Rearrange the equation to get C = B - 5. 

Substitute C = B - 5 into the equation 5B + C - 4 = 87: 5B + (B - 5) - 4 = 87. 
Combine like terms: 6B - 9 = 87. 
Add 9 to both sides: 6B = 96. 
Divide by 6: B = 16. 

Now that we have B, we can find C: C = B - 5 = 16 - 5 = 11. 
And we can find A: A = C + 2 = 11 + 2 = 13. 

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs, we first need to determine the total number of glue sticks required. Since each student needs 2 glue sticks and there are 27 students, the total number of glue sticks needed is 27 * 2 = 54.

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by the number of glue sticks per pack to find out how many packs are needed. However, since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and expects to have some extra glue sticks left over, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

To do this, we can divide 54 by 8, which gives us 6.75. Since we can't buy a fraction of a pack, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 7.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at the given point over the three days.

On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point over the three days, we need to add the amounts from each day: 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000 gallons.

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 24000 gallons.

The final answer is: 24000"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. Since each infected person infects six others, we can model the growth of the infected population using a geometric progression.

Let's denote the initial number of infected people as P0 = 10. The number of new infections each day can be calculated as 6 times the number of infected people from the previous day.

Day 1: P1 = P0 + 6P0 = 10 + 6(10) = 10 + 60 = 70
Day 2: P2 = P1 + 6P1 = 70 + 6(70) = 70 + 420 = 490
Day 3: P3 = P2 + 6P2 = 490 + 6(490) = 490 + 2940 = 3430

Therefore, the total number of people infected after three days is 3430.

The final answer is: 3430"
"To find out how much money Julieta received, we need to calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips and subtract that from Rafaela's total tips. 

Rafaela received 40 * $20 = $800 in tips. 

10% of $800 is 0.1 * $800 = $80. 

So, Julieta received $800 - $80 = $720 in tips.

Now, to find the total amount of money they received altogether, we add Rafaela's and Julieta's tips: $800 + $720 = $1520.

The final answer is: $1520"
"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to calculate the total number of oranges given to her children. 

She gave her three daughters 2 oranges each, so 3 daughters * 2 oranges = 6 oranges. 
Her only boy got 3 oranges. 
So, the total number of oranges given to her children is 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges initially. 
To find out how many oranges she remained with, we subtract the total number of oranges given to her children from the initial number of oranges. 
12 (initial oranges) - 9 (oranges given to children) = 3 oranges.

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Claire earns 1 badge per month.
- Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.
- Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), the number of badges earned by each girl is as follows:

- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 1/2 badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:

36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much Paige raised, we first need to determine the total number of slices she baked. 

Since Paige bakes 2 loaves per hour and she baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, we need to find out how many hours she baked. 6:00 PM - 1:00 PM = 5 hours. 

In 5 hours, she bakes 2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 10 loaves. 

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, so we need to convert the total number of slices into dollars. 80 slices * 0.50 dollars/slice = 40 dollars.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we first need to determine the number of silver coins she has. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, and she has 70 gold coins, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship.

Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Then, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'. We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 70

To solve for 'x', we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

x = 70 - 30
x = 40

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. To find the total number of coins, we add the number of silver coins to the number of gold coins:

Total coins = Number of silver coins + Number of gold coins
Total coins = 40 + 70
Total coins = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we first need to determine the total number of burritos consumed. 

There were 50 students at the picnic, and each student was given 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Mr. George also ate 20 burritos. 

The total number of burritos consumed is 500 (given to students) + 20 (eaten by Mr. George) = 520.

Since there were 600 burritos ordered initially, the total number of leftover burritos is 600 - 520 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the number of yellow cars, we first need to determine the number of green and blue cars. 

We know there are 12 red cars. The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we know the total number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52.

Since the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S. 

We are given that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so S = A + 25. 

We are also given that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so A = F - 12.

We can substitute the second equation into the first one to get S = (F - 12) + 25, which simplifies to S = F + 13.

We are also given that together, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books, so S + A + F = 85. 

Substituting the expressions for S and A in terms of F into this equation, we get (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85.

Combining like terms, we get 3F + 1 = 85.

Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get 3F = 84.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get F = 28.

The final answer is: 28"
"To find the weight of the carrots, we first need to determine the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

Next, we need to find the weight of the carrots. The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the weight of the carrots is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The weight of the carrots is 7 pounds."
"To find out how much Greg will spend on Jello, we first need to determine how many Jello cups he needs to buy. Since there will be 30 kids and each kid will have 4 Jello cups, we multiply the number of kids by the number of cups per kid: 30 kids * 4 cups/kid = 120 cups.

Since one 3-ounce box of Jello makes 10 small Jello cups, we need to find out how many boxes Greg needs to buy. We divide the total number of cups needed by the number of cups per box: 120 cups / 10 cups/box = 12 boxes.

Now, we need to find out how much Greg will spend on Jello. Each box costs $1.25, so we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box: 12 boxes * $1.25/box = $15.

"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to determine how much Keenan spends in a month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

First, let's calculate Keenan's monthly expenditure: 
40% of $400 = 0.4 * $400 = $160

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can find out how much Keenan spends per week by dividing his monthly expenditure by 4:
$160 / 4 = $40

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he ate on each day and add them up.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and divide by 5:
60 * 2 = 120
120 / 5 = 24

So, on the first day, he ate 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. To find the remaining pieces after the first two days, we subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26

Now, we need to find 7/13 of 26:
26 * 7 = 182
182 / 13 = 14.15 (round to 14, since you can't eat a fraction of a piece)

So, on the third day, he ate 14 pieces.

Now, let's add up the pieces eaten on each day:
24 (first day) + 10 (second day) + 14 (third day) = 48

"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we first need to determine the cost per bottle of soda and the cost per bottle of water.

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so the cost per bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00 per bottle.

The cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the cost per bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00 per bottle.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:

Cost of 3 bottles of soda = 3 * $3.00 = $9.00
Cost of 2 bottles of water = 2 * $2.00 = $4.00
Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

"To find out how much money David has left after buying the bolts, we need to calculate the total cost of the bolts and subtract that from the initial amount of money he has.

The cost of each bolt is $0.03, and David wants to buy 16 bolts. 

Total cost of bolts = Number of bolts * Cost per bolt
Total cost of bolts = 16 * $0.03
Total cost of bolts = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost of the bolts from the initial amount of money David has:

Initial amount of money = $12.48
Total cost of bolts = $0.48
Money left = Initial amount of money - Total cost of bolts
Money left = $12.48 - $0.48
Money left = $12.00

We know that Ella earned $33 for 3 hours of dog walking. To find her hourly rate, we can divide the total amount earned by the number of hours worked.

Hourly rate = Total amount earned / Number of hours worked
Hourly rate = $33 / 3 hours
Hourly rate = $11 per hour

Now that we know her hourly rate, we can calculate how much she would earn after 12 hours of dog walking.

"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points she gets from each type of question and add them together.

First, let's calculate the points from the multiple-choice questions. Amy correctly answers 80% of the 10 multiple-choice questions, so she gets 0.8 * 10 = 8 points from the multiple-choice questions.

Next, let's calculate the points from the true/false questions. Amy correctly answers 90% of the 20 true/false questions, so she gets 0.9 * 20 = 18 points from the true/false questions.

Now, let's calculate the points from the long-answer questions. Amy correctly answers 60% of the 5 long-answer questions, so she gets 0.6 * 5 = 3 points from the long-answer questions.

Finally, we multiply the points from each type of question by their respective point values and add them together. The multiple-choice questions are worth 1 point each, the true/false questions are worth 1 point each, and the long-answer questions are worth 5 points each. So, we get:

"To find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we first need to determine how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them, we can calculate the number of chickens he plans to sell as follows:

Number of chickens to sell = 300 * (3/5)
= 300 * 0.6
= 180 chickens

Now, we know that Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000 by selling these chickens at $50 each. To find the total revenue, we multiply the number of chickens by the selling price:

Total revenue = Number of chickens to sell * Selling price
= 180 * $50
= $9000

Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, we can set up the equation:

Total revenue - Total cost = Profit
$9000 - Total cost = $2000

To find the total cost, we subtract the profit from the total revenue:

Total cost = Total revenue - Profit
= $9000 - $2000
= $7000

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"

"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope, we need to calculate the total amount of money she gets from selling the rope and then subtract the cost of the new rope.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Sarah gets from selling the rope. The rope is 20 meters long, and her friend is buying it for $2 a meter. 

Total money from selling the rope = Length of rope * Price per meter
Total money from selling the rope = 20 * $2
Total money from selling the rope = $40

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 a meter, and Sarah wants to buy a rope of the same length (20 meters).

Cost of the new rope = Length of rope * Price per meter
Cost of the new rope = 20 * $1.5

Current age = 18 - 10 = 8 years

Now, we need to find the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her current age. Let's call this number 'x'. We can set up the equation:

Age after x years = 3 * Current age
8 + x = 3 * 8

Simplifying the equation:
8 + x = 24

Subtracting 8 from both sides:
x = 16

So, it will take 16 years for Melanie's age to be thrice her current age.

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's find the cost of the chicken. Since each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and the 5 packs of bacon cost $10, the cost of one pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2. Therefore, the cost of one pack of chicken is $2 * 2 = $4. Since Kelly has 6 packs of chicken, the total cost of the chicken is 6 * $4 = $24.

Next, let's find the cost of the strawberries. Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of the strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

Now, let's find the cost of the apples. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. Since Kelly has 7 packs of apples, the total cost of the apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Finally, let's subtract the total cost of the items from Kelly's budget: $65 - $60 = $5.

However, we know that the singer has 50 microphones in total. Since 20% of the microphones won't find any space to fit in, the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is 80% of 50, which is 0.8 * 50 = 40.

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged is 40 / 2 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate the number of birds in each group and add them together.

First, let's find the number of birds flying overhead. Since 2/3 of the birds in the bushes are flying overhead, we multiply the number of birds in the bushes by 2/3.

Number of birds in the bushes: 6
Number of birds flying overhead: 6 * (2/3) = 4

Next, let's find the number of birds feeding. There are 3 groups of 8 birds each, so we multiply the number of groups by the number of birds per group.

Number of birds feeding: 3 * 8 = 24

Now, we add the number of birds in the bushes, flying overhead, and feeding to find the total number of birds.

Total number of birds: 6 + 4 + 24 = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to subtract the cookies Lani ate from the total number of cookies and then divide the result by the number of jars.

First, let's subtract the cookies Lani ate: 55 - 5 = 50 cookies.

Next, we divide the remaining cookies by the number of jars: 50 / 5 = 10 cookies per jar.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of petals on the orchids, we multiply the number of orchids by the number of petals per orchid: 5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals.

To find the total number of petals on the daisies, we multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals.

Now, we subtract the total number of orchid petals from the total number of daisy petals to find the difference: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

The daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids. 

15"
"To find the percentage of flowering plants, we first need to determine the number of flowering plants. 

There are 100 plants in total. One-fourth of them are indoor plants, which is 100 * (1/4) = 25 plants. 

The remaining plants are 100 - 25 = 75 plants. Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants, which is 75 * (2/3) = 50 plants. 

The rest of the remaining plants are flowering plants, which is 75 - 50 = 25 plants.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25 / 100) * 100 = 25%.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to determine the speed of the thingamabob first. Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can find the speed of the thingamabob by dividing the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11.

Speed of thingamabob = Speed of whatchamacallit / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig by multiplying the speed of the thingamabob by 5.

Speed of whirligig = Speed of thingamabob * 5
Speed of whirligig = 11 * 5
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

The final answer is: 55"
"Let's break down the information given. Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price of the salad. 

Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of the salad and the yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9. 

Since Ellen pays a total of $11 for her daily goods, and the salad and yogurt cost $9, the cost of two carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.

To find the cost of one carrot, we divide the cost of two carrots by 2. So, the cost of one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark used to make $10 an hour, but his pay was raised by $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we can multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week to find his weekly earnings: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, the number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn is 3x. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's, so the number of times she mowed Alba's lawn is 5x.

The total number of lawns she mowed is x (Joe's) + 3x (Kamala's) + 5x (Alba's) = 9x.

We know that she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn. Since she mowed 9x lawns in total, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 9x * 6 = 54x.

We also know that she made a total of $80 from both lemonade sales and mowing lawns. So, the amount she made from lemonade sales is 80 - 54x.

Since we don't know the value of x, we need to find a way to determine it. However, we can use the fact that she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn. This means that 6 = 6x, which implies x = 1.

Now that we know x = 1, we can find the amount she made from lemonade sales: 80 - 54x = 80 - 54(1) = 80 - 54 = 26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To find Harry's weight, we need to calculate the weights of Carl and Christian first. 

Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, which is 55 kg. So, Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.

Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, which is 71 kg. So, Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.

Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, which is 79 kg. So, Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

The final answer is: 74"
"To find the total amount John earns from renting his car, we need to calculate the total hours he rents his car and multiply it by his hourly rate.

He rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so the total hours he rents his car is 10 * 3 = 30 hours.

His hourly rate is $25, so the total amount he earns is 30 * $25 = $750.

To find the profit, we need to subtract his car payment from the total amount he earns. 

Profit = Total earnings - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500
Profit = $250

The final answer is: $250"
"Let's break down the information given. Martha initially had some notebooks, but we don't know the exact number. However, we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha. 

Let's denote the number of notebooks Martha had initially as 'x'. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, Joseph had 3x notebooks.

Martha bought 5 more notebooks, and now she has a total of 7 notebooks. This means that the initial number of notebooks she had (x) plus the 5 she bought equals 7. So, we can write the equation as x + 5 = 7.

To find the value of x, we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation: x = 7 - 5, which gives us x = 2. 

Now that we know Martha had 2 notebooks initially, we can find out how many notebooks Joseph had. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has: 7 - 6 = 1.

"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we first need to determine the distance rowed by Anis. 

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find 1/5 of Dijana's distance, we multiply 50 by 1/5, which is 10 miles. 

So, Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles. 

Now, to find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we add their individual distances: 50 (Dijana) + 60 (Anis) = 110 miles.

The final answer is: 110"
"To find out how many cookies each of Susan's nephews will get, we first need to determine the total number of cookies left after her husband took some. 

Initially, Susan had 100 cookies. Her husband took 4 cookies, so we subtract 4 from 100 to get the remaining cookies: 100 - 4 = 96.

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews, which is 6. 

To do this, we divide 96 by 6: 96 ÷ 6 = 16.

So, each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more than as many pages as Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 5 + 13 = 18 pages today.

So, Denise's total pages read is 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.

Daniel's total pages read is 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages.

The difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel is 28 - 13 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of bowls that can be filled with the leftover soup and then divide that by the number of child-sized bowls.

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls, and there are 3 adults (Calvin, his wife, and himself), the total number of adult bowls that can be filled is 3. 

Since 4 adult bowls equal 8 child bowls, we can set up a proportion to find the number of child bowls that can be filled: 4 adult bowls = 8 child bowls. 

To find the number of child bowls that can be filled, we can multiply the number of adult bowls by 2 (since 4 adult bowls equal 8 child bowls): 3 adult bowls * 2 = 6 child bowls.

Now, we know that there are 6 child bowls that can be filled with the leftover soup. Since there are 2 children, we can divide the total number of child bowls by 2 to find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch: 6 child bowls / 2 children = 3.

"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to calculate the total amount of material required for small and large masks separately and then add them together.

For small masks, Jo needs 2 yards of material per 4 masks. To make 20 small masks, she would need:
20 small masks / 4 small masks per 2 yards = 5 sets of 4 small masks
Since each set requires 2 yards, she would need 5 * 2 = 10 yards for small masks.

For large masks, Jo needs 2.25 yards of material per 3 masks. To make 8 large masks, she would need:
8 large masks / 3 large masks per 2.25 yards = 2.67 sets of 3 large masks (approximately)
Since each set requires 2.25 yards, she would need 2.67 * 2.25 = 6 yards for large masks.

Now, let's add the material needed for small and large masks together:
10 yards (small masks) + 6 yards (large masks) = 16 yards

"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to first find the total number of tickets she bought and the total amount she spent. 

Since Deepa saw each of the 9 movies three times, the total number of tickets she bought is 9 movies * 3 showings per movie = 27 tickets.

The total amount she spent is given as $216.

To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets: $216 / 27 tickets.

Average price per ticket = $216 / 27 tickets = $8.

"To find out how much free time Harold has left in his day, we need to calculate the total hours in a day, subtract the hours he sleeps, works, and walks his dog.

There are 24 hours in a day. 

Harold sleeps for 10 hours, so he has 24 - 10 = 14 hours left.

He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours. 

He walks his dog for 1 hour.

Now, let's subtract the hours he sleeps, works, and walks his dog from the total hours in a day: 24 - 10 - 8 - 1 = 5 hours.

So, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day.

"To find out how many red shoeboxes Tim used, we need to calculate 1/3 of 9. 

1/3 of 9 is 9 / 3 = 3.

So, Tim used 3 red shoeboxes. 

Now, let's find out how many red shoeboxes are left. 
9 (initial red shoeboxes) - 3 (used red shoeboxes) = 6.

Tim used 3 blue shoeboxes. 
So, the number of blue shoeboxes left is 7 (initial blue shoeboxes) - 3 (used blue shoeboxes) = 4.

Therefore, the number of red shoeboxes left is 6 and the number of blue shoeboxes left is 4.

18 - 2 = 16

Joseph currently has 16 books. 

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we first need to determine how many marbles he gave away in total. 

Dean gives 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie. Since he has 30 marbles, we can calculate 1/5 of 30 as follows: 30 * (1/5) = 6. So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie.

In addition to giving 6 marbles to Jamie, Dean also gives 10 marbles to Donald. So, the total number of marbles given away is 6 + 10 = 16.

Now, we subtract the total number of marbles given away from the initial number of marbles Dean had: 30 - 16 = 14.

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write an equation:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 2 * Adam's age four years ago
Duncan's age eight years ago = 2x

We know that Duncan's current age is 60, so we can find his age eight years ago by subtracting 8 from 60:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 60 - 8
Duncan's age eight years ago = 52

Now we can equate this to 2x:

52 = 2x

To find x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 52 / 2
x = 26

This means Adam's age four years ago was 26. To find Adam's current age, we add 4 to x:

Adam's current age = x + 4
Adam's current age = 26 + 4
Adam's current age = 30

Finally, to find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = Adam's current age + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 38

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that. 

Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is 2 * 200 = 400 acres. 

100 acres more than that is 400 + 100 = 500 acres. 

So, Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres. 

Now, we add the size of both farms to find the total: 200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The final answer is: 700"
"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to first determine how many packages he completes in that time. 

Since he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, we can express this as an equation: 
Packages per hour = 50 - 10
Packages per hour = 40

Now, we need to find out how many packages he completes in 8 hours. 
Packages per 8 hours = Packages per hour * 8
Packages per 8 hours = 40 * 8
Packages per 8 hours = 320

Now, we know that Colby gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes.

"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the time it takes to solve the extreme sudoku and then divide it by the time it takes to drink one bottle of water.

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so the time to solve an extreme sudoku is 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to convert the time to solve the extreme sudoku to hours and then divide by 0.5 (since there are 2 half hours in an hour). 

180 minutes is equal to 3 hours. 

Now, we divide 3 hours by 0.5 to get the number of half hours, which is 6. 

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, he drinks 6 bottles of water in 3 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the red balloons and then subtract that from the total number of bologna pieces to find out how many were thrown at the yellow balloons.

Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and there are 20 red balloons, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

Now, we know that Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna at the bundle of balloons. To find out how many pieces were thrown at the yellow balloons, we subtract the number of pieces thrown at the red balloons from the total: 58 - 40 = 18.

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we can find the number of yellow balloons by dividing the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons by 3: 18 / 3 = 6.

First, let's find the cost of the balloons. 1 dozen balloons is equal to 12 balloons. Since 2 balloons cost $0.5, 12 balloons will cost 12 * $0.5 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of the cake and the balloons is $11 + $3 = $14.

The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is $7 * 2 = $14.

The total cost of the cake, balloons, and ice cream is $14 + $14 = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine used all the money they had to buy these items, the total amount of money they had is $28.

Since they had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount of money by 2 to find out how much each of them received.

"To find the total profit made by the class, we need to first find the total number of lollipops sold and the total cost of the lollipops.

Each student sold 10 lollipops, and there are 30 students. So, the total number of lollipops sold is:
10 lollipops/student * 30 students = 300 lollipops

The cost of each lollipop is $0.5, and the selling price is $0.8. The profit per lollipop is the difference between the selling price and the cost:
Profit per lollipop = $0.8 - $0.5 = $0.3

Now, we can find the total profit by multiplying the profit per lollipop by the total number of lollipops sold:
Total profit = Profit per lollipop * Total number of lollipops
Total profit = $0.3 * 300
Total profit = $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cups of tea are in each row. Since Lana divides the 27 cups into 3 rows, we can divide 27 by 3 to get the number of cups in each row.

27 cups / 3 rows = 9 cups per row

Since Lana creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row will be half of the total cups in each row.

9 cups per row / 2 = 4.5 cups of mint tea per row

However, since we can't have a fraction of a cup, we can assume that Lana will make whole cups of tea. This means that she will make 4 cups of mint tea in each row and 5 cups of chamomile tea in each row, as the total number of cups in each row is 9.

4 cups of mint tea per row"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip. 

Let's break down the information given:

- The sloth takes 4 hours to make a round trip (down and back up) to collect berries.
- The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

Since the sloth takes 4 hours for a round trip, in 8 hours, he can make 8 / 4 = 2 round trips.

If he makes 2 round trips, he will collect a total of 2 * x berries, where x is the number of berries he picks up per trip.

We want to find the minimum value of x such that 2 * x = 24.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 12.

So, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is 12.

Next, we need to find out how much water is used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so over 6 days, the total water used is:

500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons

Now, we subtract the water used from the initial amount in the tank to find the remaining water:

- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

"To find the total calories of the pastries, we first need to calculate the calories of each type of mini pastry. 

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories. 

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, we can calculate the total calories of each type of pastry. 
200 mini cinnamon rolls have 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.
300 mini blueberry muffins have 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

The total calories of the pastries are 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

The final answer is: 85000"
"To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed and then divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, so 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Tuesday, so 2 * 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378

There are 5 days in total. 

Average number of Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days
= 378 / 5
= 75.6

The final answer is: 75.6"
"To find out how far each vehicle traveled, we need to multiply their speeds by the time they traveled.

The bus traveled 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it covered is 60 * 5 = 300 miles.

The car traveled 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it covered is 30 * 8 = 240 miles.

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus. 

300 - 240 = 60 miles.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls from the total number of toys she has now.

The total number of toys before buying the bouncy balls is the sum of the blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings. 

Total toys before = 31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48

Now, we subtract this total from the total number of toys after buying the bouncy balls to find the number of bouncy balls.

Number of bouncy balls = Total toys after - Total toys before
= 62 - 48
= 14

The final answer is: 14"
"Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as Pp, and John's age as J. 

We are given that Pp = J + 10. 

We are also given that P = Pp + J.

We are also given that P + Pp + J = 100.

Substituting Pp from the first equation into the second equation, we get P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10.

Substituting P and Pp into the third equation, we get (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100.

Combine like terms: 4J + 20 = 100.

Subtract 20 from both sides: 4J = 80.

Divide both sides by 4: J = 20.

Now that we know J, we can find Pp: Pp = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30.

Now that we know Pp, we can find P: P = Pp + J = 30 + 20 = 50.

"To find the total number of balloons, we first need to calculate the initial number of balloons each person had and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria and her 4 friends each had 2 water balloons. So, the total number of balloons initially is 5 people * 2 balloons/person = 10 balloons.

Maria's mom then gave each person 3 more balloons. So, the total number of additional balloons is 5 people * 3 balloons/person = 15 balloons.

The total number of balloons is the sum of the initial and additional balloons: 10 balloons + 15 balloons = 25 balloons.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many tables they need, we first need to calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have. 

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so they have 10 * 5 = 50 boxes from donations. 
They already have 10 boxes, so the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, they will need 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

They already own 15 tables, so they need 30 - 15 = 15 more tables.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance spat by each person and then divide it by the total number of seeds spat.

Zoey spits 40 seeds, each 10 feet, so the total distance spat by Zoey is 40 * 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney spits 35 seeds, each 12 feet, so the total distance spat by Sydney is 35 * 12 = 420 feet.

The total distance spat by both is 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

The total number of seeds spat is 40 + 35 = 75.

The average total distance spat is 820 / 75 = 10.93 (rounded to two decimal places).

The final answer is: 10.93"
"To determine which widget maker is more profitable, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month and then multiply that by the price of each widget.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month. The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour and runs 24 hours a day. 

60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1440 widgets/day
1440 widgets/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets/month

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour and runs 24 hours a day.

45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1080 widgets/day
1080 widgets/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets/month

Now, let's calculate the total revenue for each machine. Each widget sells for $6.

Widgeteer 3000 revenue: 43,200 widgets/month * $6/widget = $259,200/month
WidgetMaster 9000 revenue: 32,400 widgets/month * $6/widget = $194,400/month

To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we subtract the revenue of the WidgetMaster 9000 from the revenue of the Widgeteer 3000.

$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

The final answer is: $64,800"
"To find out how much Cameron would save, we first need to calculate the cost of his stay with the option of adding on 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark and then compare it to the cost of paying for a 24-hour stay.

Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. Since the first 12 hours are already included in the initial charge, we need to calculate the cost of the additional 5 hours.

The cost of the additional 5 hours is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.

The total cost of Cameron's stay with the option of adding on 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

The cost of paying for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of his chosen option from the cost of paying for a 24-hour stay: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final answer is: $250"
"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to calculate the amount each sheep needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Each goat needs 5 pounds, so twice that amount is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds. 
3 pounds less than 10 pounds is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately:

For the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds
For the sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

To find the total amount of hay needed, we add the amount needed for the goats and the sheep:

75 pounds (goats) + 84 pounds (sheep) = 159 pounds

The final answer is: 159"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate John's total earnings, subtract his expenses, and then determine how much money he has left to spend on pens and pencils.

First, let's calculate John's total earnings: 
50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the pencils: 
5 pencils * 10 dollars/pencil = 50 dollars

Now, let's subtract John's gas expenses and the cost of the pencils from his total earnings: 
300 dollars - 50 dollars - 50 dollars = 200 dollars

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we need to subtract that from his remaining money: 
200 dollars - 100 dollars = 100 dollars

Finally, let's calculate how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining money: 
100 dollars / 25 dollars = 4

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we first need to determine the total number of bottles she has initially and then subtract the number of bottles given to the students.

The teacher has 9 coupons, each redeemable for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles she has initially is 9 * 100 = 900 bottles.

Each of the 29 students gets 2 bottles of apple juice, so the total number of bottles given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58 bottles.

To find out how many bottles the teacher has left, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles she initially had: 900 - 58 = 842.

"To find the total amount Patty charged, we need to calculate the labor cost and add it to the cost of parts and the initial visit fee.

The labor cost is $35 per hour, and the job took 2.25 hours. Since the labor is charged per hour or part thereof, we need to round up to the nearest hour for the labor cost. However, in this case, 2.25 hours is less than 3 hours, so we can simply multiply 2.25 hours by $35 per hour.

Labor cost = 2.25 hours * $35 per hour = $78.75

The cost of parts is $60.

The initial visit fee is $40.

Total cost = Labor cost + Cost of parts + Initial visit fee
Total cost = $78.75 + $60 + $40
Total cost = $178.75

"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we first need to calculate the original price of the CDs and then subtract the discount. 

The original price of 10 CDs is 10 * $15 = $150. 

Since James gets a 40% discount, we need to find 40% of $150. 
40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price: $150 - $60 = $90.

James spent $90 on the CDs.

Next, we need to find out how much he got back from selling 5 CDs. 
He sold them for $40 each, so 5 * $40 = $200.

Now, we subtract the amount he got back from the amount he spent: $90 - $200 = -$110.

However, since James can't be out by a negative amount, we need to re-evaluate the situation. 

James spent $90 on the CDs and got $200 back from selling 5 of them. This means he actually made a profit of $110.

But the question asks how much money he was out, which implies he lost money. Since he made a profit, we need to consider the CDs he didn't sell. 

The original price of 10 CDs is $150, and he sold 5 for $200. The remaining 5 CDs are worth $150 - $200 = -$50. However, since he can't be out by a negative amount, we need to re-evaluate the situation.

James spent $90 on the CDs and got $200 back from selling 5 of them. This means he has 5 CDs left that he didn't sell. The original price of these 5 CDs is $75. 

Since he didn't sell them, he still owns them, and we need to consider the cost of these 5 CDs. 

The cost of the 5 CDs he didn't sell is $75. 

The final amount James was out is the cost of the 5 CDs he didn't sell: $75.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's calculate the time James took to swim 60% of the distance. The total distance is 20 miles, and 60% of that is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. 

Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

After swimming, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, let's calculate the remaining distance. The total distance is 20 miles, and James has already swum 12 miles, so the remaining distance is 20 - 12 = 8 miles.

James then swims the remaining distance at half his original speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. The time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

The total time taken is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time taken to swim the remaining distance. So, the total time is 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

The final answer is: 17"

- Commission rate: 10%
- Commission per copy: 10% of $5 = 0.1 * $5 = $0.5
- Total commission from New York Times: 6 * $0.5 = $3

Commission from Wall Street Journal:
- Number of copies sold: 10
- Price per copy: $15
- Commission rate: 8%
- Commission per copy: 8% of $15 = 0.08 * $15 = $1.2

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Bahati and Dinar. 

Let's denote the points scored by Dinar as 'x'. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati's points can be represented as 'x + 10'. 

We also know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Azibo's points can be represented as '(x + 10) - 20' or 'x - 10'.

The total points scored by the team is 45, which is the sum of the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar. We can write this as an equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x - 10) = 45

Combine like terms:

3x = 45

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 15

Now that we know Dinar scored 15 points, we can find Azibo's points by subtracting 10 from Bahati's points. However, we first need to find Bahati's points. Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, and we know Dinar scored 15 points, we can represent Bahati's points as '15 + 20' or '35'. 

Azibo's points can be found by subtracting 20 from Bahati's points: 35 - 20 = 15.

However, we know that Azibo's points can also be represented as 'x - 10'. Since we found that x = 15, we can confirm that Azibo's points are indeed 15 - 10 = 5.

The points scored by Azibo is 5.

"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book in inches.

Since each paper is 100 pages to the inch and each paper is printed on both sides, we have 200 pages per inch (100 pages per side).

Given that the book is 1.5 inches thick, we can multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book:

200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 300 pages

"To find the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total time he spent stapling reports and then multiply it by his stapling rate.

First, let's find the total time in minutes. Vince stapled reports from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. 

15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many sets of 15 minutes are in 900 minutes, we divide 900 by 15.

900 minutes / 15 minutes = 60 sets

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we multiply the number of sets by his stapling rate.

60 sets * 30 reports/set = 1800 reports

So, Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether.

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. This is a total of 8 hours, which is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m. This means she slept for 5:55 a.m. - 10 p.m. = 7 hours and 55 minutes, which is 7 * 60 + 55 = 455 minutes.

She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

To find the total sleep time, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking from the total sleep time: 455 - 23 = 432 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. 

Since Jonathan has two dozen cups, and one dozen is equal to 12, he has 2 * 12 = 24 measuring cups.

It is given that Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. So, the number of measuring spoons he has is 2/3 * 24 = 16.

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons.

Now, to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we need to add the number of measuring cups and measuring spoons he has left. 

Total number of utensils = 24 (measuring cups) + 10 (measuring spoons) = 34

"To find the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we first need to calculate the number of occupied beds and then subtract that from the total capacity.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied. 

1/5 of 1000 is 100. So, the number of occupied beds is 100.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we need to calculate the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 14 days.

The total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks is 50 * 14 = 700.

Now, we add the initial occupied beds to the total number of patients admitted: 100 + 700 = 800.

The number of unoccupied beds is the total capacity minus the occupied beds: 1000 - 800 = 200.

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 200."
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we first need to determine the number of non-work emails she sends. 

She sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to her family. Two-thirds of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6. This means she sends 6 emails to her family.

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after sending to her family. Since she sends 6 emails to her family, the remaining emails are 9 - 6 = 3.

One-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend. One-third of 3 is (1/3) * 3 = 1.

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

Let x be the actual number of people who attended the concert. We can set up the equation:

x = 0.8 * 48

To find x, we multiply 0.8 by 48.

x = 0.8 * 48
x = 38.4

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that Jason carried 2 balls, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. This means Jeffrey carried half the number of balls Jason carried, which is 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them: 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

However, this is the number of balls the boys carried, not the total number of balls the coach brought to practice. Since the boys carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is equal to the number of balls the boys carried.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many holes the pirates dug in total by the end of the third day, and then determine how many holes they dug on the fourth day.

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes on the third day. So, the total number of holes at the end of the third day is:

10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is:

10 * 4 = 40

Since there were 29 holes at the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:

40 - 29 = 11

So, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and the third person got 15 more than each of them. 

Let's denote the number of corn chips the third person got as x. Since the third person got 15 more than Amora and Lainey, we can write an equation:

x = 70 + 15
x = 85

So, the third person got 85 corn chips. 

Now, we know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and the third person got 85 corn chips. To find the total number of corn chips, we add the number of corn chips each person got:

Total corn chips = 70 + 70 + 85
Total corn chips = 225

First, let's find 50% of the cost of supplies. 50% of $400 is 0.5 * 400 = $200.

Now, we add this to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel. $400 (supplies) + $200 (50% of supplies) = $600.

The cost of travel is $600."
"Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as X. We are given the following information:

1. X = S + 5
2. S = 4A - 13
3. X + S + A = 339

We can substitute the first equation into the third equation to get:
(S + 5) + S + A = 339
Combine like terms:
2S + A + 5 = 339

Now, substitute the second equation into the above equation:
2(4A - 13) + A + 5 = 339
Expand the equation:
8A - 26 + A + 5 = 339
Combine like terms:
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide both sides by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to find half of the number of minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, there are 20 minutes per episode. Half of 20 is 10. 

So, there are 10 episodes in total. 

To find the total time spent watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode: 10 episodes * 20 minutes per episode = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and then add it to the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the southerly direction for the first 10 hours:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours
Distance = 300 miles

Then, the bird flies towards the north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 36 miles

Since the bird is flying north, this distance is subtracted from the total southerly distance:
Total southerly distance = 300 miles - 36 miles
Total southerly distance = 264 miles

Finally, the bird flies towards the south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 110 miles

Since the bird is flying south, this distance is added to the total southerly distance:
Total distance = 264 miles + 110 miles
Total distance = 374 miles

The final answer is: 374"
"To find the total number of brownies Greta had left over, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and subtract the number of brownies eaten.

Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself, which is 12 brownies. 
She received 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office, which is 6 brownies. 
Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies. 
So, the total number of brownies she received is 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

To find the number of brownies left over, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies received: 66 - 18 = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total age of all three family members, we first need to determine the age of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means her age is 75% of Nani's age. To find 75% of Nani's age, we multiply his age by 0.75: 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now that we have the ages of all three family members, we can find the total age by adding their ages together: 8 (Nani) + 16 (brother) + 6 (sister) = 30 years.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time it takes for each type of string and then add them together.

For synthetic gut racquets: 3 racquets * 15 minutes per racquet = 45 minutes
For polyester string racquets: 5 racquets * 22 minutes per racquet = 110 minutes
For hybrid sets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes per racquet = 72 minutes

Now, we add the time for each type of string together: 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes

The final answer is: 227"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first two phones and the remaining phones. 

The first two phones cost the full price of $600 each, so the total cost for the first two phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.

The remaining phones are 2 (for the kids and his wife), and each of these phones is half the price of the first two. So, the price of each of these phones is $600 / 2 = $300.

The total cost for the remaining phones is 2 * $300 = $600.

Now, we add the cost of the first two phones and the remaining phones to get the total cost: $1200 + $600 = $1800.

The final answer is: $1800"
"To find the total number of players in both teams, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team by adding 7 to 13.

Zeke's team = Carlton's team + 7
Zeke's team = 13 + 7
Zeke's team = 20

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team.

Total players = Zeke's team + Carlton's team
Total players = 20 + 13
Total players = 33

The final answer is: 33"
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the length (l) is 15 feet and the width (w) is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(15 + 10)
P = 2(25)
P = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

50 feet * 2 slats/foot = 100 slats

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats for his fence.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we first need to determine how many boxes she had left after giving some to her mom and sister. 

She bought 12 boxes and gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, so she gave away a total of 2 + 2 = 4 boxes. 

Now, we subtract the boxes she gave away from the total number of boxes she bought: 12 - 4 = 8 boxes.

Each box contains 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges in 8 boxes is 8 * 20 = 160 oranges.

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 160 = 40 oranges. 

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges: 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total number of states in both countries, we first need to determine the number of states in each country. 

The USA has 50 states. 

Half of 50 is 25. 

India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, so India has 25 + 4 = 29 states.

Now, we add the number of states in the USA and India together: 50 + 29 = 79.

The total number of states in both countries together is 79."
"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books. 

The total cost of the books is the sum of the cost of the dictionary, the dinosaur book, and the children's cookbook. 

Total cost = $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, we need to subtract this from the total cost to find out how much more he needs to earn.

Amount needed to earn = Total cost - Amount saved = $39 - $14 = $25

Now, we can find out how many hours Tyler needs to work by dividing the amount he needs to earn by his hourly wage.

Hours needed to work = Amount needed to earn / Hourly wage = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many cherries Robert has more than Jerry, we first need to determine how many cherries Richard and Jerry have. 

Since Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more than Richard, we can find out how many cherries Richard has by subtracting 10 from Robert's total: 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.

Now, we know that the total number of cherries is 60. We can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the total number of cherries Robert and Richard have from the total: 60 - 30 - 20 = 10 cherries.

Now that we know how many cherries Richard and Jerry have, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry by subtracting Jerry's total from Robert's total: 30 - 10 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much Sunny earned, we need to calculate the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie he sold on both days and then multiply it by their respective prices.

Let's denote the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday as G. Since he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie on Saturday than on Sunday, the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday is 15 - 4 = 11.

On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday is G + 5. The number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday is given as 15.

The total number of boxes of gingerbread sold over the two days is G + (G + 5) = 2G + 5. The total number of boxes of apple pie sold is 11 + 15 = 26.

The total earnings from gingerbread is (2G + 5) * 6 and the total earnings from apple pie is 26 * 15.

We know that the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday is 10. So, G = 10.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings: 
Total earnings from gingerbread = (2 * 10 + 5) * 6 = 25 * 6 = 150
Total earnings from apple pie = 26 * 15 = 390

Total earnings = 150 + 390 = 540

The final answer is: 540"
"To determine the total amount of sunscreen needed, we need to calculate the total number of ounces Pamela will use over the 8 days. 

Since she reapplies sunscreen every hour and will be outside 4 hours a day, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day. 

Over 8 days, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times/day * 8 days = 32 times.

Since each application is 1 ounce, she will need 32 ounces of sunscreen.

Each bottle contains 8 ounces, so to find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total ounces needed by the ounces per bottle: 32 ounces / 8 ounces per bottle = 4 bottles.

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen. 

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

First, let's find 40% of the price of the blue car:
40% of $100 = 0.4 * $100 = $40

Now, subtract $40 from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car:
$100 - $40 = $60

So, the price of the red car is $60.

The price of the blue car is $100.

The final answer is: $60"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Emil is 19 years old now. When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad and twice as old as his brother. 

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B. 

We know that E = 19. 

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = 0.5D. 

We can solve for D: D = 24 / 0.5 = 48.

When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B. 

We can solve for B: B = 24 / 2 = 12.

Now that we have the ages of Emil's dad and brother when Emil turns 24, we need to find their current ages. 

Since Emil is 19 now, his dad's current age is D - (24 - 19) = 48 - 5 = 43.

His brother's current age is B - (24 - 19) = 12 - 5 = 7.

The sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is 43 + 7 = 50.

"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads she received from her mother, sister, and friend, and then add them together.

Adrianne's mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day and add them together.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by the serving size: 21 / 3 = 7.

"To find the number of students leaving early, we first need to find the number of football players, and then add the number of cheerleaders or band members.

First, let's find the number of football players. 20% of 30 students are football players. 

20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6

So, there are 6 football players.

Now, let's find the number of remaining students. Since 6 students are football players, the remaining students are 30 - 6 = 24.

Out of the remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band.

25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6

So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members.

Now, let's add the number of football players and cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early.

6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we first need to determine Charlie's shoe size. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size five boots, we can calculate Charlie's size as follows:

Charlie's size = 5 * Sophie's size
Charlie's size = 5 * 5
Charlie's size = 25

Now, we can find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie by adding their sizes and dividing by 2:

Average size = (Sophie's size + Charlie's size) / 2
Average size = (5 + 25) / 2
Average size = 30 / 2
Average size = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to calculate the total space available for plants. 

First, we need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches since the width of the plants is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the length of the flower bed in inches is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches.

Next, we need to subtract the space between the plants. Since there are 17 plants, there will be 16 spaces between them. The total space between the plants is 16 * 1.5 = 24 feet, which is 24 * 12 = 288 inches.

Now, we subtract the total space between the plants from the total length of the flower bed to get the total space available for the plants: 1332 - 288 = 1044 inches.

Since each plant is 12 inches wide, we can divide the total space available for plants by the width of a plant to get the total number of plants that can fit: 1044 / 12 = 87.

However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so we need to subtract 17 from the total number of plants that can fit to find out how many more plants she needs to buy: 87 - 17 = 70.

The cost of each plant is $6, so we multiply the number of plants Pat needs to buy by the cost of each plant to find the total cost: 70 * 6 = 420.

The final answer is: $420"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day, we need to calculate 1/2 of the number of pretzels Edgar eats in a day. 

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day.

Cost of 15 petunias = 15 * $3.00 = $45.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of sweet potato vines:
5 baskets * 2 sweet potato vines per basket = 10 sweet potato vines
Cost of 10 sweet potato vines = 10 * $2.50 = $25.00

Now, let's add the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines together:
Total cost = $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we first need to calculate how much she saves each month. 

Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets 25% of her paycheck aside for shoes. To find 25% of $2,000.00, we multiply $2,000.00 by 0.25.

$2,000.00 * 0.25 = $500.00

So, Jessica saves $500.00 each month for shoes.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly savings by 12 to find the yearly savings.

$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy with her yearly savings. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp. 

First, let's find out how long it takes her to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, we can divide 90 by 6 to get the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. 

90 / 6 = 15 minutes

However, this is only the time it takes to peel the shrimp. We also need to consider the time it takes to cook them. It takes her 10 minutes to cook 30 shrimp. To find out how many batches of 30 shrimp she needs to cook, we can divide 90 by 30.

90 / 30 = 3

Since she needs to cook 3 batches of 30 shrimp, and each batch takes 10 minutes, we can multiply the number of batches by the cooking time.

3 * 10 = 30 minutes

However, this is the time it takes to cook the shrimp. We also need to add the time it takes to peel the shrimp, which is 15 minutes. 

15 + 30 = 45 minutes

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

The final answer is: 45"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in temperature after the air conditioner has been running and turned off.

First, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner is running on low for 3 hours:

Temperature change on low = -2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = -6 degrees

Then, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner is running on high for 4 hours:

Temperature change on high = -3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = -12 degrees

The total temperature change when the air conditioner is running is the sum of the temperature changes on low and high:

Total temperature change while running = -6 degrees - 12 degrees = -18 degrees

Now, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner is turned off for 2 hours:

Temperature change when off = 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees

The net temperature change is the sum of the total temperature change while running and the temperature change when the air conditioner is turned off:

Net temperature change = -18 degrees + 4 degrees = -14 degrees

Since the air conditioner cools the room, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how old Bill's dad was when he saw the comet for the first time, and then use that information to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time.

Let's denote the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet as 'x'. Since Bill saw the comet when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, Bill's age at that time is 3x.

We know that the time between two sightings of the comet is 75 years. So, the difference between the ages of Bill and his dad when they saw the comet is 75 years. 

We can set up the equation: 3x - x = 75

Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x = 75

Dividing both sides by 2, we get: x = 37.5

This is the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet for the first time. 

Now, we need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time. We know that Bill's age at the second sighting is 3x, which is 3 * 37.5 = 112.5 years.

However, we are asked to find Bill's age at the first sighting. Since the time between the two sightings is 75 years, we need to subtract 75 from Bill's age at the second sighting to find his age at the first sighting.

Bill's age at the first sighting = 112.5 - 75 = 37.5

However, this is the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet. We need to find Bill's age at the first sighting. Since Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet, and the comet appears every 75 years, Bill's dad saw the comet 2 times before Bill saw it for the first time. 

So, Bill's dad was 30 + 75 = 105 years old when he saw the comet for the second time. 

Now, we can find Bill's age at the first sighting by subtracting 75 from Bill's age at the second sighting. However, we need to find Bill's age at the second sighting. 

Since Bill's age at the second sighting is 3 times his dad's age at the second sighting, Bill's age at the second sighting is 3 * 105 = 315.

"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each category and then add them together.

1. Checks for the electric bill: 1 check per month, so 12 checks per year.
2. Checks for the gas bill: 1 check per month, so 12 checks per year.
3. Checks to the church: 2 checks per month, so 24 checks per year.
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 1 check every 3 months, so 4 checks per year.

Now, let's add the total number of checks: 
12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52

The final answer is: 52"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as 'x'. Since the second plane makes half the number of flights as the first plane, the total number of flights made by the second plane is 'x/2'.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, which is (3/4)x. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is (1/4)x.

We are given that the second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips. Since this is half the number of trips the first plane makes, we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 44

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:

x = 88

Now that we know the total number of flights made by the first plane, we can find the number of flights to France:

Flights to France = (1/4)x
= (1/4)(88)
= 22

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the individual howling times and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6. 
His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since the trousers cost $30, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers to find out how much he had to contribute from his savings: $30 - $18 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to find the average age of the group. We know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Let's denote the average age as 'x'. 

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, Helene's age is 2x. 

We also know that the total age of the children is 20. We can set up an equation to represent this:

Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age = Total age
3 + 4 + 2x + Wilfred's age = 20

Combine the known ages:
7 + 2x + Wilfred's age = 20

Subtract 7 from both sides:
2x + Wilfred's age = 13

Now, we need to find the value of 'x'. We know that Helene's age is 2x and the total age of the group is 20. We can set up another equation:

Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age = Total age
3 + 4 + 2x + Wilfred's age = 20

Substitute 2x for Helene's age:
3 + 4 + 2x + Wilfred's age = 20

Combine the known ages:
7 + 2x + Wilfred's age = 20

Subtract 7 from both sides:
2x + Wilfred's age = 13

We also know that Helene's age is twice the average age, so we can set up another equation:
Helene's age = 2 * Average age
2x = 2 * x + x
2x = 3x

Subtract 2x from both sides:
0 = x

This is a contradiction, as x cannot be 0. However, we can try another approach. We know that Helene is twice as old as the average age, so we can set up an equation:
Helene's age = 2 * Average age
2x = 2 * ( (3 + 4 + Wilfred's age) / 4 )

Simplify the equation:
2x = 2 * (7 + Wilfred's age) / 4
2x = (14 + 2 * Wilfred's age) / 2
4x = 14 + 2 * Wilfred's age

Subtract 14 from both sides:
4x - 14 = 2 * Wilfred's age

We also know that 2x + Wilfred's age = 13. We can substitute 2x from this equation into the previous equation:
(2x + Wilfred's age) - 14 = 2 * Wilfred's age
13 - 14 = 2 * Wilfred's age - Wilfred's age
-1 = Wilfred's age

However, this is not possible, as age cannot be negative. Let's try another approach. We know that Helene is twice as old as the average age, so we can set up an equation:

"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund. 

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Since everyone else donates a total of $2000, Walter's lawyer will donate 3 * $2000 = $6000.

However, the question states that Walter is going to tell his lawyer about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200. This implies that the friend's donation is not included in the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund. Therefore, the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund is still $2000, and the lawyer will donate 3 * $2000 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"
"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we first need to find out the total number of cookies. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is 1500 * 1/2 = 750.

Now, we know that each person in the church got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church, we need to divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got. 

Number of people in the church = Total cookies given to the church / Cookies per person
= 750 / 15
= 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, let's assume the total number of slices the watermelon is divided into is 'x'. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is 6. 

Let's denote the number of slices each kid gets as 'k'. Since each adult gets twice as many slices as each kid, the number of slices each adult gets is '2k'. 

We know that the total number of slices is 6, so we can write the equation: 2 * 2k + 4 * k = 6. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 4k + 4k = 6, which is 8k = 6. 

Dividing both sides by 8, we get k = 6/8, which simplifies to k = 3/4.

Since each adult gets 2k slices, each adult gets 2 * (3/4) = 3/2 slices.

The total number of slices is 6, so the total number of slices is 6. The total number of slices the adults get is 2 * (3/2) = 3. 

The percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is (3/6) * 100, which is 50%.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we first need to calculate the total time he spends on rounds and appointments.

Time spent on rounds: 
- Number of inpatients: 9
- Time per inpatient: 20 minutes
- Total time spent on rounds: 9 * 20 = 180 minutes

Time spent on appointments: 
- Number of appointments: 10
- Time per appointment: 30 minutes
- Total time spent on appointments: 10 * 30 = 300 minutes

Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 + 300 = 480 minutes

Since Doctor Jones works for 9 hours at the clinic, we need to convert this to minutes: 
- 9 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 540 minutes

Now, we subtract the total time spent on rounds and appointments from the total time he works: 
- 540 minutes - 480 minutes = 60 minutes

To convert the remaining time back to hours: 
- 60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

So, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records.

"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required for the entire process. 

First, let's add up the time for making the cake batter, baking the cake, and frosting the cake: 
20 minutes (cake batter) + 30 minutes (baking) + 10 minutes (frosting) = 60 minutes

However, we also need to consider the time it takes for the cake to cool, which is 2 hours or 120 minutes. 

Now, let's add the cooling time to the previous total: 
60 minutes (preparation and baking) + 120 minutes (cooling) = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours: 
180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

Now, we know that Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm. To find the latest time she can start making the cake, we need to subtract the total time required from the desired serving time. 

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to first determine the total number of boxes sold by both Lisa and Peter. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so together they sold 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

Since they sold 64 chocolate bars together and they sold 8 boxes, we can divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes to find out how many chocolate bars are in a box.

64 / 8 = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to first calculate the daily earnings and then multiply it by the number of days in a month.

The daily earnings can be calculated as follows:

- The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
- The cost per student per session is $1.50.
- The studio has 10 students, so the total cost per session for students is 10 * $1.50 = $15.
- The total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $15 (students) = $40.
- The studio is rented 3 days a week, so the weekly earnings are 3 * $40 = $120.
- There are approximately 4 weeks in a month, so the monthly earnings are 4 * $120 = $480.

However, this calculation does not take into account the number of sessions per week. Since we don't know the number of sessions per week, we'll assume a standard 5-day week for a dance studio, which is common. 

- The studio is rented 3 days a week, but it's likely that there are 5 sessions per week (one session per day). 
- The weekly earnings are 5 * $40 = $200.
- The monthly earnings are 4 * $200 = $800.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $800. 

The final answer is: $800"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box for both Peter and Martha, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

For Peter: 64 chocolate bars / 4 boxes = 16 chocolate bars per box
For Martha: 56 chocolate bars / 7 boxes = 8 chocolate bars per box

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha. 
16 (Peter's chocolate bars per box) - 8 (Martha's chocolate bars per box) = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we multiply the total population by 3/5. 

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, we need to find the total number of babies born in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

Total babies born in a year = 30 * 4 * 12 = 1440

Now, we add the total number of babies born in a year to the initial population to find the total number of porcupines after a year.

Total porcupines after a year = 50 + 1440 = 1490

The final answer is: 1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the gallons of water needed, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. There are 7.48 gallons in a cubic foot, so:

Volume in gallons = 1400 * 7.48
Volume in gallons = 10472 gallons

Now, we multiply the volume in gallons by 5.9 to get the total gallons of water needed:
Total gallons = 10472 * 5.9
Total gallons = 61851.28 gallons

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the total gallons by the cost per gallon:
Cost = 61851.28 * 0.10
Cost = 6185.128

The final answer is: $6185.13"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to calculate the number of each color and add them together.

We know there are 9 red sticks. 
There are 5 more blue sticks than red, so the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.
The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we add the number of sticks of each color together: 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the distance traveled by Matteo, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles.

To find the distance traveled by Shandy, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles.

Now, we subtract the distance traveled by Matteo from the distance traveled by Shandy to find the difference: 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the total number of female students, we first need to find the number of students over 16 and under 16, and then calculate the number of female students in each group.

Half of the students are over 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500 students.
One-fourth of the students over 16 are male: 1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16. 
So, the number of female students over 16 is 1500 - 375 = 1125.

The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500 students.
One-half of the students under 16 are male: 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16.
So, the number of female students under 16 is 1500 - 750 = 750.

Now, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16 to get the total number of female students: 1125 + 750 = 1875.

The final answer is: 1875"
"To find out how many laps each person can run, we need to calculate their individual lap counts.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we need to subtract Quinn's lap count from Bethany's lap count: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank and subtract it from the tank's capacity.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons. 

The remaining amount of water needed to fill the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x.

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is 0.91x (since 100% - 9% = 91%).

In the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining is 0.93 * 0.91x = 0.8539x (since 93% of 91% is 0.93 * 0.91).

We are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. So, we can set up the equation:

0.8539x = 0.28

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.8539:

x = 0.28 / 0.8539
x = 0.327

So, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 32.7%.

The final answer is: 32.7"
"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings. 

Her hourly wage is $10, and she works 40 hours a week, so her weekly wage is 10 * 40 = $400.

She also earns $15 an hour from tips, so her total weekly earnings from tips is 15 * 40 = $600.

Her total weekly earnings is the sum of her wage and tips, which is 400 + 600 = $1000.

The down payment for the car is $10,000, and Janet wants to save 20% of this amount. 20% of $10,000 is 0.2 * 10000 = $2000.

To find out how many weeks she needs to work, we divide the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her total weekly earnings ($1000). 

2000 / 1000 = 2

So, Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has spent so far. 

3 peaches at $0.5 each will be 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
4 pears at $0.5 each will be 4 * $0.5 = $2
2 kiwis at $1 each will be 2 * $1 = $2
5 apples at $0.75 each will be 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Adding these amounts together, Jamaar has spent $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9 so far.

He started with $10, so he has $10 - $9 = $1 left.

Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can divide the remaining amount by the cost of a plum to find out how many he can buy: $1 / $0.25 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each friend received, we first need to determine the total number of packs Anne gave away. Since she kept 2 packs for herself, she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Next, we need to find out how many packs each friend received. Since Anne gave the packs to her 10 friends equally, we divide the total number of packs given away (13) by the number of friends (10). 

13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs per friend. However, since each pack contains 60 pieces, we need to multiply the number of packs each friend received by the number of pieces in each pack.

1.3 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 78 pieces per friend.

"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures by 8.

Total pictures = 72
Pictures per album = Total pictures / Number of albums
Pictures per album = 72 / 8
Pictures per album = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits, the remaining 3 albums must be a mix of both selfies and portraits. However, we are not given any information about the mix of selfies and portraits in these 3 albums. 

But we can still find the total number of selfies and portraits. Since 3 albums were selfies only, the total number of selfies is 3 * 9 = 27. Similarly, since 2 albums were portraits only, the total number of portraits is 2 * 9 = 18.

"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to determine how many sets of 3 pages he reads and then multiply that by the time it takes him to read one set of 3 pages.

Since James reads 18 pages, we can divide 18 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 pages he reads: 18 / 3 = 6.

Now, we know it takes James 10 minutes to read one set of 3 pages. Since he reads 6 sets, we multiply 10 minutes by 6: 10 * 6 = 60.

James spends 60 minutes reading."
"To find the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to calculate the number of guests who checked in and subtract the number of guests who checked out.

Initially, there were 100 guests. 

24 guests checked out early, so the remaining guests are 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, so the number of guests who have checked out is 24 (early checkouts) + 15 (late checkouts) = 39.

The number of guests who have not checked out is 76 - 39 = 37.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30.

So, the total number of guests who have checked in is 30 (in the afternoon) + 7 (after dinner) = 37.

Now, we add the number of guests who have checked in to the number of guests who have not checked out: 37 (guests who have not checked out) + 37 (guests who have checked in) = 74.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 's' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'l'. We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write an equation:

s = 2l

We also know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4. Since Teresa sold 's' small stuffed animals, the total amount of money she earned from small stuffed animals is 4s.

The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal, which is 3 * 4 = $12. Since Teresa sold 'l' large stuffed animals, the total amount of money she earned from large stuffed animals is 12l.

We are given that Teresa earned a total of $120 from the sales. So, we can write another equation:

4s + 12l = 120

Now we can substitute the expression for 's' from the first equation into the second equation:

4(2l) + 12l = 120

Expanding the equation, we get:

8l + 12l = 120

Combine like terms:

20l = 120

Divide both sides by 20:

l = 6

Now that we know the number of large stuffed animals, we can find the number of small stuffed animals:

s = 2l
s = 2(6)
s = 12

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then multiply it by 40 dwarves and 30 days.

First, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe. Since he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe as with his bare hands, he can mine 2 * 12 = 24 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe.

Next, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. Since he can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe, he can mine 24 + (24 * 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.

"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for the first two packages. 

The ratio for the first package is $3 / 2 sandwiches. 
The ratio for the second package is $6 / 4 sandwiches.

To find the common ratio, we can divide the ratio of the second package by the ratio of the first package: ($6 / 4) / ($3 / 2) = (6 * 2) / (4 * 3) = 12 / 12 = 1.

This means that the price increases by the same factor for each additional sandwich. Since the first package has 2 sandwiches and the second package has 4 sandwiches, the price increases by a factor of 2 (4 / 2 = 2).

Now, we can use this factor to find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches. The price of the first package is $3, and the number of sandwiches is 2. The price of the package with 8 sandwiches will be the price of the first package multiplied by the factor 4 (8 / 2 = 4), which is $3 * 4 = $12.

However, we need to consider the factor of 2 that we found earlier. Since the price increases by a factor of 2 for each additional sandwich, and the package with 8 sandwiches has 4 times as many sandwiches as the first package, we need to multiply the price by 2^2 (2 squared) or 4. 

So, the price of the package with 8 sandwiches is $12 * 4 = $48.

"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we first need to calculate the remaining amount he owes after using the money from selling his old bedroom set.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount Tom gets from selling his old bedroom: $1000
Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we need to calculate 10% of $2000.

10% of $2000 = 0.1 * $2000 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month.

"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 40% of 25 is 0.4 * 25 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 12 / 2 = 6. So, 6 yellow balloons were released, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Then, Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

Now, let's calculate the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school. She had 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons. 

Total number of balloons = 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34

"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the scenarios where he won't get an extension. 

First, let's consider the case where the substitute teacher is present. In this case, there's a 50% chance of the substitute teacher being present, and since the homework won't be collected in this scenario, the probability of having to turn in the homework is 0.

Next, let's consider the case where the normal teacher is present. In this case, there's a 60% chance (100% - 40% extension chance). Within this 60%, there's a 80% chance (100% - 20% chance of getting a personal extension) that Marcus won't get an extension.

Now, we can calculate the probability of having to turn in the homework:

- Probability of substitute teacher: 50% * 0 = 0
- Probability of normal teacher and no extension: 60% * 80% = 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.48

The total probability of having to turn in the homework is the sum of these two probabilities: 0 + 0.48 = 0.48, or 48%.

"To find out how many tickets each graduate can receive, we first need to determine the total number of available seats for guests. 

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center: 6000
Seats for graduates: 950
Seats for faculty: 300

Total seats taken: 950 + 300 = 1250
Available seats for guests: 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive.

4750 / 950 = 5

So, each graduate can receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the relationship between the number of small beans and the number of large beans. 

First, we know that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. This means that the number of small beans is 3 times the number of medium beans.

Since Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, the number of medium beans is 2 times the number of large beans. 

Let's denote the number of large beans as L. Then the number of medium beans is 2L, and the number of small beans is 3 * 2L = 6L.

We are given that it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up. Therefore, L = 75.

Now, we can find the number of small beans by substituting L = 75 into the equation for the number of small beans: 6L = 6 * 75 = 450.

The final answer is: 450"
"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total earnings and total expenses. 

Her total earnings are $15 per day for 3 days, so her total earnings are 15 * 3 = $45.

Her total expenses are $3 per day for 3 days, so her total expenses are 3 * 3 = $9.

Now, we subtract her total expenses from her total earnings to find her net earnings: 45 - 9 = $36.

Since she spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, her total hours worked is 6 * 3 = 18 hours.

To find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her net earnings by her total hours worked: 36 / 18 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of the books is 3 * 16 = 48 dollars.
The cost of the pencils is 3 * 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the books and the pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

So, Ted spent a total of 66 dollars.

The final answer is: $66"
"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to first determine how many soda bottles he will place along the driveway. 

Since the driveway is 24 feet wide and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet, we can divide the width of the driveway by the spacing between the bottles to find the total number of bottles:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since it takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we can multiply the number of bottles by the time it takes to set off each one:

8 bottles * 5 seconds per bottle = 40 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 40 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many packs Uncle Franky can make, we first need to determine the total number of apples he has. Since he ordered two boxes and each box has 40 apples, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of apples per box.

Total apples = 2 boxes * 40 apples/box = 80 apples

Next, we need to find out how many packs he can make with 80 apples. Since each pack has 8 apples, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack.

Number of packs = Total apples / apples per pack = 80 / 8 = 10

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought and subtract that from the initial amount of money she had.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 * $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 * $6 = $18.
The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor starts with $50, so subtracting the total cost of the cheese from that amount, we get $50 - $40 = $10.

The final answer is: $10"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost due to loans and lost income while in school. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of loans he took out: 
$50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money he lost due to not working while in school. 
His income before college was $25,000/year. 
His income after college is $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year. 
The difference in income is $75,000/year - $25,000/year = $50,000/year. 
The total amount of money he lost due to not working while in school is $50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000.

The total amount of money he needs to earn is the sum of the loans and the lost income: 
$200,000 (loans) + $200,000 (lost income) = $400,000.

Now, let's calculate how long it will take him to earn this amount at his new income of $75,000/year. 
Time = Total amount / Annual income 
Time = $400,000 / $75,000 
Time = 5.33 years

The final answer is: 5.33"
"To find the total area of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the two pieces of fabric. 

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, we add 2 feet to both the length and the width of the bed.

New length = 6 + 2 = 8 feet
New width = 8 + 2 = 10 feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the new dimensions by 2 to get the total area of fabric needed.

Total length = 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Total width = 10 * 2 = 20 feet

Now, we multiply the total length and total width to get the total area of fabric needed.

Total area = Total length * Total width = 16 * 20 = 320 square feet

The total area of fabric Jim needs to buy is 320 square feet."
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then add them up.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 17 more than that is 85 + 17 = 102. So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 5 more than that is 204 + 5 = 209. So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, let's add up the number of letters delivered each day: 425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

The final answer is: 736"

The cost of the chicken salad is 10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.
The cost of the pasta salad is 6 people * $6 per person = $36.

Now, we add the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad together: $65 + $36 = $101.

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101."
"To find the average loss, we need to calculate the total loss and then divide it by the number of races. 

First, let's calculate the amount Johnny's dad lost in the first race: -$5.

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, the amount he won in the second race is 2 * (-$5) + $1 = -$9. 

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, the amount he lost in the third race is 1.5 * (-$9) = -$13.50.

Now, let's calculate the total loss: -$5 + (-$9) + (-$13.50) = -$27.50.

There were 3 races. To find the average loss, we divide the total loss by the number of races: -$27.50 / 3 = -$9.17.

"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we first need to calculate their current heights. 

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet, which is equivalent to 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches). He grew 3 inches over the summer, so his current height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Cole's initial height was 50 inches and he grew 2 inches over the summer, so his current height is 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

The difference in height between Cole and Xavier is 52 - 51 = 1 inch.

The final answer is: 1"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the share of the first person as x. 

Since the second person took $80 more than the first, the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Combine like terms: x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920.

Combine like terms again: 4x + 240 = 1920.

Subtract 240 from both sides: 4x = 1680.

Divide both sides by 4: x = 420.

The share of the first person is $420.

The final answer is: $420"
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we first need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks have 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since the painters worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to convert 3/8ths to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days to get the total hours worked: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4 to get the hours worked by each painter: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms again:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

Number of balls in the first set = x + 4
= 6 + 4

"To find the price of the car in the year 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation of the car from 2007 to 2010.

The car was bought in 2007 for $20,000. 

The price of the car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. 

First, we'll calculate the depreciation for the first year (2008):
Depreciation = 21% of $20,000 = 0.21 * $20,000 = $4,200
Price in 2008 = $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800

Next, we'll calculate the depreciation for the second year (2009):
Depreciation = 21% of $15,800 = 0.21 * $15,800 = $3,318
Price in 2009 = $15,800 - $3,318 = $12,482

Finally, we'll calculate the depreciation for the third year (2010):
Depreciation = 21% of $12,482 = 0.21 * $12,482 = $2,623.22
Price in 2010 = $12,482 - $2,623.22 = $9,858.78

The price of the car in the year 2010 is $9,858.78.

$9,858.78"
"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to determine the total number of books that are not written in English. 

Since half of the books are written in English, that's 50 / 2 = 25 books in English.

We are also given that 10% of the books are written in German. To find the number of German books, we need to calculate 10% of 50, which is 0.1 * 50 = 5 books in German.

Now, to find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books: 50 - 25 - 5 = 20 books in Spanish.

First, let's calculate the total distance Bernice has driven: 
Distance driven = 325 kilometers/day * 4 days = 1300 kilometers

Now, let's subtract the distance driven from the total distance:
Total distance = 1955 kilometers
Distance driven = 1300 kilometers
Distance left = Total distance - Distance driven
Distance left = 1955 - 1300
Distance left = 655 kilometers

"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we first need to calculate how many cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. To find out how many cups she drinks in 30 days, we multiply the number of cups she drinks per day by 30.

8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups

Now, we need to convert the total number of cups to gallons. There are 16 cups in a gallon. To find out how many gallons, we divide the total number of cups by 16.

240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Romeo boards the train with 120 people.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the total number of people on the train becomes:
120 (initial people) + 20 (new people) = 140

At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (100 people) board the train. So, the total number of people on the train becomes:
140 (previous total) - 50 (people who descended) = 90
90 + 100 (new people) = 190

At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the total number of people on the train becomes:
190 (previous total) - 80 (people who descended) = 110

"To find the total amount Alison spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

1. The tank top costs $10.
2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48, but they were on sale for half price. Half of $48 is $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The athletic socks cost $8, and she had a coupon for $2 off, so the socks cost $8 - $2 = $6.

"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a week, we need to calculate the total number of twin and king size sheets he puts on the beds and then divide that by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. Since each twin bed requires 1 set of sheets and the king size bed requires 1 set, the total number of sets of sheets he puts on the beds is 4 (twin) + 1 (king) = 5 sets.

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 1, which is 2. This means that Greg can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, which is equivalent to 3 sets of sheets.

Now, we divide the total number of sets of sheets (5) by the number of sets he can wash at a time (3) to find out how many loads of laundry he does in a week: 5 / 3 = 1.67. However, since we can't have a fraction of a load, we round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, we round up to 2 loads of laundry per week.

To find out how many loads of laundry he does in a year, we multiply the number of loads per week by the number of weeks in a year: 2 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 104 loads/year.

The total number of stickers Leo has in his collection is 250."
"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount of cat food each cat eats per day (60 grams).

First, we need to calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's 3 cats eat per day. Since each cat eats 60 grams of food twice a day, we multiply 60 grams by 2 to get the daily consumption per cat, which is 120 grams. Then, we multiply this by the number of cats, which is 3.

Daily consumption per cat: 60 grams * 2 = 120 grams
Total daily consumption for 3 cats: 120 grams * 3 = 360 grams

Now, we divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the total daily consumption (360 grams) to find out how many days it will last.

720 grams / 360 grams = 2

The cat food will last for 2 days."

"Let's denote the time Donovan took as 'x'. Since Betsy took 18 minutes longer than Donovan, the time Betsy took is 'x + 18'. 

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of the time taken by both Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. So, we can write the equation as x + (x + 18) = 98.

Combine like terms: 2x + 18 = 98.

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

Since x is the time Donovan took, and Betsy took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's time is x + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58.

The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill for 30 pills. So, the cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

The cost of parking is $6/hour for 2 hours. So, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add the costs together: $200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."

"To find the total number of pizzas left, we first need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 
70% of 20 is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 
They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

The total number of pizzas eaten is 14 (by the glee club) + 32 (by the football team) = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered is 20 (by the glee club) + 40 (by the football team) = 60 pizzas.

The number of pizzas left is the total number of pizzas ordered minus the total number of pizzas eaten, which is 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of big coupons. Since there are twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and there are 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is 2 * 700 = 1400.

The cost of mailing the small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

The cost of mailing the big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

Now, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons together: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

"To find out how many meatballs were in the sub sandwiches that remained, we first need to determine how many meatballs Sidney initially ordered. 

Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, so Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches. 

Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, so Sidney initially had 7 * 4 = 28 meatballs.

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, which means he ate 4 * 4 = 16 meatballs.

After Mark ate 4 of the sub sandwiches, Sidney had 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches left. 

Sidney then ordered 3 more sub sandwiches, so he had a total of 3 + 3 = 6 sub sandwiches left.

The total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

"To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we first need to determine the number of trucks that did not experience mechanical failures. 

Since a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, we can calculate the number of trucks that failed as follows:

Number of trucks dispatched = 20
Number of trucks with mechanical failures = 20 * (1/4) = 5

Now, we subtract the number of trucks with mechanical failures from the total number of trucks dispatched to find the number of trucks that reached the farmers:

Number of trucks that reached the farmers = 20 - 5 = 15

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we multiply the number of trucks that reached the farmers by the tons of fertiliser each truck carried:

Total tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers = 15 * 20 = 300

"To find the total cost of the butter, we first need to determine how much Dennis needs to buy. Since he needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

Since the grocery store has a promotion for buy one pound of butter get one half off, we can calculate the cost as follows:

- For the first pound of butter, the cost is $4.00.
- For the second pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).
- For the third pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).
- For the fourth pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).
- For the fifth pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).
- For the sixth pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).

The total cost of the butter is $4.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 = $12.00.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find the total cost of the party, we first need to determine the total number of guests. Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 dance class girls, and 13 family members, but 4 people said they could not come. 

Total invited guests = 25 (classmates) + 7 (dance class girls) + 13 (family members) = 45
Guests who could not come = 4
Total guests attending = Total invited guests - Guests who could not come = 45 - 4 = 41

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. Since there are 41 guests, we need to find the number of additional guests beyond the initial 20.

Additional guests = Total guests attending - Initial 20 guests = 41 - 20 = 21

Now, we can calculate the total cost by adding the initial fee and the cost for the additional guests.

Total cost = Initial fee + (Additional guests * Cost per additional guest)
Total cost = $125 + (21 * $6)
Total cost = $125 + $126
Total cost = $251

The final answer is: $251"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Maggie and Riza had initially. Since they both have $60 after spending a portion of their money, we can set up an equation to represent the situation.

Let's say Maggie had x dollars initially. Since she spent a quarter of her money, she has 3/4x dollars left. Similarly, let's say Riza had y dollars initially. Since she spent one-third of her money, she has 2/3y dollars left.

We know that both of them have $60 left, so we can set up the following equations:

3/4x = 60
2/3y = 60

To solve for x and y, we can multiply both sides of each equation by the reciprocal of the fraction:

x = 60 * 4/3 = 80
y = 60 * 3/2 = 90

Now that we know Maggie had $80 and Riza had $90 initially, we can find the total amount of money they had:

Total money = x + y = 80 + 90 = 170

However, the question asks for the amount of money they have left, which is $60 each. To find the total amount of money they have left, we need to multiply the amount each of them has by 2:

Total money left = 2 * 60 = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to determine how many bananas the second monkey eats. 

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Since there are three monkeys and they eat a total of 315 bananas in a week, we need to find out how many bananas they eat in a day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of bananas eaten in a day is 315 / 7 = 45 bananas.

We already know that the first monkey eats 10 bananas and the second monkey eats 14 bananas each day. So, the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas.

The third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day, which is 45 - 24 = 21 bananas.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find out how many puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to determine how many pieces he placed in total and then subtract the pieces he placed before the hour. 

Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which is 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. 

Then, he finished another 500 piece puzzle. 

So, in total, he placed 250 + 500 = 750 pieces. 

Since he already placed 250 pieces before the hour, we subtract those from the total to find out how many pieces he placed during the hour: 750 - 250 = 500.

The final answer is: 500"
"To find out how much Jenny paid for the roses, we need to determine if she bought the roses by the dozen or individually. Since she bought 15 roses, it's more cost-effective for her to buy a dozen (12 roses) and 3 individual roses.

The cost of a dozen roses is $15. The cost of 3 individual roses is 3 * $2 = $6. So the total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with 5 $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25.

To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she paid with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 to quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

Jenny leaves with 16 quarters."
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the revenue from each item and then add them together.

The revenue from milkshakes is 6 * $5.50 = $33.
The revenue from burger platters is 9 * $11 = $99.
The revenue from sodas is 20 * $1.50 = $30.

Now, let's add the revenues together: $33 + $99 + $30 = $162.

The final answer is: $162"
"To find out how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time intervals between the trains and the time Paul needs to wait for the fourth train.

The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. Since Paul is at the station at time 0, he will wait for 145 minutes for his train.

The final answer is: 145"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far and then determine how many more weeks it will take her to reach 200 toothpicks.

Melanie saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. To find the total number of toothpicks she has saved, we multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week by the number of weeks:

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many more toothpicks Melanie needs to reach 200:

200 toothpicks (required) - 120 toothpicks (saved) = 80 toothpicks

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week, we can divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves per week to find out how many more weeks it will take her to collect 200 toothpicks:

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

So, Melanie will need 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we first need to determine the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and the price at which he sold it.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price, so the price he paid is 75% of $2000, which is 0.75 * $2000 = $1500.

Then, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is 1.2 * $1500 = $1800.

To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to find the difference between the original price and the price at which he bought it, and then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100.

The difference between the original price and the price at which Mr. Rogers' friend bought it is $2000 - $1800 = $200.

The percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is ($200 / $2000) * 100 = 10%.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours and then multiply it by the rate at which the springs create jellyfish.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute. So, the total number of seconds in 4 hours is:

60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since each spring creates a new jellyfish every second, the total number of jellyfish created by one spring in 14400 seconds is 14400.

Now, if we have 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created in 14400 seconds is:

14400 * 5 = 72000

So, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

The final answer is: 72000"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score. Binkie's score is 90, so twice that would be 2 * 90 = 180.

Since Frankie's score is 15 better than twice Binkie's, we need to add 15 to the result. Frankie's score = 180 + 15 = 195.

The final answer is: 195"
"To find the total time James spent walking, we need to calculate the total distance he walked and then divide it by his walking speed.

First, let's find the total distance James walked. He walked to the store and then back home, so the total distance is 2 times the distance from home to the store, which is 2 * 4 = 8 miles.

Next, we divide the total distance by James' walking speed to find the total time: 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours.

However, this is the total time for the round trip. Since James only wanted to know how long it took him to reach the store, we need to subtract the time it took him to walk back home. Since the distance to the store and back is the same, the time it took him to walk back home is also 2 hours. 

So, the time it took James to reach the store is 2 hours - 2 hours = 0 hours for the first half of the trip, then 2 hours to get back home, then 2 hours to get to the store.  0 + 2 + 2 = 4 hours.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much Jenny saved, we first need to calculate the total cost of buying the bananas individually and then compare it to the cost of buying them in bunches.

If Jenny buys 10 bunches with 4 bananas per bunch, she buys a total of 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

The cost of buying 10 bunches is $3.00 per bunch, so the total cost is 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find out how much she saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

So, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much fence each person gets. Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet of fence.

We know that the total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the rate of growth per year, we need to divide the growth in inches by the number of years. 

Growth per year = 8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year.

Now, we can multiply the growth per year by the total number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

Total growth = 2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

First, let's find the number of each type of bike sold:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150
- BMX bikes: 300 * 0.15 = 45
- MTB bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105

Now, let's calculate the revenue from each type of bike:
- Revenue from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- Revenue from BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250 (since BMX is half the price of MTB, which is $500, so BMX is $500 / 2 = $250)
- Revenue from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add up the revenue from all types of bikes:
$67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck, then subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

Now, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made: 30 - 18 = 12.

So, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field.

12"
"To find the total time John spends learning, we need to calculate the time spent in classes, and the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday.

First, let's calculate the time spent in classes. John takes 2 extra classes, each 40 minutes long, 5 days a week. 

Time spent in classes per day = 2 * 40 minutes = 80 minutes
Time spent in classes per week = 80 minutes * 5 days = 400 minutes

Now, let's calculate the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday. John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time. 

First, we need to find the total minutes in a week. There are 24 hours in a day, and 7 days in a week, so there are 24 * 7 = 168 hours in a week. 

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 168 * 60 = 10080 minutes in a week.

Now, we can find the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday. 

Extra time per week = 1/16 * 10080 minutes = 630 minutes

Now, we can find the total time spent learning per week. 

Total time spent learning per week = Time spent in classes per week + Extra time per week
Total time spent learning per week = 400 minutes + 630 minutes = 1030 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 

Total time spent learning per week = 1030 minutes / 60 = 17.17 hours

"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to first find the initial height from which it is dropped. Since the third floor is 24 feet high, and assuming the ground floor is 0 feet, the initial height is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

The ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height with each bounce. So, on the first bounce, it will reach a height of 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, it will reach a height of 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child in inches. 

The first child is 6 feet tall, which is 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The fourth child is 72 inches tall.

"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to determine the number of bags sold and then multiply that by the price per bag.

Since the orchard sold a total of 2000 apples and each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag to find the number of bags sold:

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now, we can multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag to find the total earnings:

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The final answer is: $1000"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the amount of meat left after the Allosaurus ate. 

The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. Before that, the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left. So, the amount of meat left after the velociraptors ate was twice the amount the Allosaurus ate, which is 2 * 270 = 540 kilograms.

Now, the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, and the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left. This means the velociraptors ate half of the remaining half, which is 1/4 of the original amount. So, the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate was 4 times the amount the velociraptors ate, which is 4 * 540 = 2160 kilograms.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the original amount of meat on the triceratops was twice the amount the T-Rex ate, which is 2 * 2160 = 4320 kilograms.

The final answer is: 4320"
"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted and then divide it by the coverage of a gallon of paint to find out how many gallons are needed. After that, we can multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon to get the total cost.

First, let's calculate the area of each wall:
- North wall: 10 x 8 = 80 square feet
- South wall: 10 x 8 = 80 square feet
- East wall: 5 x 8 = 40 square feet
- West wall: 5 x 8 = 40 square feet

Now, let's add up the areas of all the walls:
80 + 80 + 40 + 40 = 240 square feet

Since a gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, we need to divide the total area by 20 to find out how many gallons are needed:
240 / 20 = 12 gallons

Now, let's multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon to find the total cost:
12 gallons * $12/gallon = $144

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to determine the probability of her choosing a shaken can out of the remaining cans.

Initially, there were 12 sodas. Ellen shook 3 of them, so 9 were unshaken. She took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken and 3 shaken sodas. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas.

Now, the probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans. There are 2 shaken cans and 6 unshaken cans, making a total of 8 cans.

Probability = (Number of shaken cans) / (Total number of cans) = 2 / 8 = 0.25

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.25 * 100 = 25%

"To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we add the distances they've traveled to find the total distance between them: 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we first need to determine the number of days he works. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days (since April 19th is the last day). So, the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th is 31 + 19 = 50 days.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. To do this, we multiply 50 by 0.2: 50 * 0.2 = 10.

This means Billy takes 10 days off. So, the number of days he works is 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, which means he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

To find the total number of people he can help, we multiply the number of days he works by the number of people he can help per day: 40 * 6 = 240.

"To find the total number of people inside the church, we first need to calculate the total number of people that were transported by the buses and the cars. 

The number of people transported by the buses is the number of buses multiplied by the number of people each bus can carry: 12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people.

The number of people transported by the cars is the number of cars multiplied by the number of people each car can carry: 20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people.

The total number of people transported is the sum of the people transported by the buses and the cars: 420 people + 60 people = 480 people.

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the total number of people transported from the total number of people present (which is not given). However, we can infer that the total number of people present is the sum of the people inside the church and the people transported. 

Since we don't have the total number of people present, we can't calculate the exact number of people inside the church. However, we can express the number of people inside the church as the total number of people present minus the total number of people transported.

"To find Jeff's age, we first need to determine Martha's age. Since Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can calculate Martha's age by subtracting 4 from Mike's age.

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now that we know Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age since he is 10 years older than Martha.

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: time = length / speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide: time = length / speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide from the time it takes to ride the biggest slide: 
time_difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 x 15-minute breaks per day. 
Total time spent per day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 2 x 15 minutes (breaks) = 30 + 30 = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60. 
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunch and breaks. 
Total time spent in 5 days = 1 hour/day x 5 days = 5 hours

The total time spent on lunch and breaks after 5 days is 5 hours."
"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can multiply 8 by 3.5 to find out how many miles Micah ran.

8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now that we know Micah ran 28 miles, we can subtract the total miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles run by all three to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

Total miles run by all three = 52 miles
Miles run by Amber = 8 miles
Miles run by Micah = 28 miles
Miles run by Ahito = Total miles run by all three - (Miles run by Amber + Miles run by Micah)
Miles run by Ahito = 52 - (8 + 28)
Miles run by Ahito = 52 - 36
Miles run by Ahito = 16 miles

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total amount she spent after returning the item and then add that to the initial charge minus the returned item.

First, let's calculate the amount Sheila got back after returning the item:
$85.00 (initial charge) - $15.00 (returned item) = $70.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan:
The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage:
$20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00
Now, subtract the discount from the original price:
$20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

The cost of the frying pan is $16.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the set of towels:
The set of towels was 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage:
$30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00
Now, subtract the discount from the original price:
$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

The cost of the set of towels is $27.00.

Now, let's add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the amount Sheila got back after returning the item:
$70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue, so the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means x/15 = 6.

To find the total number of jellyfish, we can solve for x: x/15 = 6 => x = 6 * 15 = 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find Caroline's age, we need to determine Ben's age first, and then multiply it by 3.

Since Chris is 4 years old, and Ben is two times older than Chris, we can calculate Ben's age as follows:
Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben's age, we can find Caroline's age by multiplying Ben's age by 3:
Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate Lauren's total savings needed for retirement and then determine how many years she needs to work to achieve this goal.

First, let's calculate Lauren's annual expenses in retirement. Since she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, her annual expenses will be:

40% of $100,000 = 0.4 x $100,000 = $40,000

Since Lauren plans to live for 20 years in retirement, her total expenses will be:

$40,000 x 20 = $800,000

Next, we need to calculate Lauren's annual savings. Since she saves 20% of her salary, her annual savings will be:

20% of $100,000 = 0.2 x $100,000 = $20,000

Now, we need to calculate how many years Lauren needs to work to save $800,000 at a rate of $20,000 per year:

Number of years = Total savings / Annual savings
= $800,000 / $20,000
= 40 years

However, this is the total number of years Lauren needs to work to save for retirement, but we are asked how many more years she needs to work. Since we don't know how many years she has already worked, we will assume she has worked for x years. Therefore, the number of years she needs to work is the difference between the total number of years and the years she has already worked.

Since we don't know the number of years she has already worked, we will assume she has worked for 0 years. Therefore, the number of years she needs to work is:

40 years - 0 years = 40 years

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the length of each final cut, we first need to divide the total length of the ribbon by 4 to get the length of each of the initial cuts.

"To find the total population of the school, we can use the information given about the boys. Since 40% of the school population is 240 boys, we can set up the equation:

0.4x = 240

where x is the total population of the school.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

Now that we know the total population of the school is 600, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total population:

Number of girls = Total population - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items before applying the coupon. 

The cost of the set of pots is $19, and the cost of the sack of garden soil is $26. 

Total cost before coupon = cost of pots + cost of soil
Total cost before coupon = $19 + $26
Total cost before coupon = $45

Now, we need to subtract the coupon value from the total cost before coupon to get the final amount spent.

Final amount spent = Total cost before coupon - coupon value
Final amount spent = $45 - $7
Final amount spent = $38

"To find the average height of heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all heels and then divide by the total number of women.

The total number of women is 6 (3 wearing 4 inch heels and 3 wearing 2 inch heels).

The total height of heels for the women wearing 4 inch heels is 3 * 4 = 12 inches.
The total height of heels for the women wearing 2 inch heels is 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

The average height of heels is the total height of all heels divided by the total number of women, which is 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

The final answer is: 3"
"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Since Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days, we can calculate her daily target by dividing the total miles by the number of days:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Soledad is planning to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is a total of 250 miles per day. To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we subtract her planned daily miles from her target daily miles:

310 miles per day - 250 miles per day = 60 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total amount the store will receive after selling all the balls, we need to calculate the total revenue from each color of ball and then add them together.

The store has 3 red balls, each costing $9. So, the total revenue from red balls is 3 * $9 = $27.

The store has 11 blue balls, each costing $5. So, the total revenue from blue balls is 11 * $5 = $55.

The store has 25 green balls, each costing $3. So, the total revenue from green balls is 25 * $3 = $75.

Now, let's add the revenue from all the balls together: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157.

The store will receive a total of $157 after selling all the balls.

The final answer is: $157"
"To find out how much James will have left, we first need to determine how much Pierre and Paul will take. 

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg. 

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

So, Pierre and Paul will take 3 + 4 = 7 kg in total.

Since there are three people (Pierre, Paul, and Jacques), and we know that Pierre and Paul will take 7 kg, we can assume that Jacques will take the remaining amount. 

The total amount of apples is 12 kg, and Pierre and Paul will take 7 kg, so Jacques will have 12 - 7 = 5 kg.

"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the amount he initially had, and then add the amount he saved.

Raymond initially had $21. He saved $11, so we add that to his initial amount: $21 + $11 = $32.

Then, he spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle, so we subtract the total amount he spent from the new total: $32 - ($5 + $19) = $32 - $24 = $8.

So, Raymond has $8 left.

"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first determine how much Anna spent on the books. We know she had a budget of $16 and had $2 left, so she spent $16 - $2 = $14 on the books.

Since she bought 2 books and they cost the same amount of money, we can divide the total amount spent by 2 to find the cost of each book. 

Cost of each book = Total amount spent / Number of books
Cost of each book = $14 / 2
Cost of each book = $7

The final answer is: $7"

"To find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we need to first find the rate at which the light blinks per minute. 

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. To find the rate per minute, we divide the number of blinks by the time in minutes: 255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute.

Now that we know the rate per minute, we can find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times by dividing the total number of blinks by the rate per minute: 459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute.

459 / 51 = 9 minutes.

Additional male goldfishes: 2
Total male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5

Initial female goldfishes: 5
Additional female goldfishes: 3
Total female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's find the total number of male and female fishes.
Total male fishes: 6 (guppies) + 5 (goldfishes) = 11
Total female fishes: 8 (guppies) + 8 (goldfishes) = 16

To find the difference between the number of female and male fishes, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes.
Difference: 16 (female fishes) - 11 (male fishes) = 5

"To find out how many miles Brian will walk in 7 days, we first need to determine how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we multiply 10 miles by 7 days.

10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we can set up an equation where Brian's distance is half of Sofie's distance. 

Let x be Brian's distance in 7 days. 
x = 70 miles / 2

x = 35 miles

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers and then find out how many toys the fifth worker must produce to meet the remaining demand.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour. Since they work for 10 hours, they produce a total of 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys.

Next, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the other 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour. Since they work for 10 hours, they produce a total of 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys.

Now, let's add the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers: 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to meet the order, the total number of toys needed is 400. The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 200, so the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker is 400 - 200 = 200 toys.

Since the fifth worker works for 10 hours, we can find out how many toys they produce per hour by dividing the total number of toys produced by the number of hours worked: 200 / 10 = 20 toys per hour.

"To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we first need to find the weight of each of his dogs. 

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/4 to find the weight of Elijah's first dog: 60 * (1/4) = 15 pounds.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/2 to find the weight of Elijah's second dog: 60 * (1/2) = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of Elijah's two dogs to find the total weight of his dogs: 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

To find the total weight of all three dogs, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs: 60 + 45 = 105 pounds.

The final answer is: 105"
"To solve this problem, let's work backwards from the information given.

Kris had 7 stickers left after giving some to Rob. Kris had 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob, so Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers before giving any to Rob.

Luis gave the rest of the stickers to Kris, and Kris had 16 stickers. This means Luis had 16 + 7 = 23 stickers before giving any to Kris.

Luis used half of the stickers and gave the rest to Kris. This means Luis had 23 stickers and gave half of them to Kris. Half of 23 is 11.5, but since you can't give half a sticker, we'll assume Luis had an even number of stickers. Let's try 22 stickers. Half of 22 is 11, which is a whole number.

So, Luis had 22 stickers before giving any to Kris. 

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Luis had 22 stickers, so Seth must have given him 22 * 2 = 44 stickers.

"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to calculate the total weight of the M&M's and then multiply it by the number of M&M's per ounce. 

First, let's find the total weight of the M&M's: 3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces.

Since an ounce of M&M's has 30 M&M's, the total number of M&M's is 30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's.

Now, we need to find out how many small bags John can make. Each small bag contains 10 M&M's, so we divide the total number of M&M's by 10: 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per small bag = 90 small bags.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to first calculate half of the circumference of the earth. 

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of that would be 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers. We know that Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. 

To find the number of days, we can divide the total distance (20,000 kilometers) by the distance Alfie flies per day (400 kilometers). 

20,000 / 400 = 50 days.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of the 2nd fastest car first, and then use that to find the speed of the fastest car.

Given that the average car can go 120 miles per hour, and the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, we can calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car as follows:

Speed of 2nd fastest car = 5 * Speed of average car
= 5 * 120
= 600 miles per hour

Now, we know that the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. We can calculate the speed of the fastest car as follows:

Speed of fastest car = 1.25 * Speed of 2nd fastest car
= 1.25 * 600
= 750 miles per hour

The final answer is: 750"
"To find Vince's current age, we first need to determine Liam's age two years ago. Since Liam is 16 now, two years ago he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince, so we can set up the equation: 14 = 2 * Vince's age two years ago.

To find Vince's age two years ago, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: Vince's age two years ago = 14 / 2 = 7.

Since we want to find Vince's current age, we need to add 2 to his age two years ago: Vince's current age = 7 + 2 = 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so let's call this number A. 
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's call the number of eggs Sarah painted S. Then, Camden painted S + 12 eggs.
3. Since Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, we can write the equation: S + (S + 12) = 30.
4. Simplifying the equation, we get 2S + 12 = 30.
5. Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get 2S = 18.
6. Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 9. So, Sarah painted 9 eggs.
7. Since Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.
8. We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. So, the total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline is 56 - 30 = 26.
9. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, each of them painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.
10. Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs. So, Camden painted 21 - 13 = 8 more eggs than Arnold.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we first need to find the total number of boxes and the total weight of the crayons. 

Since Nik wants to put the crayons into groups of 8, we can divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find the number of boxes: 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is equal to the total number of crayons: 200 ounces.

Each box weighs 8 ounces, and there are 25 boxes, so the total weight of the boxes is 8 * 25 = 200 ounces.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is the sum of their weights: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the total weight from ounces to pounds by dividing by 16: 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much John makes, we first need to determine how many logs he can make from the tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we calculate 80% of 80 feet.

80% of 80 feet = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet long, we divide the total length of the usable tree by the length of each log to find out how many logs he can make.

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

From each log, he cuts 5 planks. So, we multiply the number of logs by the number of planks per log.

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

He sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we first need to determine the monthly earnings of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of what her brother earns. So, her brother's monthly earnings are 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is 2 * ($5000 + $10,000) = 2 * $15,000 = $30,000.

Now, we add up their monthly earnings to find the total amount of money they all have together: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Grandma's speed on the beach and on the sidewalk. 

Let's denote Grandma's speed on the beach as 'x' miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. The time taken to walk 2 miles on the beach is 2/x, and the time taken to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is 1/(2x).

We are given that 40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach. This means that 2/x = 40/60 (converting 40 minutes to hours for uniformity). 

Solving for x, we get x = 2/40 * 60 = 3 miles per minute.

Now, we know that her speed on the sidewalk is 2x = 2 * 3 = 6 miles per minute.

The time taken to walk 2 miles on the beach is 2/3 = 40/60 minutes, which is given. The time taken to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is 1/6 minutes.

The total time taken to complete the entire 3-mile walk is 40/60 + 1/6. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 60. 

40/60 + 10/60 = 50/60 = 5/6 hours. 

To convert 5/6 hours to minutes, we multiply by 60: 5/6 * 60 = 50 minutes.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take Jane to save a total of $60, we first need to calculate how much she has saved so far. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount saved is 4 * 8 = $32.

Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60. This is 60 - 32 = $28.

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings to find out how many more weeks it will take: 28 / 4 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to calculate the number of blue birds in each group of trees and then add them together.

First, we have 3 trees with 7 blue birds each, so the total number of blue birds in these trees is 3 * 7 = 21.

Next, we have 2 trees with 4 blue birds each, so the total number of blue birds in these trees is 2 * 4 = 8.

Finally, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the number of blue birds in each group together: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many marbles Bob originally had. We know that if he receives 2 dozen (24) more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. 

Let's denote the original number of marbles as x. Then, the equation can be set up as follows:

x + 24 = 60

To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 24 from both sides:

x = 60 - 24
x = 36

So, Bob originally had 36 marbles. Now, if he loses 10 marbles, we need to subtract 10 from 36 to find out how many marbles he will have left:

36 - 10 = 26

The final answer is: 26"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature of the second bottle of water. 

Let's denote the temperature of the second bottle as x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle into his water bottle, the total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces. 

Since the temperature of the mixture is at least 40 degrees, we can set up the following equation:

(33 * 4 + x * 1) / 5 >= 40

Simplifying the equation:

132 + x >= 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x >= 68

So, the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of cows. Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 21 days in three weeks. 

Number of cows added in three weeks = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of cows = Initial number of cows + Number of cows added
Total number of cows = 50 + 420
Total number of cows = 470

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens. Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. 

Number of chickens added in three weeks = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
Total number of chickens = Initial number of chickens + Number of chickens added
Total number of chickens = 20 + 210
Total number of chickens = 230

Now, let's add the total number of cows and chickens to find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks.

Total number of animals = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens
Total number of animals = 470 + 230
Total number of animals = 700

"To find the cost of each single bagel, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels with the 10% discount. 

The original cost of 4 packs of bagels is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00. 

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $40.00. 
10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the original cost to get the discounted cost. 
Discounted cost = Original cost - Discount = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Since each pack has 9 bagels, the total number of bagels in 4 packs is 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the discounted cost by the total number of bagels. 
Cost per bagel = Discounted cost / Total number of bagels = $36.00 / 36 = $1.00

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate, we first need to determine how many scoops 1 less than 3 scoops is. 3 scoops minus 1 is 2 scoops.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops, so it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops.

Since Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops, he ate 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate. Since it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops, we need to find out how many sets of 2 scoops are in 18 scoops. 18 / 2 = 9 sets of 2 scoops. 

Since each set of 2 scoops requires 3 potatoes, we multiply the number of sets by the number of potatoes per set: 9 * 3 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, and then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days is 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester increases his egg consumption to 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days is 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

Now, we add the total number of eggs from both periods: 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens: 240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen eggs.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to determine the total number of red jellybeans. We know there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans. 

So, the number of red jellybeans = 2 * 17 = 34.

We also know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can find the total number of green and red jellybeans by adding the number of green and red jellybeans together. 

Total green and red jellybeans = 17 (green) + 34 (red) = 51.

Now, we can find the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans.

Number of blue jellybeans = Total jellybeans - Total green and red jellybeans
= 60 - 51

"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the total number of lemons he collects in one year and then multiply it by 10.

First, let's find the total number of lemons he collects in one year. He has 5 trees and each tree gives him 6 lemons per year. 

Total lemons per year = Number of trees * Lemons per tree per year
Total lemons per year = 5 * 6
Total lemons per year = 30

Now, we multiply the total lemons per year by 10 to find the total lemons in a decade.

Total lemons in a decade = Total lemons per year * 10
Total lemons in a decade = 30 * 10
Total lemons in a decade = 300

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women on the bus initially. 

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can let the number of men be 5x and the number of women be 9x. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the equation: 5x + 9x = 84. 

Combine like terms: 14x = 84. 

Divide both sides by 14: x = 6. 

Now that we know x, we can find the number of women on the bus initially: 9x = 9 * 6 = 54. 

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining is: 54 - 20 = 34.

"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we need to first determine how many bouquets he sold. We know that each bouquet has 12 sunflowers and costs $8. 

Faraday earned $56 from the bouquets per day. To find out how many bouquets he sold, we can divide the total earnings from bouquets by the cost of each bouquet: $56 / $8 = 7 bouquets per day.

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers sold from bouquets per day is 7 * 12 = 84 sunflowers.

We also know that Faraday earned $26 from the sunflowers per day. Since each sunflower costs $2, we can find out how many sunflowers he sold per day by dividing the total earnings from sunflowers by the cost of each sunflower: $26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers per day.

To find the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days, we add the sunflowers sold from bouquets and the sunflowers sold individually: 84 + 13 * 3 = 84 + 39 = 123 sunflowers.

The final answer is: 123"
"To find out how much money Adam loses, we first need to determine how many rocks he can buy with his $100. 

Since each rock costs $5, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of each rock: 

$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Adam can buy 20 rocks. 

Now, let's calculate how much money he can make by selling 60% of his inventory. 

60% of 20 rocks is 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks.

Since he sells each rock for $7, the total amount of money he makes is: 

12 rocks * $7 = $84

However, Adam invested all his money in the rock stand, which is $100. To find out how much he loses, we subtract the money he made from the initial investment:

$100 - $84 = $16

Adam loses $16.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene. 

First, let's find the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene:

- Large-sized picture scenes: 45 / 5 = 9 days
- Medium-sized picture scenes: 36 / 6 = 6 days
- Small-sized picture scenes: 49 / 7 = 7 days

Now, we need to find the LCM of 9, 6, and 7. 

The prime factorization of 6 is 2 * 3.
The prime factorization of 7 is 7.
The prime factorization of 9 is 3^2.

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:
- The highest power of 2 is 2^1 (from 6).
- The highest power of 3 is 3^2 (from 9).
- The highest power of 7 is 7^1 (from 7).

The LCM is 2^1 * 3^2 * 7^1 = 2 * 9 * 7 = 126.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many seashells Carrey collected first. Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as 'x'. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, Carlos collected 2x seashells. We are given that Jim collected 5 more than Carlos, so Jim collected 2x + 5 seashells.

We know that the total number of seashells collected is the sum of the seashells collected by each person: x + 2x + (2x + 5) = 5x + 5.

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, the total number of seashells (5x + 5) must be divisible by 3 (the number of people). To find the value of x, we need to find the least value of x that makes 5x + 5 divisible by 3.

Let's try x = 2: 5(2) + 5 = 15, which is divisible by 3.

Now that we know x = 2, we can find the number of seashells each person collected:
- Carrey collected x = 2 seashells.
- Carlos collected 2x = 2(2) = 4 seashells.
- Jim collected 2x + 5 = 2(2) + 5 = 9 seashells.

To find out how many seashells each person got when they divided them equally, we divide the total number of seashells (15) by 3: 15 / 3 = 5.

Isabel's height = 7 feet
Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
Ned's height = 7 - 2
Ned's height = 5 feet

Since Carl is one foot taller than Ned, we can calculate Carl's height as follows:
Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 + 1
Carl's height = 6 feet

We are given that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. To find the length of the cane, we can divide Carl's height by 2:

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles required to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

Since each bottle covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand, we need to find out how many bottles are required to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand. 

100% / 20% = 5 bottles per person

Now, we multiply the number of people by the number of bottles per person to get the total number of bottles required to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

2300 people * 5 bottles/person = 11500 bottles

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles it needs to produce to meet the demand of 11500 bottles.

11500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 7300 bottles

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how many babies are wearing purple and how many are wearing blue. Since Carla has 8 babies and 3/4 of them are wearing purple, we can calculate the number of purple babies as follows:

Number of purple babies = 3/4 * 8 = 6

Since the remaining 1/4 are wearing blue, we can calculate the number of blue babies as follows:

Number of blue babies = 1/4 * 8 = 2

Next, we need to find out how many babies are wearing bows. We know that all the blue babies and 1/3 of the purple babies are wearing bows. So, the number of purple babies wearing bows is:

Number of purple babies wearing bows = 1/3 * 6 = 2

The total number of babies wearing bows is the sum of the blue babies and the purple babies wearing bows:

Total number of babies wearing bows = 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This can be calculated by dividing the number of purple babies wearing bows by the total number of babies wearing bows, and then multiplying by 100:

Now, let's find the total number of reports received on Wednesday by subtracting the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday. However, we need to subtract the reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total reports received last week to get the reports received on Wednesday.

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received last week - (Reports received on Monday and Tuesday + Reports received on Thursday and Friday)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Reports received on Wednesday = 1125

The final answer is: 1125"
"To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the amount of money he earned from each sale and add them together.

First, Abraham sold half of his land for $50. Since he owns 80 square meters, half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. 

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Since he owns 80 square meters, 1/4 of that is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters. 

Now, let's calculate the amount of land he has left. He started with 80 square meters, sold 40 square meters, and then sold 20 square meters. So, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left.

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, the amount of money he earned from selling the remaining land is 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, let's add up the money he earned from each sale: $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find Geb's age, we need to first calculate half of Haley's age. Haley is 26 years old, so half of that would be 26 / 2 = 13.

Since Geb is 10 less than half of Haley's age, we need to subtract 10 from 13. 

13 - 10 = 3

Geb is 3 years old."
"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to first determine how many face masks he uses in a day. 

Since Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out and he goes out three times a day, the total number of face masks he uses in a day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, to find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses in a day by 2. 

6 * 2 = 12

So, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. Since a dozen is 12, we can calculate the total number of eggs as 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs, so the remaining number of eggs is 36 - 5 = 31.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, which means she finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs. Now, the remaining number of eggs is 31 - 10 = 21.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so he finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Now, the remaining number of eggs is 21 - 8 = 13.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, which means she finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs. Now, the remaining number of eggs is 13 - 4 = 9.

Therefore, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is 9."
"To find the total amount of money John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments and the total number of collections.

First, let's find the total number of apartments in the first two complexes: 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400. 

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. 
So, the last complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

The total number of apartments is 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections per week is 3 * 3 = 9 collections.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment, so the total amount of money he makes per collection is 0.40 * 1040 = $416.

Since he makes 9 collections per week, the total amount of money he makes in a week is 416 * 9 = $3744.

The final answer is: $3744"
"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree, we need to calculate the fruits produced each year and add them up.

- Year 1: 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
- Year 2: 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, so 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- Year 3: 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, so 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- Year 4: The tree is now 8 years old, but we don't have information about its production. However, we know that an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We'll come back to this later.
- Year 5: The tree is now 9 years old, but we don't have information about its production. 
- Year 6: The tree is now 10 years old, but we don't have information about its production yet.
- Year 7: The tree is now 11 years old, but we don't have information about its production.
- Year 8: The tree is now 12 years old, but we don't have information about its production.
- Year 9: The tree is now 13 years old, but we don't have information about its production.
- Year 10: The tree is now 14 years old, but we don't have information about its production yet.

However, we know that a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, let's go back to the information about the 8-year-old tree. We know that it produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Since a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits, an 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Now that we have the production for all the years, we can add them up:

Year 1: 50
Year 2: 150
Year 3: 350
Year 4: 800
Year 5: 0 (no production)
Year 6: 0 (no production)
Year 7: 0 (no production)
Year 8: 0 (no production)
Year 9: 0 (no production)
Year 10: 1000

Total fruits = 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

The final answer is: 2350"
"To find out how much money Jack has now, we need to calculate the amount Sophia gave him and add it to his initial amount.

Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100. To find 1/5 of $100, we multiply $100 by 1/5, which is the same as dividing $100 by 5.

$100 / 5 = $20

So, Sophia gave Jack $20. 

Now, we add the $20 to Jack's initial $100.

$100 + $20 = $120

Jack now has $120."
"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R. We are given that R = 4B and B = Y - 7.

We can express Y in terms of B: Y = B + 7.

We are also given that R + B + Y = 37. Substituting R = 4B and Y = B + 7 into this equation, we get:

4B + B + B + 7 = 37

Combine like terms: 6B + 7 = 37

Subtract 7 from both sides: 6B = 30

Divide both sides by 6: B = 5

Now that we know B, we can find R: R = 4B = 4 * 5 = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume Ronnie was given $5. Since Rissa was given thrice as much, Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

After each of them gave an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's call the amount they gave 'x'. So, Ronnie is left with $5 - x and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

We are given that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money. This means (15 - x) = (4/5) * 15.

To find the value of x, we can solve the equation: 
(15 - x) = (4/5) * 15
15 - x = 12
x = 3

Now that we know x, we can find out how much money Ronnie is left with:
Ronnie's money left = $5 - x
= $5 - 3
= $2

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that there are four colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow. We also know that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint. Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as 'x'. 

Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, which is the sum of the red, white, purple, and yellow paint. We can write this as an equation: x + x + x + 6 = 12.

Combine like terms: 3x + 6 = 12.

Subtract 6 from both sides: 3x = 6.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 2.

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, the amount of red paint used is x = 2 pints.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, then add them together.

First, let's find the area of one bedroom: 
Area of one bedroom = length * width = 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms = 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area = 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas together: 
Total area = area of bedrooms + area of living room + area of the rest of the house
Total area = 960 + 1200 + 1000
Total area = 3160 square feet.

The final answer is: 3160"
"To find the total number of clouds Alice counted, we need to calculate the number of clouds for each day and add them up.

On Monday, Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.

On Tuesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Monday, which is 2 * 3 = 6 clouds.

On Wednesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.

On Thursday, she counts double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.

On Friday, she counts double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add up the number of clouds for each day: 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93.

"To find the number of pods in the new box, we need to calculate 20% of 100 and add it to 100. 

20% of 100 is 0.2 * 100 = 20. 
So, the new box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Since each pod costs $0.12 (12 dollars divided by 100 pods), we can calculate the cost per cycle as $0.12.

Now, we need to find out how many cycles we can run for $1. To do this, we divide $1 by the cost per cycle: $1 / $0.12 = 8.33.

Since we can't run a fraction of a cycle, we round down to the nearest whole number. 

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. This means he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which means he uses 40 / 2 = 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, tripling his money means each bill is now worth $60. So, he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills, but each is worth $60.

5. To find the total amount of money he has, we multiply the number of bills by the value of each bill: 60 * $60 = $3600.

6. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find the number of 5 dollar bills, we divide the total amount of money by the value of each 5 dollar bill: $3600 / $5 = 720.

The final answer is: 720"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals.

Now, let's find out how many goals team A scored in the second half. It's given that team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half. So, team A scores 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals in the second half.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team in the match. Team A scored 4 goals in the first half and 2 goals in the second half, so the total number of goals scored by team A is 4 + 2 = 6.

Team B scored 2 goals in the first half and 8 goals in the second half, so the total number of goals scored by team B is 2 + 8 = 10.

The total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by team A and team B, which is 6 + 10 = 16.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much chalk the teacher has left after Monday and then determine how many days it will last.

The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. He uses 45% of it on Monday, so we need to find 45% of 5 inches.

45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

This means the teacher has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk left after Monday.

Now, we need to find out how many days the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk will last when the teacher uses 20% of it each day.

Let's assume the number of days the chalk will last is 'x'. Then, 20% of 2.75 inches will be used each day.

0.20 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches per day

Since the teacher starts with 2.75 inches, we can set up the equation:

2.75 = 0.55x

To solve for 'x', we divide both sides by 0.55:

x = 2.75 / 0.55
x = 5

"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to find the total number of students on varsity. 

One-third of the girls are on varsity, so the number of girls on varsity is 12 * (1/3) = 4. 
One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so the number of boys on varsity is 12 * (1/4) = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 (boys) + 12 (girls) = 24.

The number of students not on varsity is 24 (total students) - 7 (students on varsity) = 17.

"To find the total cost of the milk, we first need to calculate the total amount Mr. Marcellus paid for the milk. 

Total gallons of milk = 4000
Cost per gallon = $3.5
Total cost = Total gallons of milk * Cost per gallon
Total cost = 4000 * $3.5
Total cost = $14,000

Since 2/5 of the milk was expired, we need to find the amount of expired milk. 

Amount of expired milk = (2/5) * Total gallons of milk
Amount of expired milk = (2/5) * 4000
Amount of expired milk = 1600 gallons

The company will refund the cost of the expired milk. 

Refund = Amount of expired milk * Cost per gallon
Refund = 1600 * $3.5

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Colin's current age as C and Wendy's current age as W.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:

C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:

20 = C

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we first need to determine the total number of books he can buy with $27000. 

Since he can buy 100 books for $500, we can find the total number of books by dividing the total amount spent ($27000) by the cost per 100 books ($500).

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost per 100 books
Total number of books = $27000 / $500
Total number of books = 54

Now that we know Bob can buy a total of 54 books, we can find out how many books he can buy per school by dividing the total number of books by the number of schools (3).

Books per school = Total number of books / Number of schools
Books per school = 54 / 3
Books per school = 18

"Let's break down the events step by step:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree, and one landed on Newton's head. So, Newton had 2 apples.
2. He picked up the two apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 new apples, making a total of 6 apples.
3. He put all but one of the new apples in his pocket, leaving 1 apple on the ground. So, he now has 6 (in his pocket) + 1 (on the ground) = 7 apples.
4. He threw the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 7 apples (in his pocket) + 6 new apples (on the ground) = 13 apples.
5. He picked up all the remaining apples, which are the 6 that fell out after throwing the apple at the tree. So, he now has 13 apples in total.

Therefore, Newton brought home 13 apples.

"To find out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza is needed for. 

For the cheese pizza, each of Kate's 6 friends eats 6 slices, so the total number of cheese pizza slices needed is 6 friends * 6 slices = 36 slices. 

For the pepperoni pizza, each of Kate's 6 friends eats 4 slices, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices needed is 6 friends * 4 slices = 24 slices.

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to find the total number of each type of pizza needed. 

For the cheese pizza, 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas. 

For the pepperoni pizza, 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas.

Since Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, she needs a total of 3 + 3 = 6 pizzas.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the net rate at which Jay is building snowballs. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 20 / 60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute. 

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, which is equivalent to 2 / 15 = 2/15 snowballs per minute.

The net rate at which Jay is building snowballs is the difference between the rate at which he builds them and the rate at which they melt. 

Net rate = 1/3 - 2/15 
To find the common denominator, we multiply the numerator and denominator of 1/3 by 5 to get 5/15. 
Net rate = 5/15 - 2/15 
Net rate = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Now, we need to find how long it will take Jay to build 60 snowballs at a rate of 1/5 snowballs per minute. 

Time = Total number of snowballs / Net rate 
Time = 60 / (1/5) 
Time = 60 * 5 
Time = 300 minutes.

However, we need to consider the initial 15 minutes in which 2 snowballs melt. 

So, the total time will be 300 minutes + 15 minutes = 315 minutes.

"To find Jim's age, we need to first determine John's age 20 years ago. Since John is 28 now, we subtract 20 from his current age to find his age at the time of the Digimon release.

John's age 20 years ago = 28 - 20 = 8

Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we can set up an equation to find Jim's age at that time:

John's age 20 years ago = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago
8 = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago

To find Jim's age 20 years ago, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Jim's age 20 years ago = 8 / 2
Jim's age 20 years ago = 4

Now, we need to find Jim's current age by adding 20 to his age 20 years ago:

Jim's current age = Jim's age 20 years ago + 20
Jim's current age = 4 + 20
Jim's current age = 24

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as 'x'. 

On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50. So, the remaining bandages after the first day are x - 38.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The remaining bandages after the second day are (x - 38) - 28.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. The remaining bandages after the third day are ((x - 38) - 28) - 25 + 100.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation:

((x - 38) - 28) - 25 + 100 = 78

Simplifying the equation:

x - 38 - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78
x - 91 + 100 = 78
x + 9 = 78
x = 69

The initial number of bandages is 69.

"To find Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her regular pay and her attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay. She works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week, and there are 4 weeks in April. 

Total hours worked in a week = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week
Total hours worked in April = 45 hours/week * 4 weeks = 180 hours

Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her total regular pay for April is:
Total regular pay = 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since Jen has complete attendance for the month, she receives an additional $10 for the attendance bonus. 

Total earnings = Total regular pay + Attendance bonus
Total earnings = $270 + $10
Total earnings = $280

"To find the total amount Jason earned, we need to calculate the earnings for each task and then add them up.

For the dishwasher, Jason emptied it 6 times at $0.50 per time, so his earnings from the dishwasher are 6 * $0.50 = $3.00.

For the laundry, Jason did it once at $3.00, so his earnings from the laundry are $3.00.

For the trash, Jason took it out twice at $0.75 per time, so his earnings from the trash are 2 * $0.75 = $1.50.

For the room, Jason cleaned it once at $1.50, so his earnings from the room are $1.50.

Now, let's add up all the earnings: $3.00 (dishwasher) + $3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (trash) + $1.50 (room) = $8.00.

"To find the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we first need to find the amount of blood in one shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, a shark has 3 * 40 = 120 gallons of blood.

Now, we need to find the total amount of blood in ten sharks. To do this, we multiply the amount of blood in one shark by the number of sharks: 120 * 10 = 1200 gallons.

The final answer is: 1200"
"To find the total number of people who entered the restaurant, we need to calculate the number of people who entered at each time and add them up.

First, 50 people entered in the morning. 
Then, 40 more people entered at 10:00. 
Next, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. 
Finally, 3 times the number of people who entered in the morning came in, which is 3 * 50 = 150 people.

Now, let's add up the number of people who entered at each time: 
50 (morning) + 40 (10:00) + 80 (lunch) + 150 (evening) = 320

The total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we first need to determine the number of red pens and black pens. 

Since Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens and each pack has 5 pens, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

It's mentioned that Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. So, the number of black pens is 2 * 25 = 50 black pens.

To find the total number of pens, we add the number of red pens and black pens: 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

The final answer is: 75"
"To find the total cost, we first need to determine the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. To find the cost per bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles: $600 / 10 = $60 per bottle.

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cognac costs 50% more than the scotch, so the cost per bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $90.

Now, we can find the total cost of the cognac: 20 bottles * $90 per bottle = $1800.

The total cost of everything is the sum of the cost of the scotch and the cognac: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. He also planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which means he planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it a total of 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. For Lodgepole Pine, he planted 1/4 more than the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted in the two days. The total White Oak trees planted is 30, and the total Lodgepole Pine trees planted is 50. 

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 30 + 50 = 80."
"To find out how much root beer was available for each person to drink, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer remaining after all the incidents. 

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer. 

On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed by his children. So, the remaining amount is 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled. So, the remaining amount is 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.

On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed by Ronnie. So, the remaining amount is 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, and they shared the remaining root beer equally. To find out how much each person got, we need to divide the remaining amount by the number of people. 

8 gallons / 3 people = 2.67 gallons per person.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.67}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as 'x'. 

The problem states that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as an equation: 4x + 8 = 40.

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable 'x'. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation: 4x = 40 - 8.

This simplifies to: 4x = 32.

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for 'x': x = 32 / 4.

x = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we need to calculate one-third of the total number of fish. 

One-third of 66 is 66 / 3 = 22.

Now, we need to find the number of fish that do not have red stripes. Since 22 fish have red stripes, the remaining fish are 66 - 22 = 44.

Now, we need to find 5/11 of the remaining fish that have blue stripes. 

5/11 of 44 is (5/11) * 44 = 20.

So, the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is 22 + 20 = 42.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Amy had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors from the palettes.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 eyeshadow colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister stole one of the palettes, which means Amy lost 4 eyeshadow colors (since each palette has 4 colors).

Now, Amy has 26 - 4 = 22 eyeshadow colors left.

Amy then uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set has 6 eyeshadow colors, half of that is 6 / 2 = 3 eyeshadow colors.

So, Amy uses up 3 eyeshadow colors from the makeup set.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

The final answer is: 19"
"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know Mattison's height is 60 inches. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is, so the total height of the two-story house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

Since the first floor's floor to ceiling height is thrice as high as Mattison's height, the first floor's height is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Now, to find the height of the second floor, we subtract the first floor's height from the total height of the two-story house: 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is the same as the height of the first floor, which is 180 inches.

The final answer is: 180"
"To find the number of shells found by team Alphas, we need to calculate 40% of 700. 

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells remaining after team Alphas found their share. 

Remaining shells = Total shells - Shells found by Alphas
= 700 - 280
= 420 shells.

Next, we need to find the number of shells found by team The finders, which is 60% of the remaining shells.

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells found by team Gogetters. 

Shells found by Gogetters = Total shells - (Shells found by Alphas + Shells found by The finders)
= 700 - (280 + 252)
= 700 - 532
= 168 shells.

The final answer is: 168"
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we first need to calculate the total miles all the dogs need to walk in a day. Since there are 4 dogs and they need to walk an average of 3 miles per day, the total miles they need to walk is 4 * 3 = 12 miles.

Now, let's add up the miles the first three dogs need to walk: 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the miles the first three dogs need to walk from the total miles: 12 - 8 = 4 miles.

The last dog needs to walk 4 miles."
"To find out how much money John got from the loan, we need to calculate 40% of the value of his house. 

40% of $250,000 = 0.4 * $250,000 = $100,000

Now, John uses 60% of this amount to pay off his debts. 

60% of $100,000 = 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000

This means John paid off $60,000 of his debt. To find out how much money he has leftover, we subtract this amount from the loan amount.

$100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

So, John has $40,000 leftover after paying off his debt.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To find the total weight of the tunas caught, we need to add the weights of all three tunas. 

Weight of the first tuna = 56 kilograms
Weight of the second tuna = 46 kilograms
Weight of the last tuna = 26 kilograms

Total weight of the tunas = 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we can multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Total weight of the tunas * Cost per kilogram
Total earnings = 128 * 0.50
Total earnings = 64

The final answer is: $64"
"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first find the selling price of the magazines. 

The cost price of the magazines is $72. Trinity sells the magazines at 11/8 of the cost price. 

To find the selling price, we multiply the cost price by 11/8:
Selling price = (11/8) * 72
Selling price = (11 * 72) / 8
Selling price = 792 / 8
Selling price = 99

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:
Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

The final answer is: $27"
"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed by each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed by the low setting is 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 liters of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed by the medium setting is 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 4 liters of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total amount of water removed by the high setting is 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

Now, we add the total amount of water removed by each setting: 3 liters (low) + 6 liters (medium) + 20 liters (high) = 29 liters.

The final answer is: 29"
"To find out how many balloons were thrown, we need to first calculate the total number of balloons Jolene and her friends had initially. 

They filled up 10 packs of balloons with 30 balloons per pack, so the total number of balloons is 10 * 30 = 300.

Since 12 balloons were left by the end of the afternoon, we subtract these from the total to find out how many were thrown. 

300 - 12 = 288

So, 288 balloons were thrown."
"To find the total amount of the second medicine, we need to calculate 3 times the amount of the first medicine. 

The first medicine is 14 mL, so 3 times that amount is 3 * 14 = 42 mL.

Now, we need to find the total amount of both medicines in one dose. The first medicine is 14 mL, and the second medicine is 42 mL, so the total amount in one dose is 14 + 42 = 56 mL.

To find the total amount in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8. 

56 mL * 8 = 448 mL.

The final answer is: 448"
"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we first need to determine the capacity of John's school. 

Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we can find the capacity of one of John's classes by multiplying Ali's class capacity by 1/8. 

Capacity of one of John's classes = 120 * (1/8) = 15 students

Since John has two classes, we multiply the capacity of one class by 2 to find the total capacity of John's school.

Capacity of John's school = 15 * 2 = 30 students

Now, we add the capacity of Ali's school (which is 120 students) to the capacity of John's school to find the combined capacity of both schools.

Combined capacity = 120 + 30 = 150

The final answer is: 150"
"To find the total amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we first need to calculate the total interest he owes his sister. 

The interest is 2% of the initial $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6. 

However, Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount he pays in the first 11 months is 25 * 11 = $275.

The remaining amount, including the interest, will be paid in the twelfth month. This remaining amount is the initial $300 (the amount he borrowed) plus the interest ($6), minus the total amount he paid in the first 11 months ($275). 

So, the amount he will pay in the twelfth month is 300 + 6 - 275 = $31.

The final answer is: $31"
"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we first need to determine the total number of diaper changes required for both children. Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and there are 2 children, the total number of diaper changes is 2 * 5 = 10.

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, we need to find out how many diapers she changes. Half of 10 is 5, so Jordan's wife changes 5 diapers per day.

To find out how many diapers Jordan changes, we subtract the number of diapers his wife changes from the total number of diaper changes. So, 10 - 5 = 5.

Therefore, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we first need to calculate the volume of the jar. The jar has a square base with a side length of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the jar) is given by the formula V = lwh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.

Given that the base is square, the length and width are the same, so we can calculate the volume as V = 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans have a volume of 0.15 cubic inches, we can calculate the total number of jelly beans in the jar by dividing the volume of the jar by the volume of a single jelly bean. However, we need to account for the packing efficiency, which is 80%. This means that the actual number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar is 80% of the calculated number.

First, let's calculate the total number of jelly beans without considering the packing efficiency: 540 / 0.15 = 3600.

To account for the packing efficiency, we multiply this number by 0.8: 3600 * 0.8 = 2880.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can calculate the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3: 2880 * 0.3 = 864.

However, we are given that the true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900. To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we need to know what his guess was. Since we don't have this information, we can't calculate the exact difference."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. 

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first stop, 3/4 of 40 is (3/4) * 40 = 30. So, 30 people entered the bus at the second stop. The total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the remaining spaces, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost of visits for the first 5 years and the cost of visits for the next 3 years.

For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit is $2. Since Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, the annual cost is 3 * $2 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 5 * $6 = $30.

The cost of one visit increases by 150% after 5 years. A 150% increase means the new cost is 2.5 times the original cost. So, the new cost of one visit is $2 * 2.5 = $5. The annual cost for the next 3 years is 3 * $5 = $15. For 3 years, the total cost is 3 * $15 = $45.

The total cost for all 8 years is $30 + $45 = $75.

"To find out how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to determine the total number of groups required and then multiply that by the time it takes for each group to try the escape room.

There are 4 grades (4-7) with 10 students in each grade, so the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40.

Since only the top 10 students in each grade get to try the escape room, we need to find the total number of students who will try the escape room. Since there are 4 grades, we need to find the total number of students who will try the escape room in each grade, which is 10 students per grade. So, the total number of students who will try the escape room is 4 * 10 = 40.

However, only 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students who will try the escape room by the number of students per group: 40 / 8 = 5.

Since each group uses their full 45 minutes, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is the number of groups multiplied by the time per group: 5 * 45 = 225 minutes.

The final answer is: 225"
"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the tables and the total cost of the roof frames, then add them together.

The cost of the tables is 4 tables * $20 per table = $80.
The cost of the roof frames is 2 frames * $10 per frame = $20.

Now, we add the cost of the tables and the cost of the roof frames together: $80 + $20 = $100.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as 'x'. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length can be represented as 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet. We can write this as an equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Now, divide both sides by 5 to solve for x:

x = 40 / 5
x = 8

Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, we can find its length by multiplying x by 4:

Longer piece = 4x
Longer piece = 4 * 8
Longer piece = 32

The final answer is: 32"
"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound to find the total pounds of meat needed.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of ground beef

Since Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef, we can multiply the total pounds of meat by the amount of seasoning per pound to find the total amount of seasoning needed.

5 pounds of ground beef * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons of seasoning

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning to make 80 meatballs.

"Let's break down the information given. Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. If we let the number of cupcakes be 'c', then the number of brownies is 3c - 2.

Since each person gets 2 treats and there are 5 people in the class, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, so we can write the equation: c + (3c - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4c - 2 = 10.

Add 2 to both sides: 4c = 12.

Divide by 4: c = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount. 

The original cost of both manicure and pedicure is $35 + $40 = $75. 

The 20% discount on $75 is 0.20 * $75 = $15. 

So, the discounted cost of both manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers in total (5 on each hand), the cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted cost of manicure and pedicure plus the cost of nail art, which is $60 + $30 = $90.

"To find the price of the toy after the discount in January, we need to calculate the price after the increase in December and then apply the decrease in January.

The initial price of the toy in November is $40.

In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we multiply the initial price by 1.8 (100% + 80% = 180%, or 1 + 0.8 = 1.8).

New price in December = $40 * 1.8 = $72

In January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we multiply the price in December by 0.5 (100% - 50% = 50%, or 1 - 0.5 = 0.5).

New price in January = $72 * 0.5 = $36

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the income from the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons separately and then add them together.

For the standard rate lessons, Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 per hour. So, the total income from standard rate lessons is 4 * $80 = $320.

For the reduced rate lessons, Charlie has 2 lessons at a 25% discount. This means the reduced rate is 75% of the standard rate, which is 0.75 * $80 = $60 per hour. So, the total income from reduced rate lessons is 2 * $60 = $120.

Now, we add the income from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day: $320 + $120 = $440.

Let's start by finding the total number of novels she wrote last year. We know she wrote 9 novels last year.

Now, we multiply 9 by 4 to find the total number of novels she wrote this year.

9 * 4 = 36

So, Regina wrote 36 novels this year."
"To find the total distance covered by Michael in 3 days, we need to calculate the distance he covers in one day and then multiply it by 3.

First, let's convert the speed from km/hr to km/day. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply 50 km/hr by 24 hours to get the distance covered in a day:

50 km/hr * 24 hr/day = 1200 km/day

Now, we multiply the daily distance by 3 to get the total distance covered in 3 days:

1200 km/day * 3 days = 3600 km

Now, we need to find the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered. To do this, we divide the distance covered by Michael by the total distance between Alaska and Texas and multiply by 100:

(3600 km / 6000 km) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.
2. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass, so he used 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.
3. The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.
4. The remaining grapes are used by their mother to make pies. Since each pie requires 12 grapes, we need to find out how many pies she made. Let's call the number of pies 'x'. Then, the total number of grapes used for pies is 12x.
5. Since the total number of grapes used for pies is the remaining grapes after Madeline and her brother used their share, we can set up the equation: 12x = total grapes - (6 + 30) = total grapes - 36.
6. However, we don't know the total number of grapes at the beginning. Let's call it 'y'. Then, the equation becomes 12x = y - 36.
7. We know that the mother used the remaining grapes to make pies, so the number of pies she made is equal to the remaining grapes divided by 12. Since the remaining grapes are y - 36, we can set up the equation: x = (y - 36) / 12.
8. Now we have two equations: 12x = y - 36 and x = (y - 36) / 12. We can substitute the second equation into the first one: 12 * ((y - 36) / 12) = y - 36.
9. Simplifying the equation, we get y - 36 = y - 36.
10. This equation is true for any value of y, but we need to find a specific value. Let's go back to the fact that the mother used the remaining grapes to make pies. Since she used the remaining grapes, the number of pies she made is equal to the remaining grapes divided by 12. We know that the number of pies is a whole number, so the remaining grapes must be a multiple of 12.
11. Since Madeline and her brother used 36 grapes, the remaining grapes are y - 36. We can write an equation: y - 36 = 12k, where k is a whole number.
12. Solving for y, we get y = 12k + 36.
13. Since we don't know the value of k, we need more information. However, we can try to find the smallest possible value of y that satisfies the conditions. Let's try k = 1: y = 12 * 1 + 36 = 48.
14. If y = 48, then the mother used 48 - 36 = 12 grapes to make pies. Since each pie requires 12 grapes, she made 1 pie.
15. Now we can check if this value of y satisfies the conditions. Madeline ate 6 grapes, her brother used 30 grapes, and the mother used 12 grapes to make 1 pie. The total number of grapes used is 6 + 30 + 12 = 48, which is equal to the initial number of grapes.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total number of teachers at school that day, we need to add the number of teachers who were sick and the number of substitute teachers. 

First, let's find the number of teachers who were not sick. There were 82 teachers in total, and 13 were sick. So, the number of teachers who were not sick is 82 - 13 = 69.

However, this includes the 9 substitute teachers. To find the total number of teachers at school, we need to add the 9 substitute teachers to the 69 teachers who were not sick. 

So, the total number of teachers at school that day is 69 + 9 = 78.

"To find out how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate the total cost per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

The cost of pasta per week is $1.00.
The cost of cheddar cheese per week is $3.00.
The cost of gruyere cheese per week is $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.

The total cost per week is $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00.

There are 52 weeks in a year. 

The total cost per year is $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

"To find the total number of classrooms the custodian needs to clean, we already know that number is 80. 

The custodian has 5 days to complete the task. We need to find out how many minutes they have to work in total. Since they work 8 hours a day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 8 hours by 60 minutes per hour to get the total minutes per day: 8 * 60 = 480 minutes per day.

Since they have 5 days, we multiply the minutes per day by the number of days: 480 * 5 = 2400 minutes.

Now, we know it takes them 15 minutes per classroom. To find out how many classrooms they can clean in 2400 minutes, we divide the total minutes by the minutes per classroom: 2400 / 15 = 160 classrooms.

However, we know they have to clean 80 classrooms, not 160. This means they will not be able to finish the task in the given time. But to find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we need to know how many classrooms they can clean in a day. We divide the total minutes per day by the minutes per classroom: 480 / 15 = 32 classrooms per day.

Now, we can find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms. We divide the number of classrooms cleaned per day by the total number of classrooms, then multiply by 100: (32 / 80) * 100 = 40%.

The final answer is: 40"
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the capacity of each shelf. 

Let's denote the capacity of a middle shelf as 'm'. Since the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, its capacity is 2m. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so its capacity is 2m - 5.

We know that each of the middle shelves can hold 10 books. Therefore, m = 10.

Now, we can calculate the capacity of the bottom and top shelves:
- Bottom shelf: 2m = 2 * 10 = 20 books
- Top shelf: 2m - 5 = 2 * 10 - 5 = 15 books

The total capacity of the three shelves in one bookcase is 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to find out how many bookcases she needs to hold all of them. 

To do this, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase: 110 / 55 = 2.

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find Rose's profit, we first need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The cost of 5 dozens of eggs is 5 * $2.40 = $12.

Since 1 dozen has 12 eggs, 5 dozens will have 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

Rose will sell the eggs for $1 for 3 eggs, so the selling price for 60 eggs will be (60 / 3) * $1 = $20.

The profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost, which is $20 - $12 = $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To find the number of white hats, we first need to determine the number of red and blue hats. 

Half of the hats are red, so the number of red hats is 100 * 0.5 = 50.

The remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50. 

3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, so the number of blue hats is 50 * (3/5) = 30.

The number of white hats is the remaining hats after subtracting the red and blue hats, which is 50 - 30 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first calculate the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

Original price per bag: $18.00
Discount: $3.00
Discounted price per bag: $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can find the cost per stick by dividing the discounted price by the number of sticks.

Cost per stick: $15.00 / 30 sticks = $0.50 per stick

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100 (since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents).

Cost per stick in cents: $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to find out how many questions she needs to get right in total. 

The total number of questions in both tests is 70 + 40 = 110. To pass, she needs to get 70% of 110 questions correct. 

70% of 110 is 0.7 * 110 = 77. So, Audrey needs to get 77 questions correct in total.

She already got 60% of the first test correct, which is 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions. 

To find out how many questions she needs to get right on the second test, we subtract the number of questions she got right on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to get right: 77 - 42 = 35.

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B. We are given that B = 5S - 4. We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so S + B = 116.

We can substitute the expression for B into the second equation: S + (5S - 4) = 116. Combining like terms, we get 6S - 4 = 116. Adding 4 to both sides, we get 6S = 120. Dividing both sides by 6, we get S = 20.

Now that we know S, we can find B by substituting S into the equation B = 5S - 4: B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

"To find the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years, we need to calculate the total number of games she has played and then multiply it by her score per game.

Ara has been playing 40 games every year for 4 years. So, the total number of games she has played is:
40 games/year * 4 years = 160 games

Since her score for every game is 21 points, we can multiply the total number of games by her score per game to find the total points:
160 games * 21 points/game = 3360 points

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Brendan had 10 marbles.

He dropped half of them, so he lost 10 / 2 = 5 marbles.

He found 3 marbles, so he now has 5 (lost) + 3 (found) = 8 marbles.

However, one of the marbles he picked up was a bead, so he got rid of it. This means he lost 1 marble.

Now, he has 8 (marbles he had) - 1 (marble he got rid of) = 7 marbles.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the family, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Next, let's calculate the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of 8 rooms is 4. So, 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, which is 4 * 4 = 16 small candles. The other 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each, which is 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles. 

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Now, we add the number of flashlights and the number of candles together: 4 flashlights + 36 candles = 40.

"To find the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to calculate the time for each side and add them up.

The first side takes 5 minutes. 
The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each.
The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all sides:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

The total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total time it takes for Phineas to cover the distance on land and in water. 

First, we need to find the distance Phineas needs to cover on land and in water. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, Phineas needs to cover 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

Time taken to cover the distance on land = Distance / Speed
Time taken to cover the distance on land = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

Time taken to cover the distance in water = Distance / Speed
Time taken to cover the distance in water = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Total time taken = Time taken on land + Time taken in water
Total time taken = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

"To find the total cost of the phone plan, we need to determine the cost of the additional phones and add it to the cost of the main phone.

Let's assume the cost of each additional phone is x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We know that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

The total cost of the phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones:

Total cost = 20 + 40
Total cost = 60

"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in a day and then multiply it by the number of days in June.

Since Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day, and 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can calculate the total number of doughnuts he makes in a day as follows:

10 dozen * 12 doughnuts/dozen = 120 doughnuts/day

Since Derrick sells all the doughnuts, we can assume he sells 120 doughnuts every day.

Now, let's calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

To find the total number of doughnuts Derrick sells in June, we multiply the number of doughnuts he sells in a day by the number of days in June:

"To find the new speaking speed of John after training, we need to multiply his original speed by 2.5. 

Original speed = 150 WPM
New speed = 2.5 * 150 WPM = 375 WPM

Now, we need to find the total number of words John needs to speak. Since each page has 450 words, and he needs to speak 10 pages, the total number of words is:

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words/page = 4500 words

Now, we can find the time it takes for John to speak 4500 words at his new speed:

Time = Total words / New speed
Time = 4500 words / 375 WPM

To find the time in minutes, we need to divide the result by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 words per minute is equal to 1 word per second).

Time = (4500 words / 375 WPM) * (1 minute / 60) = 12 minutes

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the total number of people he saw on the first three days and add it to the total number of people he saw on the remaining days.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the number of people on the second day is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day, so the number of people on the third day is 2 * 70 = 140.

The total number of people on the first three days is 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, the total number of people he saw on the remaining days is 60 * 4 = 240.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 260 + 240 = 500.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop. 

In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.

In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to four times the initial rate, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, which is 0.5 * 80 = 40 kernels.

So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 120 seconds is 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels.

After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. This is 0.25 * 40 = 10 kernels.

The total number of kernels that popped is 200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

"To find out how many lemons Tim will need, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemonade he needs to make, including the extra gallon for Allen. Since he needs to make 4 gallons of regular lemonade and 1 extra gallon that is twice as tart, we can consider the extra gallon as 2 gallons of regular lemonade. 

So, in total, Tim needs to make 4 + 2 = 6 gallons of lemonade.

Since each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the total amount of lemon juice needed. 

6 gallons * 1 cup/gallon = 6 cups of lemon juice

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the total number of lemons needed for 6 cups of juice.

6 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 36 lemons

Therefore, Tim will need 36 lemons.

"To find the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we need to calculate the daily consumption of both breeds and then multiply it by 7.

The German Shepherds consume 5 kilograms each per day, and there are 3 of them. So, their daily consumption is 5 * 3 = 15 kilograms.

The Bulldogs consume 3 kilograms each per day, and there are 2 of them. So, their daily consumption is 3 * 2 = 6 kilograms.

The total daily consumption is the sum of the consumption of both breeds: 15 + 6 = 21 kilograms.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 21 * 7 = 147 kilograms.

Therefore, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by Elvis in both directions and then find the remaining distance from his house.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the west direction. Distance = Speed * Time. Since Elvis was driving at 18mph for 5 hours, the distance traveled in the west direction is:

Distance = 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles

Now, Elvis turns around and travels east for 8 hours at the same speed of 18mph. The distance traveled in the east direction is:

Distance = 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles in the west direction and 144 miles in the east direction, the net distance from his house is the difference between the two distances:

Net distance = Distance traveled east - Distance traveled west
Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles
Net distance = 54 miles

"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and subtract it from the initial value.

Initial value of the boat = $9000

First year depreciation: 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Second year depreciation: 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Third year depreciation: 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after third year = $4410 - $882 = $3528

"To find the number of pink candies, we first need to determine the number of orange and yellow candies. 

We are given that there are 54 red candies. Since there are twice as many orange candies as red candies, the number of orange candies is 2 * 54 = 108.

We are also given that there are half as many yellow candies as red candies. The number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, we know the total number of candies is 232. We can find the total number of non-pink candies by adding the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of non-pink candies from the total number of candies: 232 - 189 = 43.

The final answer is: 43"
"To find the total cost of the hotel and bus travels, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel and the cost of the bus trips separately and then add them together.

The cost of the hotel for 3 nights is 3 * $80 = $240.

The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel, which is 0.1 * $80 = $8.

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus trips is 7 * $8 = $56.

The total cost of the hotel and bus travels is $240 + $56 = $296.

The final answer is: $296"
"To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we first need to determine how many marbles Dallas received. We know that Dallas has 21 marbles after dropping 4, so he must have had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles initially.

Since Mazie gave a total of 52 marbles to the twins, and Dallas received 25, we can find out how many marbles Darla received by subtracting 25 from 52.

52 (total marbles given) - 25 (marbles given to Dallas) = 27

So, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla.

"To find the total weight of the car and its contents, we need to add the weight of the car, the luggage, and the weight of the two children.

Total weight = weight of car + weight of luggage + weight of children
Total weight = 1200 pounds + 250 pounds + (2 * 75 pounds)
Total weight = 1200 pounds + 250 pounds + 150 pounds
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Since the force needed to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we need to calculate 1% of 1600 pounds.

Force needed = 1% * 1600 pounds
Force needed = 0.01 * 1600 pounds
Force needed = 16 pounds

"To determine the amount of crepe paper James needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of the backyard fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2l + 2w, where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the length (l) is 20 feet and the width (w) is 15 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(20) + 2(15)
P = 40 + 30
P = 70

So, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to go around the entire fence.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the average age of Mia and Emma, we first need to determine Emma's age. Since Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart in age, we can calculate Emma's age by adding 16 to Mia's age.

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now that we know both Mia's and Emma's ages, we can find the average of their ages by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

Next, we subtract the number of cracked seashells: 
732 - 67 = 665

So, the total number of good seashells they found together is 665."
"To find the total cost of the place settings, we need to calculate the cost of each type of plate and then add them together.

Avery needs 12 dinner plates, and each costs $6.00, so the total cost of dinner plates is 12 x $6.00 = $72.00.

She also needs 12 bowls, and each costs $5.00, so the total cost of bowls is 12 x $5.00 = $60.00.

For the salad plates, she needs 12 as well, and each costs $4.00, so the total cost of salad plates is 12 x $4.00 = $48.00.

Now, we add the costs of all three types of plates together: $72.00 + $60.00 + $48.00 = $180.00.

The total amount Avery will spend on place settings is $180.00."
"To find out how long it took Anna to finish the puzzle, we first need to determine half of Steve's time. Steve took 10 hours to complete the puzzle. Half of 10 hours is 10 / 2 = 5 hours.

"To find out how much feed is left after a week, we first need to calculate how much feed the pigs eat in a day and then multiply it by 7 to get the weekly consumption.

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so the total feed consumption per pig per day is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

Since Dexter has 5 pigs, the total feed consumption per day for all pigs is 8 * 5 = 40 pounds.

Now, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 to get the weekly consumption: 40 * 7 = 280 pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so to find out how much is left, we subtract the weekly consumption from the total ordered: 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

"To find out how many hot dogs John needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the party. 

Since each guest will eat 2 hot dogs and there are 20 guests, the total number of hot dogs needed is 20 * 2 = 40 hot dogs.

However, John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. So, the total number of hot dogs he needs to buy is 40 - 4 = 36 hot dogs.

Since a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2, we need to find out how many packs John needs to buy. 

To do this, we divide the total number of hot dogs needed by the number of hot dogs in a pack: 36 / 6 = 6.

Since each pack costs $2, the total amount John needs to spend on hot dogs is 6 * $2 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how much money Frances has left, we need to calculate her total earnings and subtract her total expenses.

First, let's calculate her total earnings from selling cupcakes and cookies:

Earnings from cupcakes: 20 cupcakes * $2/cupcake = $40
Earnings from cookies: 40 cookies * $1/cookie = $40
Total earnings: $40 + $40 = $80

Now, let's calculate her total expenses for buying the trays:

She buys 5 trays at $4 each, so her total expenses are: 5 trays * $4/tray = $20

Now, let's subtract her total expenses from her total earnings to find out how much money she has left:

Total earnings: $80
Total expenses: $20
Money left: $80 - $20 = $60

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 5 children following the truck.

On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child, so the total number of children becomes 5 + 5 = 10.

On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children, so the total number of children becomes 10 + (10 * 2) = 10 + 20 = 30.

The original 5 children then give up and leave the group, so we subtract 5 from the total number of children: 30 - 5 = 25.

Therefore, there are 25 children now following the truck.

The final answer is: 25"

Now, we know that all 3 sisters are 16 years old. 

The total age of the 3 sisters is 16 * 3 = 48 years.

The total age of the 2 brothers is 12 + 24 = 36 years.

To find the total age of all siblings, we add the total age of the brothers and the total age of the sisters: 48 + 36 = 84 years.

"To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity separately and then add them together.

Meditation time per day: 15 minutes (morning) + 15 minutes (night) = 30 minutes
Since Charisma practices meditation every day, we multiply the daily meditation time by 7 (days in a week) and then by 4 (weeks):
30 minutes/day * 7 days/week = 210 minutes/week
210 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 840 minutes

Yoga time per week: 1 hour (60 minutes) * 5 days/week = 300 minutes/week
Since this is a weekly activity, we multiply the weekly yoga time by 4 weeks:
300 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1200 minutes

Total time spent on meditation and yoga: 840 minutes (meditation) + 1200 minutes (yoga) = 2040 minutes

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen equals 12, a small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5, which equals 18. 

Now, we add the 50% more seeds to the original 36 seeds: 36 + 18 = 54 seeds in a large sunflower.

To find the total number of seeds, we add the seeds from the small sunflower and the large sunflower: 36 + 54 = 90 seeds.

The total number of sunflower seeds is 90."

Timothy's pens = 3 * George's pens
Timothy's pens = 3 * 18
Timothy's pens = 54

Next, we need to find out how many pens Sarah has. Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we can calculate Sarah's pens as follows:

"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, the total cost of the T-shirts would be 2 * $8 = $16. However, since there's a buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake only pays for one T-shirt at the original price and the other one at 50% off. So, the cost of the first T-shirt is $8 and the cost of the second T-shirt is $8 * 0.5 = $4. The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and Jake gets a 40% discount. The discount amount is $40 * 0.4 = $16. So, the cost of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store. The total cost is $12 + $24 = $36.

"Let's break down the information given. We know that Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, but Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron. This means that if Aaron runs a certain distance in a certain time, Vanessa will run twice that distance in the same time.

Let's denote the time it takes Aaron to run 1 mile as 't'. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, the time it takes Vanessa to run 1 mile is 2t.

We are given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, and since he runs twice as fast as Vanessa, the distance he ran is half of the distance Vanessa ran. Vanessa ran 4 miles, so Aaron ran 4/2 = 2 miles.

Since Aaron runs 2 miles in 16 minutes, the time it takes him to run 1 mile is 16/2 = 8 minutes. This means that t = 8 minutes.

Now, we know that Vanessa runs 2t miles in the same time it takes Aaron to run 1 mile. Since t = 8 minutes, Vanessa runs 2t = 2 * 8 = 16 minutes to run 2 miles. 

However, Vanessa ran 4 miles, so the time it takes her to run 4 miles is 2 times the time it takes her to run 2 miles. Therefore, the time it takes Vanessa to complete her part of the race is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes.

"To find the cost price of each watermelon, we first need to find the total cost of the watermelons. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price per watermelon is $80 / 50 = $1.60.

Since the vendor sold the watermelons at a profit of 25%, the selling price per watermelon is 125% of the cost price (100% of the cost price + 25% profit). 

To find the selling price, we multiply the cost price by 1.25 (which is 125% expressed as a decimal). So, the selling price per watermelon is $1.60 * 1.25 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then determine the age of John's youngest son.

First, let's find James' current age. We know that James is twice as old as Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. This means that James is twice as old as 12 - 3 = 9 years old. So, James is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.

Since James is 18 years old and John had him when he was 19, John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

Now, we need to find the age of John's youngest son. We know that John's youngest son was born when John was 32. Since John is currently 37, his youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many oranges each person can peel in an hour and then compare their rates.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

To find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane, we subtract Jane's total from Ana's total: 20 - 15 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original price of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it for 80% off. 

80% off means he pays 20% of the original price. To find 20% of $400, we multiply $400 by 0.20. 

$400 * 0.20 = $80

So, Mark pays $80 for the radiator. 

Next, we need to calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic works for 3 hours at $50 an hour. 

Cost of mechanic = 3 hours * $50/hour = $150

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic to find the total cost.

Total cost = $80 (radiator) + $150 (mechanic) = $230

The final answer is: $230"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation:

C + W = 20

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, so we can write the equation:

2C + 4W = 70

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by 2 to get:

2C + 2W = 40

Now we can subtract this equation from the second equation to get:

2C + 4W - (2C + 2W) = 70 - 40
2W = 30

Dividing both sides by 2 gives:

W = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of chickens:

C + 15 = 20
C = 5

So, there are 5 chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, let's find the total number of slices. There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. 

Total slices = 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

There are 4 people in total, including Henry and his 3 friends. 

Slices per person = Total slices / Number of people = 56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices/person

So, each person can have 14 slices. 

The final answer is: 14"
