"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first determine how many eggs she has left after eating and baking. 

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and bakes 4 for muffins, so she uses a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. 

Now, let's subtract the number of eggs she uses from the total number of eggs she lays: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

Janet sells these 9 eggs at $2 each, so she makes 9 * 2 = $18 per day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts needed for the robe, we first need to determine the amount of white fiber required. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, we calculate the white fiber as 2 / 2 = 1 bolt.

Now, we add the blue fiber and white fiber together: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit Josh made, we first need to determine the total value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

Let's denote the increased value as x. We can set up the equation: 80,000 + 50,000 = x + 1.5x (since 150% increase is the same as multiplying by 2.5 or 1.5).

Combine like terms: 130,000 = 2.5x

Now, divide both sides by 2.5 to solve for x: x = 130,000 / 2.5 = 52,000

So, the total value of the house after the repairs is $52,000. 

To find the profit, we subtract the original cost of the house from the new value: 52,000 - 80,000 = -$28,000. However, this is the loss, not the profit. 

Since Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, we need to add this to the original cost of the house to find the total investment: 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000.

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the original cost of the house from the new value: 52,000 - 80,000 = -$28,000. However, this is the loss, not the profit. 

The correct way to find the profit is to subtract the original cost of the house from the total value after repairs, but since the value after repairs is less than the original cost plus the repairs, we need to find the profit from the original cost of the house and the repairs. 

The profit is the value of the repairs minus the cost of the repairs: 52,000 - 50,000 = 2,000.

The final answer is: $2,000."
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he has in a week.

Since James runs 3 sprints in one session, and each sprint is 60 meters, the total meters he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James runs 3 sessions a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to determine the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals. 

In the morning, she gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed. So, the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of feed per day, and she has a flock of 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed per day is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

Now, to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals from the total amount of feed needed per day. 

60 (total feed needed per day) - 40 (feed given in morning and afternoon) = 20 cups.

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 
The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * $3 = $1.8. 
We can see that the cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of the previous glass. 

The sequence of the cost of the glasses is: $5, $3, $1.8, $1.08, $0.64, $0.384, $0.2304, $0.13824, $0.082944, $0.0497664, $0.02986584, $0.017949504, $0.0107949032, $0.00646784192, $0.003863960576, $0.0023281813456, $0.0014005088.

To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of all the glasses. 
Total cost = $5 + $3 + $1.8 + $1.08 + $0.64 + $0.384 + $0.2304 + $0.13824 + $0.082944 + $0.0497664 + $0.02986584 + $0.017949504 + $0.0107949032 + $0.00646784192 + $0.003863960576 + $0.0023281813456 + $0.0014005088.

Total cost ≈ $24.999999999999996.

However, we can also use a formula to find the total cost. The cost of the first glass is $5, and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses is the sum of a geometric series with a first term of $3 and a common ratio of 0.6. 

The sum of a geometric series is given by the formula: S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = $3, r = 0.6, and n = 15. 

S = $3 * (1 - 0.6^15) / (1 - 0.6)

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   Since Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

2. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   Since Charleston has 80 sheep, Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, let's add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together:
160 (Toulouse) + 80 (Charleston) + 20 (Seattle) = 260

The final answer is: 260"
"To find the total time it takes Carla to download the file, we need to calculate the time taken for the first part of the download, the time taken for the restart, and the time taken for the second part of the download.

First, let's find the time taken for the first part of the download. Carla can download 2 GB/minute. The file is 200 GB, so the time taken for the first part of the download is:

Time = Total size / Download speed
Time = 200 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time = 100 minutes

Since Carla is 40% of the way through the download, she has downloaded 40% of the file. To find the size of the file downloaded, we multiply the total size by 0.4:

Size downloaded = 200 GB * 0.4
Size downloaded = 80 GB

Now, we need to find the time taken to download 80 GB at a speed of 2 GB/minute:

Time = Size downloaded / Download speed
Time = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time = 40 minutes

The time taken for the first part of the download is 100 minutes, and the time taken to download 80 GB is 40 minutes. However, we need to add the time taken for the restart, which is 20 minutes.

Total time for the first part of the download = 100 minutes + 20 minutes = 120 minutes

Now, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. The remaining size of the file is 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB. The time taken to download the remaining 120 GB is:

Time = Size remaining / Download speed
Time = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time = 60 minutes

The total time taken to download the file is the sum of the time taken for the first part of the download, the time taken for the restart, and the time taken for the second part of the download:

Total time = 120 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes
Total time = 200 minutes

The final answer is: 200"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the distance covered in each segment.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. The distance covered in this segment is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

Since he turns around, he is now 180 miles away from home.

Next, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance in this segment.

Then, he drives for half an hour (0.5 hours) at 30 mph. The distance covered in this segment is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

Now, he is 180 - 15 = 165 miles away from home.

Finally, he drives for the remaining 2.5 hours (4 - 1.5 hours) at 80 mph. The distance covered in this segment is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 2.5 = 200 miles

Now, he is 165 - 200 = -35 miles away from home. However, since distance cannot be negative, this means he is actually 35 miles away from home.

The final answer is: 35"
"To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is $10 * 1.2 = $12/hour. So, her earnings for the overtime hours are:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total earnings for the week = $400 + $60 = $460

$460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and then add them up.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it's 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. Then, we subtract 54 from 180 to get 126 downloads in the third month.

Now, let's add up the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts: 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen will be 3 x $68 = $204.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes: 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen will be 2 x $80 = $160.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen will be 6 x $55 = $330.

Finally, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of planting the tree and the annual expenses, and then find the point at which the total earnings from selling lemons exceed these costs.

The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. The annual expenses for watering and feeding the tree are $3. 

Each year, the tree will grow 7 lemons, which can be sold for $1.5 each, resulting in a total annual revenue of 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.

To find the break-even point, we need to calculate the total cost of the tree and the total annual expenses, and then find the point at which the total earnings from selling lemons exceed these costs.

Let's denote the number of years it takes to break even as 'x'. The total cost of the tree is $90, and the total annual expenses are $3. The total earnings from selling lemons in 'x' years will be $10.5x.

The equation to find the break-even point is:

Total cost = Total earnings - Total expenses
$90 = $10.5x - $3x

Combine like terms:
$90 = $7.5x

Now, divide both sides by $7.5:
x = $90 / $7.5
x = 12

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

At the green house, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners, which is x/3.

She had x - x/3 = 2x/3 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the green house.

Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she had 2x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which is (2x/3 - 2)/2 = x/3 - 1 vacuum cleaners.

Now, we know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:

x - (x/3 - 2) - (x/3 - 1) = 5

Combine like terms:

x - x/3 + 2 - x/3 + 1 = 5

Combine the x terms:

x - 2x/3 + 3 = 5

Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:

3x - 2x + 9 = 15

Combine like terms:

x + 9 = 15

Subtract 9 from both sides:

x = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, and then subtract that from the total number of students.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20 * 0.2 = 4 students

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
16 * 0.25 = 4 students

The number of students who enrolled in jazz dance is 4, and the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance is 4. So, the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students.

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the maximum profit, we need to calculate the potential value of each purchase after the market fluctuation. 

For the jewelry, the value will increase by 2.5% of $5,000, which is 0.025 * $5,000 = $125. So, the new value of the jewelry will be $5,000 + $125 = $5,125.

For the electronic gadgets, the value will increase by 1.2% of $8,000, which is 0.012 * $8,000 = $96. So, the new value of the electronic gadgets will be $8,000 + $96 = $8,096.

Since the merchant is looking to maximize profit, we need to choose the option with the higher value after the market fluctuation. In this case, the electronic gadgets will be worth $8,096, which is higher than the jewelry's value of $5,125.

To calculate the profit, we need to know the initial cost of the electronic gadgets, which is $8,000. The profit will be the difference between the new value and the initial cost, which is $8,096 - $8,000 = $96.

The final answer is: $96"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered on the first day and the distance covered on the second day.

On the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance. So, each train covers 80 miles on the first day.

On the second day, they travel northward, covering 150 miles. Again, since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance. So, each train covers 150 miles on the second day.

To find the total distance covered by each train in the two days, we add the distances covered on the first and second days:

Total distance covered by each train = 80 miles (first day) + 150 miles (second day) = 230 miles

The final answer is: 230"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:

She works 35 hours a week as a teacher and gets paid $20 per hour. So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
35 hours/week * $20/hour = $700/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are:
$700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:

She works 15 hours a week as a coach and gets paid $30 per hour. So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
15 hours/week * $30/hour = $450/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are:
$450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
$35,000/year (teaching) + $22,500/year (coaching) = $57,500/year

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To find out how many eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week and then multiply it by 4.

Since Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. 

There are 7 days in a week, so she eats 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week.

In 4 weeks, she will eat 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she will eat in 4 weeks.

84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much time Marissa has left to walk the remaining distance. 

She has walked 4 miles in 1 hour and 2 miles in another hour, so she has walked a total of 6 miles in 2 hours. 

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles, and she has already walked 6 miles, so she has 12 - 6 = 6 miles left to walk.

Since she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, and the total distance is 12 miles, she needs to cover the total distance in 12 / 4 = 3 hours.

She has already walked for 2 hours, so she has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left to walk the remaining 6 miles.

To find her required speed, we divide the remaining distance by the remaining time: 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total amount of water in the orange drink, we first need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters. 

Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the remaining one-third is the non-water portion. So, the non-water portion is 10 - 6.67 = 3.33 liters.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water in the pineapple drink. Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

When we add the orange and pineapple drinks together, we get a total of 10 + 15 = 25 liters. However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so the actual total is 25 - 1 = 24 liters.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is the sum of the water in the orange and pineapple drinks. This is 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters.

The final answer is: 15.67"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how old Raymond was when his son was born. 

Since Samantha is now 31 and Raymond was born 6 years before her, Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old now.

Raymond had a son at the age of 23, so when his son was born, Raymond was 23 years old. 

Now, we need to find out how many years ago this happened. Since Raymond is 25 now and he was 23 when his son was born, we subtract 23 from 25 to get the number of years that have passed since his son was born.

25 - 23 = 2

So, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total number of DVDs sold by Billy, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers separately and then add them together.

The first 3 customers buy one DVD each, so the total number of DVDs sold to them is 3 * 1 = 3.

The next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each, so the total number of DVDs sold to them is 2 * 2 = 4.

Now, we add the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers: 3 + 4 = 7.

The last 3 customers don't buy any DVDs, so we don't need to add anything for them.

Therefore, the total number of DVDs sold by Billy on Tuesday is 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total number of centimeters the candle will be shorter, we need to calculate the total time it burns and multiply it by the rate at which it melts.

The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is a total of 4 hours.

The rate at which the candle melts is 2 centimeters per hour.

So, the total number of centimeters the candle will be shorter is 4 hours * 2 centimeters/hour = 8 centimeters.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the original price of the book, we need to determine the amount of the discount and add it to the discounted price. 

First, let's find the amount of the discount: 
Discount = 25% of the original price
Let the original price be x
Discount = 0.25x

Since the discounted price is $19.50, we can set up the equation:
x - 0.25x = 19.50
0.75x = 19.50

Now, we can solve for x:
x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she ordered excluding the pizza. 

The cost of the chicken meal is $12. 
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15. 
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6. 

The total cost of the items excluding pizza is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33. 

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17. 

Now, we need to find out how many boxes of pizza cost $17. Each box costs $8.50, so the number of boxes is $17 / $8.50 = 2.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total amount Mishka spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

The cost of 3 pairs of shorts is 3 x $16.50 = $49.50.
The cost of 3 pairs of pants is 3 x $22.50 = $67.50.
The cost of 3 pairs of shoes is 3 x $42 = $126.

Now, let's add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

The final answer is: $243"
"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she buys and then multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will need 60 cartons of ice cream for 60 days (1 serving per night for 60 nights).

Each carton has 15 servings, so to find out how many cartons she needs, we divide the total number of nights by the number of servings per carton:

60 nights / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Now, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton to find the total cost:

4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

So, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

First, let's find the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip. Since Henry's second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip is 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

Now, we know that Henry traveled 20 miles before his first stop. So, the distance between his first and second stops is the difference between the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance traveled before the first stop. 

Distance between the first and second stops = Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip - Distance traveled before the first stop
= 45 miles - 20 miles
= 25 miles

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, which means the second pair costs 2 * 33 = $66. 

The total cost of the two pairs of heels is 33 + 66 = $99. We are also told that the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. 

Let's represent the cost of the boots as 'x'. Since the two pairs of heels cost five dollars less than the boots, we can write the equation: x - 5 = 99.

To find the cost of the boots, we need to solve for 'x'. We can do this by adding 5 to both sides of the equation: x = 99 + 5.

x = 104

The final answer is: 104"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Darrell's age be 7x and Allen's age be 11x, where x is a constant.

Since their total age is 162, we can write the equation:
7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms:
18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18:
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Darrell's and Allen's current ages:
Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, add 10 to his current age:
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the total number of guesses and divide it by the number of friends.

The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first one, which is (80 / 2) + 20 = 60.
The third friend guesses 25% more than the first one, which is 80 + (80 * 0.25) = 100.

Now, let's add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

There are 3 friends, so we divide the total by 3 to find the average: 240 / 3 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total hours John spends taking care of dogs in a week, we need to first calculate the total hours he spends per day. 

Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day, and John takes care of 10 dogs. So, the total hours per day is 0.5 * 10 = 5 hours.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the total hours per day by 7 to get the total hours per week. 

5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

The final answer is: 35"
"To find the number of gold coins, we need to first establish the relationship between the number of gold and silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'.

We know that the total number of coins is 110. The sum of gold and silver coins is equal to the total number of coins. Therefore, we can write the equation as:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:
2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since x represents the number of silver coins, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we first need to determine how many jewels Aaron has. 

Since Raymond has 40 jewels, half of Raymond's jewels would be 40 / 2 = 20. 

Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total points scored by Mike, we first need to calculate the points scored in the second 20 minutes. 

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points. 
In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. 
25% of 4 points is 0.25 * 4 = 1 point. 
So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 + 1 = 5 points. 
Now, we add the points scored in both periods: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to first calculate how many yogurts he eats in 30 days and then find out the cost of those yogurts.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Since they are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry buys in 30 days. To do this, we divide the total number of yogurts he eats by 4: 60 / 4 = 15 sets.

Now, we multiply the number of sets by the cost per set: 15 sets * $5.00 = $75.00.

So, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To find out how many Lego sets John sold, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets. 

He sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is 13 * 15 = $195.

Next, we need to find out how much money he spent on video games. He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so the total amount of money he spent on video games is 8 * 20 = $160.

Since he had $5 left after buying the video games, we can find out how much money he had before buying the video games by adding the money he had left to the money he spent on video games. So, he had $160 + $5 = $165 before buying the video games.

Now, we can find out how much money he made from selling the Lego sets by subtracting the money he had before buying the video games from the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets. However, we can also find out how much money he made from selling the Lego sets by subtracting the money he spent on video games from the money he had after buying the video games. Since both methods should give the same result, we can use either one. 

Let's use the second method: $165 + $5 = $170. This is the total amount of money he had after buying the video games. We know he spent $160 on video games, so the amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets is $170 - $160 = $10.

Now, we can find out how many Lego sets he sold by dividing the amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets by the price of each Lego set. So, he sold 10 / 15 = 2/3 of his Lego sets.

Since he started with 13 Lego sets, we can find out how many Lego sets he still has by subtracting the number of Lego sets he sold from the total number of Lego sets he had. However, we know he sold 2/3 of his Lego sets, so we can also find out how many Lego sets he still has by subtracting 2/3 of 13 from 13.

To subtract 2/3 of 13 from 13, we can multiply 13 by 2/3 and then subtract the result from 13. 13 * 2/3 = 26/3 = 8.67. Now, we can subtract 8.67 from 13 to find out how many Lego sets he still has. 13 - 8.67 = 4.33. However, we can't have a fraction of a Lego set, so we round down to the nearest whole number. 

The final answer is: 4"
"To find John's running speed, we first need to calculate the total hours he runs per week. 

He runs 3 hours on the first day. The other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours per day. 

So, the total hours he runs per week is 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours.

Now, we know John runs 60 miles a week and 6 hours a week. To find his speed, we divide the total miles by the total hours: 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running and walking speeds. 

Given that Dana can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, and she can skip at 3 miles per hour, we can find her running speed by multiplying her skipping speed by 2. 

Dana's running speed = 2 * 3 miles per hour = 6 miles per hour.

Since Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, we can find her walking speed by dividing her running speed by 4.

Dana's walking speed = 6 miles per hour / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, we know that Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, in 6 hours, she spends 2 hours running and 4 hours walking.

Distance traveled while running = speed * time = 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.

Distance traveled while walking = speed * time = 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours = 6 miles.

Total distance traveled = distance traveled while running + distance traveled while walking = 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

The final answer is: 18"

"To solve this problem, we need to find the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone. Since she can throw it three times farther than when not holding the gemstone, we multiply the original distance by 3.

Original distance = 400 feet
Distance with gemstone = 3 * 400 = 1200 feet

Now, we need to find the distance outside the dragon's reach where Polly can still hit the dragon. The dragon's reach is 1000 feet, so Polly needs to be at least 1000 feet away from the dragon to be outside its reach.

Distance outside reach = Distance with gemstone - Dragon's reach
= 1200 - 1000
= 200 feet

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit it with the gold javelin.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to first find out the total number of pieces of pie that were available initially. Since Grandma Jones baked 5 pies and cut each pie into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is 5 * 8 = 40.

Now, we know that at the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces: 40 - 14 = 26.

So, the guests took 26 pieces of pie.

"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to calculate how many calories you have left for the day. 

Your daily calorie target is 2000, and you have already consumed 1800 calories. 

2000 (daily target) - 1800 (already consumed) = 200 calories left for the day.

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, we need to find out how many servings you can have with the remaining calories.

200 (calories left) / 250 (calories per serving) = 0.8 servings

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, we need to find out how many grams are in one serving.

300g (total weight) / 5 (servings) = 60g per serving

Now, we multiply the number of servings you can have by the weight of one serving.

0.8 (servings) * 60g (per serving) = 48g

"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

First, let's find the total cost. Since one pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00, and Charlie makes 10 candles per pound, the cost per candle is $1.00. 

Now, let's find the total cost for 20 candles: 
Total cost = cost per candle * number of candles
Total cost = $1.00 * 20
Total cost = $20.00

Next, let's find the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, so the total revenue for 20 candles is:
Total revenue = price per candle * number of candles
Total revenue = $2.00 * 20
Total revenue = $40.00

Now, let's find the net profit:
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we first need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. To find this, we multiply the number of articles she wrote on Monday by 2/5 and add it to the original number of articles.

2/5 * 5 = 2
5 + 2 = 7

So, on Tuesday, Meredith wrote 7 articles.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. To find this, we multiply the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday by 2.

7 * 2 = 14

Now, we have the number of articles she wrote each day: 5 on Monday, 7 on Tuesday, and 14 on Wednesday.

The total number of articles she wrote is 5 + 7 + 14 = 26.

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to write, we multiply the total number of articles by the time it takes to write one article.

26 * 4 = 104

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to first determine how many Post-it notes she used in total. 

Candice started with 80 Post-it notes. She used 220 Post-it notes at work. To find out how many she had left, we subtract the number of Post-it notes she used from the number she started with: 80 - 220 = -140. However, this is not possible since you can't have a negative number of Post-it notes. This means she must have used more Post-it notes than she had initially. 

Since she had 23 Post-it notes remaining, we can set up an equation to find out how many Post-it notes she used in total: 80 (initial Post-it notes) + x (Post-it notes in the package) - 23 (remaining Post-it notes) = 220 (Post-it notes used). 

Now, let's solve for x: 80 + x - 23 = 220. Simplifying the equation, we get x - 23 = 140. Adding 23 to both sides, we get x = 163.

So, Candice purchased 163 Post-it notes in the package.

163"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. To find the number of blue ties, we can divide the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost per tie:

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

Now, we know that the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. This means the cost of a red tie is 1.5 times the cost of a blue tie:

Cost of a red tie = 1.5 * Cost of a blue tie
= 1.5 * $40
= $60

To find the total amount spent on red ties, we multiply the number of red ties by the cost per red tie:

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

The total amount spent on ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches, since the pieces are 6 inches long. 

1 foot is equal to 12 inches. 

So, 4 feet is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we can divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches) to find the number of pieces:

48 ÷ 6 = 8

Tracy obtained 8 pieces."
"To find the total number of units in the building, we need to multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor. 

Number of floors: 15
Units per floor: 8

Total units = Number of floors * Units per floor
Total units = 15 * 8
Total units = 120

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total units to determine the number of unoccupied units.

Unoccupied units = Total units * (1 - 3/4)
Unoccupied units = Total units * 1/4
Unoccupied units = 120 * 1/4
Unoccupied units = 30

"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we first need to calculate how many eggs he produces in a week and then multiply that by the price per dozen.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of eggs produced per day by 7:

252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Since Lloyd sells eggs by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens:

1764 eggs/week / 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen eggs/week

Now, we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen:

147 dozen eggs/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

So, Lloyd makes $294 per week on eggs.

"To find the total time Tom's ship takes to travel from 1 to 4 PM and back, we need to calculate the time taken for each leg of the journey separately.

First, let's find the time taken to travel from 1 to 4 PM. Since the speed is not given for this part of the journey, we can assume it's the same as the return journey, which is 6 mph. However, the problem states that he travels at 10 miles per hour for this part. 

Distance = Speed * Time. We can rearrange this formula to find Time = Distance / Speed. 

Distance from 1 to 4 PM is 3 miles (assuming it's a straight line, which is not the case in real-world navigation, but we'll go with it for simplicity). 

Time taken to travel from 1 to 4 PM = 3 miles / 10 mph = 0.3 hours.

Now, let's find the time taken to travel back from 4 to 1 PM. The distance is the same, 3 miles, and the speed is 6 mph.

Time taken to travel back from 4 to 1 PM = 3 miles / 6 mph = 0.5 hours.

The total time taken for the round trip is the sum of the time taken for each leg of the journey.

Total time = 0.3 hours + 0.5 hours = 0.8 hours.

To convert hours to hours and minutes, we multiply the decimal part by 60. 

0.8 hours = 0.8 * 60 = 48 minutes.

However, the question asks for the time taken to get back, which is 0.5 hours or 30 minutes.

The final answer is: 0.5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much weight the comic books are removing from the bag. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and Uriah removes 30 comic books, the total weight removed by the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, we know that Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from the bag. Since the comic books are removing 7.5 pounds, the remaining weight that needs to be removed by the toys is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so to find out how many toys need to be removed, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

"To find the total revenue for each day, we need to calculate the revenue from truck tires and car tires separately and then add them together.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360. The revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160. The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires. The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480. Since there are no truck tires, the total revenue on Friday is $480.

To find the day with higher revenue, we compare the revenues: $520 (Thursday) and $480 (Friday). Thursday has higher revenue.

Now, to find how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we subtract the lower revenue from the higher revenue: $520 - $480 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of kittens, we first need to determine the number of kittens each cat had. 

Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens, and since there were 7 adopted kittens, Patchy had 3 * 7 = 21 kittens.

Trixie had 12 kittens.

Now, we add the number of adopted kittens to the number of kittens from the two house cats: 7 (adopted) + 21 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 40.

The Doubtfire family now has 40 kittens."
"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we first need to determine the number of lollipops left after eating 2. 

Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2, so the remaining lollipops are 30 - 2 = 28.

Since Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to find out how many bags can be filled.

28 lollipops / 2 lollipops per bag = 14 bags

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate how many times he can afford the total cost of a movie outing, which includes both the ticket and popcorn.

The total cost of a movie outing is $7 (ticket) + $7 (popcorn) = $14.

We know Peter has $42 for the week. To find out how many times he can go to the movies, we'll divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of a movie outing.

$42 ÷ $14 = 3

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week.

"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to first calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after the truck and driver are on it. 

The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. The weight limit of the bridge is 5000 pounds. 

Remaining weight capacity = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds.

Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we can divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of each box to find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded.

Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15 = 83.

The final answer is: 83"
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we first need to calculate the total cost after the delivery vendor's fee. 

The original bill was $40.00. The vendor added a 25% fee to this amount. To find 25% of $40.00, we multiply $40.00 by 0.25. 

$40.00 * 0.25 = $10.00

Now, we add the 25% fee to the original bill: 
$40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00

Next, we add the $3.00 delivery fee to the total: 
$50.00 + $3.00 = $53.00

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip to the total: 
$53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00.

The final answer is: $57.00"

There is 1 bad orange, 20% of 25 oranges are unripe, and 2 are sour. 

First, let's find the number of unripe oranges: 
20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges

Now, let's add the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges: 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges

Now, let's subtract the number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges: 
25 (total) - 8 (not good) = 17 oranges

The number of good oranges is 17."
"To find the total amount Janet paid, we need to add the cost of the material and the cost of the jeweler, then add the insurance cost.

The cost of the material is $500.
The cost of the jeweler is $800.
The total cost before insurance is $500 + $800 = $1300.
The insurance cost is 10% of $1300, which is 0.1 x $1300 = $130.
The total amount Janet paid is $1300 + $130 = $1430.

The final answer is: $1430"
"To find Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we first need to calculate the value of the pension after 30 years. Since she gets 5% of the value of the pension per year after 20 years, we can calculate the value of the pension after 30 years as follows:

The pension after 30 years will be the initial pension of $50,000/year for 10 years (30 - 20 = 10) plus 5% of the initial pension for 20 years.

The value of the pension after 10 years remains the same as the initial pension, which is $50,000/year. 

For the next 20 years, she gets 5% of the initial pension, which is 0.05 * $50,000 = $2,500/year.

To find the total value of the pension after 30 years, we add the value of the pension for the first 10 years and the value of the pension for the next 20 years:

$50,000/year * 10 years = $500,000
$2,500/year * 20 years = $50,000
Total value of the pension after 30 years = $500,000 + $50,000 = $550,000

Now, we need to find 5% of the total value of the pension after 30 years to get her annual pension:

5% of $550,000 = 0.05 * $550,000 = $27,500

So, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be $27,500. 

$27,500"
"To find the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to calculate the amount she paid for the first half and the second half of the year separately and then add them together.

The streaming service charges $140 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the first half of the year consists of 6 months. 

The amount she paid for the first half of the year is 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, the company charges 10% less than the initial amount. To find the amount charged for the second half, we need to calculate 10% of $140 and subtract it from $140.

10% of $140 = 0.1 * $140 = $14

The amount charged for the second half of the year is $140 - $14 = $126.

The amount she paid for the second half of the year is 6 * $126 = $756.

The total amount she paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $840 + $756 = $1596.

The final answer is: $1596"
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to determine the car's miles per gallon (mpg) rating. We can do this by dividing the distance traveled since the last fill-up (100 miles) by the amount of gas used (4 gallons).

mpg = distance / gas used
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know the car's mpg rating, we can calculate the total distance Sophia can drive on a full tank by multiplying the tank capacity (12 gallons) by the mpg rating.

total distance = tank capacity * mpg
total distance = 12 gallons * 25 miles/gallon
total distance = 300 miles

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

"To find the total time spent on TV and reading, we first need to calculate the time spent on each activity per week. 

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV. 
He then reads for half as long, which is 2 / 2 = 1 hour.

So, the total time spent on TV and reading per day is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent per week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

To find the total time spent in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly time by 4: 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

"To find the total number of people sent by the schools, we need to calculate the total number of students and coaches.

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players. So, the total number of students from each school is 2 teams * 5 players/team = 10 players.

Each school also has 2 coaches, one for each team. 

Now, we multiply the number of students and coaches from each school to get the total number of people from each school: 10 students + 2 coaches = 12 people per school.

"To find out how much Shiela will pay each month, we need to calculate the total cost of the cell phones first, and then divide it by the number of months.

The total cost of the cell phones is 5 units * $150/unit = $750.

Since a 2% interest will be charged for each unit, the total interest for 5 units is 5 * 2% = 10% of the total cost.

The total interest is 10% of $750 = 0.1 * $750 = $75.

So, the total amount Shiela needs to pay is $750 (cost) + $75 (interest) = $825.

"To find the total number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total number of cups of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year and then divide it by the number of cups in a bag.

First, let's calculate the number of cups the puppy will eat in the first 180 days. Since the puppy eats 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days, the total number of cups will be 180 * 1 = 180 cups.

Next, we need to calculate the number of cups the puppy will eat for the rest of its life. Since the first year has 365 days, and the puppy has already eaten for 180 days, the remaining days in the first year are 365 - 180 = 185 days. The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of its life, so the total number of cups for the remaining days will be 185 * 2 = 370 cups.

Now, we add the cups eaten in the first 180 days and the cups eaten for the rest of the year to get the total cups eaten in the first year: 180 + 370 = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we can find the total number of bags by dividing the total cups eaten in the first year by the number of cups in a bag: 550 / 110 = 5.

Initial salary: $600
Annual increase: 10% of $600 = 0.10 * $600 = $60
Salary after one year: $600 + $60 = $660
Salary after two years: $660 + $66 (10% of $660) = $726
Salary after three years: $726 + $72.60 (10% of $726) = $798.60
Salary after four years: $798.60 + $79.86 (10% of $798.60) = $878.46
Salary after five years: $878.46 + $87.85 (10% of $878.46) = $966.31

Now, we need to calculate the salary for the next three years. Since the increase is 10% of the initial salary, we will use the initial salary of $600 for the next three years.

"To find out how many gift bags Christina needs, we first need to calculate the number of guests who will actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, we can find the number of guests who will attend by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of invited guests.

Number of invited guests = 16
Number of guests who don't show up = 1/4 * 16 = 4
Number of guests who will attend = 16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we can multiply the number of guests who will attend by 0.75 to find the total number of gift bags needed.

Number of gift bags needed = 12 * 0.75 = 9

The final answer is: 28"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.
2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.
3. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can set up an equation:

Time taken by Gerald = Time taken by Lee + 2 seconds
Time taken by Gerald = 38 + 2
Time taken by Gerald = 40 seconds

Now, we know Gerald's speed improved by 10% after his diet change. To find his new time, we need to calculate 10% of his original time and subtract it from his original time.

10% of 40 seconds = 0.1 * 40 = 4 seconds
New time taken by Gerald = Original time - (10% of original time)
New time taken by Gerald = 40 - 4
New time taken by Gerald = 36 seconds

The final answer is: 36"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

We know that the number of dogs is 60. Since there are two cats for every dog, the number of cats can be calculated as follows:

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
= 2 * 60
= 120

We are also given that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. Let's denote the combined number of dogs and cats as D + C, where D is the number of dogs and C is the number of cats.

Number of rabbits = D + C - 12
= 60 + 120 - 12
= 168

Now, to find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
= 60 + 120 + 168
= 348

The final answer is: 348"
"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls and then subtract the number of girls in the girl scout.

First, let's find the number of boys and girls. We know that 2/5 of the students are boys. 

Number of boys = (2/5) * 200 = 80

Since there are 200 students in total, the number of girls can be found by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students.

Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

Now, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = (2/3) * 120 = 80

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Number of girls not in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many hours James slept, we need to calculate 2/3 of the hours Harry slept. 

Harry slept 9 hours, so 2/3 of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6 hours. 

Now, we need to find the difference between the hours Harry and James slept. Harry slept 9 hours and James slept 6 hours. 

9 - 6 = 3

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we first need to determine the total volume of the tomatoes before they were cooked. Since the sauce made 32 ounces and it's half the volume of the tomatoes, the total volume of the tomatoes must be 32 * 2 = 64 ounces.

Since each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces, we can divide the total volume of the tomatoes by the volume of each can to find out how many cans were used: 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes used is 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to first determine the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam. 

We know that 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. 

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as 'x'. Since 5 cars took an exit, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the original number of cars minus the ones that took an exit, which is 30 - 5 = 25.

We also know that the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the ones that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 20 = 25

To solve for 'x', we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

x = 25 - 20
x = 5

However, this is the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, but it doesn't account for the fact that some cars drove through in the first 15 minutes. Since the problem states that some cars drove through in the first 15 minutes, we can infer that the 5 cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes are part of the original 30 cars. 

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we first need to determine the total number of potted plants she has initially. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so the total number of potted plants she has is 2 * 40 = 80.

She received 18 new potted plants from the nursery, so now she has 80 + 18 = 98 potted plants.

Tomorrow, she will give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to her friends and family, so she will give away 40 potted plants.

To find out how many potted plants she will have left, we subtract the number of potted plants she gave away from the total number of potted plants she had: 98 - 40 = 58.

The final answer is: 58"
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and add them up.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. 
1/4 of 20 is 5, so the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
We are given that the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, we add up the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell: 
20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 70 (third friend) + 60 (fourth friend) = 175

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."
"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read in total, we need to add up the pages from all the textbooks. 

Pages from Science textbook: 4
Pages from Social Studies textbook: 20
Pages from History textbook: 7
Pages from Geography textbook: 8

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39

Since Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, we need to subtract those from the total pages to find out how many pages are left to read.

Pages left to read = Total pages - Pages already read
= 39 - 15
= 24

Solo has 4 more days to complete all his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average in one day, we need to divide the pages left to read by the number of days.

Pages to read per day = Pages left to read / Number of days
= 24 / 4
= 6

So, Solo needs to read 6 pages on average in one day. 

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately and then add them together.

On weekdays, John drinks 4 glasses of water (one with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and one before bed). Since there are 5 weekdays, he drinks 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 1 glass of soda with dinner, but he still drinks 3 glasses of water (with breakfast, lunch, and before bed). Since there are 2 weekend days, he drinks 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water on weekends.

Now, let's add the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays and weekends: 20 (weekdays) + 6 (weekends) = 26.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how many minutes it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to determine how many 3-mile sections the city is divided into and then multiply that by the time it takes to cover each section.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

To find the number of 3-mile sections, we divide the total distance by the length of each section: 42 miles / 3 miles per section = 14 sections.

Now, we multiply the number of sections by the time it takes to cover each section: 14 sections * 10 minutes per section = 140 minutes.

The final answer is: 140"
"To find out how many pieces are left to be placed, we first need to determine how many pieces Poppy and her mom have placed together. 

Poppy places a quarter of the 1000 pieces, which is 1000 * 0.25 = 250 pieces. 

Now, there are 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left. 

Her mom places a third of the remaining 750 pieces, which is 750 * (1/3) = 250 pieces. 

So, the total number of pieces placed is 250 (by Poppy) + 250 (by her mom) = 500 pieces.

Now, to find out how many pieces are left, we subtract the total placed from the original 1000 pieces: 1000 - 500 = 500.

The final answer is: 500"
"To find out how many cookies Cody eats, we need to multiply the number of cookies Amir eats by 3. 

Amir eats 5 cookies, so Cody eats 5 * 3 = 15 cookies.

Now, to find the total number of cookies they eat together, we need to add the number of cookies Amir eats and the number of cookies Cody eats.

Total cookies = 5 (Amir's cookies) + 15 (Cody's cookies) = 20

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to find the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The dimensions of the box are given as 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick. This means the inner dimensions will be (5-2) inches by (6-2) inches by (4-2) inches, which is 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches.

The formula to find the volume of a rectangular prism is length * width * height. 

So, the inner volume of one box is 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is 3 * 24 = 72 cubic inches.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 2 episodes of a 1-hour show, which is a total of 2 hours. 

On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's call the number of episodes 'x'. The total time he watched on Wednesday is 30x minutes, which is equal to 0.5x hours.

On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is a total of 1.5 hours.

On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is a total of 2 hours.

The total time he watched is 7 hours. We can set up an equation to represent this:

2 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7

Combine like terms:

5.5 + 0.5x = 7

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

0.5x = 1.5

Divide both sides by 0.5:

x = 3

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as 'x'. Since Henry wants to make twice as many as he did last year, he plans to bake 2x cookies this year.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has a total of 110 cookies. This can be represented as (2x + 15) - 5 = 110.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 10 = 110.

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation, we get 2x = 100.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get x = 50.

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of gas without the rewards, and then subtract the cashback amount.

The cost of gas per gallon is $3.00, and the person is buying 10 gallons. 

Total cost of gas = cost per gallon * number of gallons
Total cost of gas = $3.00 * 10
Total cost of gas = $30.00

The cashback reward is $0.20 per gallon, and the person is buying 10 gallons.

Total cashback = cashback per gallon * number of gallons
Total cashback = $0.20 * 10
Total cashback = $2.00

Now, we subtract the total cashback from the total cost of gas to find the final cost.

Final cost = Total cost of gas - Total cashback
Final cost = $30.00 - $2.00
Final cost = $28.00

The final answer is: $28.00"
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by each, we need to multiply the width by the length of each roll-up. 

Beatrice's roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 rolls long, so the total number of roll-ups she ate is 2 * 24 = 48.

Marcell's roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 rolls long, so the total number of roll-ups he ate is 3 * 14 = 42.

To find the average number of roll-ups eaten by each, we need to add the total number of roll-ups eaten by each and divide by 2. 

Total roll-ups eaten = 48 + 42 = 90
Average roll-ups eaten = 90 / 2 = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to calculate the total amount of water taken on per second and then multiply it by the total time taken to reach the shore.

First, let's find the rate at which the boat is taking on water. It takes 2 liters for every 10 feet, and it takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet. 

Since 20 feet is twice 10 feet, the boat will take on twice the amount of water, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters in 16 seconds.

Now, let's find the rate of water intake per second. 4 liters in 16 seconds is 4/16 = 0.25 liters per second.

The total time taken to reach the shore is 64 seconds. So, the total amount of water taken on is 0.25 liters/second * 64 seconds = 16 liters.

The final answer is: 16"

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
2. Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.
3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

From point 1, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, then Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

From point 2, we know that Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Since Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs, the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo is 300 / 50 = 6.

"To find the total cost of the lumber, we need to calculate the cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards and the 4 x 4 x 10 boards separately and then add them together.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $10 per board = $100.

The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $16 per board = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the lumber is 1.5 times the original price. 

The new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 per board.
The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 per board.

The total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $15 per board = $150.
The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $24 per board = $120.

The total revenue is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we first need to find the total number of vehicles that were already present at the port. We know that there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles initially is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we know that the total number of vehicles at the port became 30 after the second day. To find the number of vehicles brought in on the second day, we subtract the initial number of vehicles from the total number of vehicles: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers brought in on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles brought in by the number of vehicles per container: 20 / 5 = 4.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find Lylah's salary four years ago. 

Let's assume Lylah's salary four years ago was 'x'. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can express Adrien's salary as 1.3x. We are given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, so we can set up the equation:

1.3x = 40000

To find 'x', we can divide both sides by 1.3:

x = 40000 / 1.3
x = 30769.23

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30769.23.

Now, we need to find Adrien's salary four years later. We are given that his salary increased by 40% of his original salary. We can express this as:

New salary = Original salary + (40% of Original salary)
= 40000 + (0.4 * 40000)
= 40000 + 16000
= 56000

Now, we need to find Lylah's salary four years later. Since their salaries increased simultaneously, we can assume the percentage increase in their salaries is the same. We can express Lylah's new salary as:

New salary = Original salary + (40% of Original salary)
= 30769.23 + (0.4 * 30769.23)
= 30769.23 + 12307.69
= 43076.92

Now, we can find the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later by adding their new salaries:

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
= 56000 + 43076.92
= 99076.92

The final answer is: $99077"

"To find the total number of fruits, we first need to determine the number of fruits each person brought. 

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. 

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, so Kael brought 2 * 5 = 10 apples. 
Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, so Kael brought 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

Now, we need to find the total number of fruits each person brought. 
Morisette brought 5 + 8 = 13 fruits. 
Kael brought 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of fruits each person brought. 
13 (Morisette's fruits) + 14 (Kael's fruits) = 27

"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate the hours she slept on each day and add them up.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

The rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday) she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours she slept for each day:

- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours
- Thursday: 7 hours

"To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour.

First, let's calculate the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. 

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's calculate the remaining time after 3 hours. 
Total time = 7 hours
Time already run = 3 hours
Remaining time = Total time - Time already run
Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours
Remaining time = 4 hours

Now, let's calculate the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours.

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distances she ran at both speeds to find the total distance.

Total distance = Distance at 10 mph + Distance at 5 mph
Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total distance = 50 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many letters Jennie stamped and then subtract that from the total number of letters that were already stamped when she began.

We know that Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. Since there are 60 letters needing stamps, one-third of that is 60 / 3 = 20 letters.

Now, we know that after Jennie stamped 20 letters, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This means that before Jennie started, there were 30 - 20 = 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.

So, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began was 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Julia initially had 0 spoons (since she was out of them).
2. She bought a package of spoons, but we don't know the quantity yet. Let's call this quantity 'x'.
3. Her husband bought 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia, so now she has x + 5 spoons.
4. Julia used 3 spoons while making the stew, so she has (x + 5) - 3 spoons left.
5. When she set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons. This means that (x + 5) - 3 = 12.
6. Now, let's solve the equation: x + 5 - 3 = 12
   x + 2 = 12
   x = 12 - 2
   x = 10

So, Julia bought a package of 10 spoons.

"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages. 

First, let's find the number of fish sausages. Since Dylan bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, we can add 6 to the number of chicken sausages: 38 + 6 = 44.

Now, we can add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages to find the total: 38 + 44 = 82.

The final answer is: 82"
"To find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we first need to determine the number of friends Amy has. Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily has 50 friends, we can calculate Amy's friends by adding 20 to Lily's friends.

Amy's friends = Lily's friends + 20
Amy's friends = 50 + 20
Amy's friends = 70

Now, to find the total number of friends they have together, we add the number of friends Lily and Amy have.

Total friends = Lily's friends + Amy's friends
Total friends = 50 + 70
Total friends = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them up.

First, let's find the cost of a watermelon. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs $15, a watermelon costs 3 * $15 = $45.

Next, we find the cost of an orange. An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so an orange costs $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each item:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

Adding these costs together, we get: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880

"To find the total profit, we first need to calculate the total time spent by doctors and the total amount charged to patients.

The hospital sees 500 people a day, and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. 

First, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 
24 minutes = 24/60 hours = 0.4 hours

The total time spent by doctors is the number of patients multiplied by the time per patient.
Total time spent by doctors = 500 patients * 0.4 hours/patient = 200 hours

The hospital charges $150 an hour to the doctors, so the total cost to the hospital is:
Total cost to the hospital = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

The hospital charges $200 an hour to the patients. The total time spent by patients is the same as the time spent by doctors, which is 200 hours. 
Total revenue from patients = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000

The profit made by the hospital is the total revenue from patients minus the total cost to the hospital.
Profit = Total revenue from patients - Total cost to the hospital
Profit = $40,000 - $30,000
Profit = $10,000

The final answer is: $10,000"
"To find the number of elves left, we first need to calculate the number of elves who quit after the children vomit on them. Since a third of the elves quit, we can find this by dividing the total number of elves by 3.

60 / 3 = 20 elves quit after the children vomit on them.

Now, we subtract these 20 elves from the total to find the remaining number of elves.

60 - 20 = 40 elves left

Then, 10 more elves quit after kids kick their shins. We subtract these 10 elves from the remaining 40.

40 - 10 = 30 elves left

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total expenditure for the two months, we need to add the expenditure in May and June. 

The expenditure in May was $500. 
The expenditure in June was $60 less than May, so it is $500 - $60 = $440.

Now, let's add the expenditure for both months: $500 + $440 = $940.

The final answer is: $940"
"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the total number of rides taken by Pam and Fred and then multiply it by the cost of each ride.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she took a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he took a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

The total number of rides taken by both Pam and Fred is 4 + 6 = 10 rides.

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is 10 * 6 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we first need to determine how many miles he walked on Tuesday. 

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. 
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, which is 4 * 6 = 24 miles.

Now, we know that his total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. We already know that he walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday. 

So, the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles. 

To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday: 41 - 28 = 13 miles.

The final answer is: 13"

Tom gets 4 car washes a month, and each car wash costs $15. 

The total cost per month is 4 car washes * $15/car wash = $60/month.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total cost per year is $60/month * 12 months = $720/year.

The final answer is: $720"
"To find out how many video games Bobby has, we first need to determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5. 

Brian initially has 20 video games but lost 5, so he has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. To find out how many video games Bobby has, we multiply Brian's remaining video games by 3 and then subtract 5.

3 times Brian's remaining video games is 3 * 15 = 45.

5 fewer than 45 is 45 - 5 = 40.

Bobby has 40 video games.

"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we first need to find the total number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of unicorns in Scottish Highlands = 27 * (1/3)
= 27 * 1/3
= 9

Now, we know that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. So, we can calculate the number of female Scottish unicorns as follows:

Number of female Scottish unicorns = 9 * (2/3)
= 9 * 2/3
= 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we need to calculate the cost of the items, add the delivery fee, and then add the tip.

First, let's calculate the cost of the items:
- 2 subs for $7.50 each: 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
- 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each: 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
- 2 cookies for $1.00 each: 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
Total cost of items: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, let's calculate the delivery fee: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00

Now, let's add the delivery fee to the total cost of items: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, let's add the $5.00 tip: $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

"To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we first need to calculate how many questions he completed in each test.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 

Time taken to complete the first test = Total questions / Rate per hour
Time taken to complete the first test = 75 / 5
Time taken to complete the first test = 15 hours

Since Mark only had 8 hours, he didn't complete the first test. Let's calculate how many questions he completed in 8 hours.
Questions completed in 8 hours = Rate per hour * Time
Questions completed in 8 hours = 5 * 8
Questions completed in 8 hours = 40

Now, let's calculate how many questions he left incomplete in the first test.
Questions left incomplete in the first test = Total questions - Questions completed
Questions left incomplete in the first test = 75 - 40
Questions left incomplete in the first test = 35

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour.

Time taken to complete the second test = Total questions / Rate per hour
Time taken to complete the second test = 100 / 5
Time taken to complete the second test = 20 hours

Since Mark only had 6 hours, he didn't complete the second test. Let's calculate how many questions he completed in 6 hours.
Questions completed in 6 hours = Rate per hour * Time
Questions completed in 6 hours = 5 * 6
Questions completed in 6 hours = 30

Now, let's calculate how many questions he left incomplete in the second test.
Questions left incomplete in the second test = Total questions - Questions completed
Questions left incomplete in the second test = 100 - 30
Questions left incomplete in the second test = 70

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine the total number of semi-automatic cars. 

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars by dividing the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

"Let's break down the information given. 

Let's denote the number of baby bees as B, the number of worker bees as W, and the number of queens as Q. 

We know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B. 

We also know that there are twice as many babies as queens, so B = 2Q.

We are given that the total number of bees is 700, so W + B + Q = 700.

Substituting W = 2B and B = 2Q into the total equation, we get 2B + B + Q = 700, which simplifies to 3B + Q = 700.

Since B = 2Q, we can substitute this into the equation to get 3(2Q) + Q = 700, which simplifies to 6Q + Q = 700, or 7Q = 700.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100.

Now that we know Q = 100, we can find B by substituting Q into the equation B = 2Q, which gives us B = 2(100) = 200.

Finally, we can find W by substituting B into the equation W = 2B, which gives us W = 2(200) = 400.

The final answer is: 400"
"To find out how much money Jordan would earn in one week, we need to calculate the total hours he would work in a week and then multiply it by his hourly wage.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, if he spent his video game time working instead, he would work 2 hours more each day. 

There are 7 days in a week, so the total hours he would work in a week is 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours.

His hourly wage is $10, so the total amount he would earn in a week is 14 hours * $10/hour = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of food items and non-food items separately and then add the tax to the non-food items.

Food items: milk and eggs
Cost of milk = 2 dollars
Cost of eggs = 3 dollars
Total cost of food items = 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Non-food items: light bulbs, cups, and roach traps
Cost of light bulbs = 3 dollars
Cost of cups = 3 dollars
Cost of roach traps = 4 dollars
Total cost of non-food items = 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount.
Tax amount = 10% of 10 dollars = 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of non-food items.
Total cost of non-food items with tax = 10 + 1 = 11 dollars

Now, we add the cost of food items and non-food items with tax to get the total cost.
Total cost = 5 + 11 = 16 dollars

"To calculate the total profit, we first need to determine the total income and total expenses. 

Kim has 3 current clients and 5 potential clients, making a total of 8 clients. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. 

Total bottles of bleach needed per week = 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed per week = 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

The cost of bleach per week = 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
The cost of cloths per week = 8 packs * $5/pack = $40

Total expenses per week = $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72

Since Kim's total income per week is $92, we can calculate the profit as follows:

Profit per week = Total income - Total expenses
Profit per week = $92 - $72
Profit per week = $20

"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we first need to calculate the total number of pineapples in his field. 

Since John has 10 hectares of a pineapple field and there are 100 pineapples per hectare, we can multiply the number of hectares by the number of pineapples per hectare to get the total number of pineapples.

Total pineapples = 10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we need to find out how many 3-month periods are in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so we can divide 12 by 3 to get the number of 3-month periods.

12 months/year / 3 months/period = 4 periods/year

Now, we can multiply the total number of pineapples by the number of periods to find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year.

Pineapples harvested/year = 1000 pineapples * 4 periods/year = 4000 pineapples

The final answer is: 4000"

Initially, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.

In the next 6 hours, half of the bees that left return, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.

In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees leave the hive as the number that left initially, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.

So, the total number of bees that left the hive before the last 6 hours is 30 (initially) + 60 (in the next 6 hours) = 90 bees.

Since all the bees that left before the last 6 hours return in the last 6 hours, the number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is 90.

12 = 3 * Dorothy's friends

To find out how many friends Dorothy has, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

Dorothy's friends = 12 / 3
Dorothy's friends = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find out how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. So, we can set up another equation:

"To find out who will win the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distance from miles to feet for both Steve and Tim. Since 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet, we can convert their distances as follows:

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school:

Steve's time: distance / speed = 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: distance / speed = 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes to get home and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will win the race. To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to subtract the winner's time from the loser's time:

Waiting time = Tim's time - Steve's time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

"To find out how much Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating all the tires. 

First, let's calculate the cost of inflating the bicycle tires. Each bicycle has 2 tires, and there were 5 bicycles. So, the total number of bicycle tires is 5 * 2 = 10. The cost of inflating each tire is 25 cents, so the total cost for the bicycle tires is 10 * 25 cents = 250 cents. 

Next, let's calculate the cost of inflating the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and there were 3 tricycles. So, the total number of tricycle tires is 3 * 3 = 9. The cost of inflating each tire is 25 cents, so the total cost for the tricycle tires is 9 * 25 cents = 225 cents.

Now, let's calculate the cost of inflating the unicycle tire. A unicycle has 1 tire, and there was 1 unicycle. So, the total number of unicycle tires is 1 * 1 = 1. The cost of inflating each tire is 25 cents, so the total cost for the unicycle tire is 1 * 25 cents = 25 cents.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the tires: 250 cents + 225 cents + 25 cents = 500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100. So, 500 cents is equal to 500 / 100 = 5 dollars.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Dave ate 14 french fries initially.
2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   Now, the total amount eaten by Dave and the seagull is 14 + 7 = 21 french fries.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 french fries.
   Now, the total amount eaten is 21 + 9 = 30 french fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries. Let's denote the initial amount of fries as 'x'. 
   After the seagull and pigeons ate, the remaining amount is x - 30.
   The raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is (2/3) * (x - 30).
   The remaining amount after the raccoon is (x - 30) - (2/3) * (x - 30).
   Simplifying this, we get (1/3) * (x - 30).
5. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 behind. 
   So, the remaining amount after the raccoon is (1/3) * (x - 30) - 1 = 5.
   Now, we can solve for 'x'.
   (1/3) * (x - 30) = 6
   x - 30 = 18
   x = 48

"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he's running back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. 

To find the total distance Kelly ran, we add the initial 200 yards to the distance she ran to the 40-yard line and back: 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Now, we compare the distances: Blake ran 3000 yards, and Kelly ran 2920 yards. Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

Initial price = $20
Increase percentage = 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4
New price after 2 months = $20 + $4 = $24
Increase percentage = 20% of $24 = 0.20 * $24 = $4.80
New price after 4 months = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80
Increase percentage = 20% of $28.80 = 0.20 * $28.80 = $5.76
New price after 6 months = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56
Increase percentage = 20% of $34.56 = 0.20 * $34.56 = $6.912
New price after 8 months = $34.56 + $6.912 = $41.472
Increase percentage = 20% of $41.472 = 0.20 * $41.472 = $8.2944
New price after 10 months = $41.472 + $8.2944 = $49.7664

"To find the total worth of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then add them up.

The doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Since an action figure costs $5, the doll costs 3 * $5 = $15.

One red car costs $4. Since there are 5 red cars, the total cost of the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

The total cost of the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the toys: $15 (doll) + $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) = $50.

The total worth of all the toys is $50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference in income between the two options.

If Jackie does her taxes herself, she'll lose $35/hour in missed income for 3 hours of freelance work. So, the total income lost is $35/hour * 3 hours = $105.

The cost of hiring the accountant is $90.

Now, let's calculate the difference in income between the two options. If Jackie hires the accountant, she won't lose any income from missed freelance work, so her income will be $0. If she does her taxes herself, she'll lose $105 in income.

The difference in income is $105 (lost income) - $90 (accountant's fee) = $15.

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer accessories and subtract that from her budget.

The total cost of the computer accessories is:
- Computer: €1090
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1323

Now, let's subtract the total cost from Elvira's budget:
Budget = €1500
Total cost = €1323

Money left for clothing = Budget - Total cost
= €1500 - €1323
= €177

So, Elvira will have €177 left for her clothing. 

The final answer is: €177"
"To find out how many times Sandra has to babysit, we need to determine how many eggs she needs in total to make 15 Spanish flans and then divide that by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job.

Since each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs, Sandra will need 15 * 3 = 45 eggs in total.

Since Sandra gets 9 eggs every time she babysits, we can divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysit: 45 / 9 = 5.

So, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to get enough eggs to make 15 Spanish flans.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's assume Brooke's current age is 'x'. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age is '2x'.

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be 'x + 2' and Seth's age will be '2x + 2'. According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. So, we can write the equation:

(x + 2) + (2x + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3x + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3x = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 8

Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age is 2x, which is 2 * 8 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to first determine what ""twice the money Ethel has"" is. Since Ethel has $8, twice that amount would be 2 * 8 = 16.

Jimmy has $18."
"To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he walks in a week. 

There are 7 days in a week. Pancho walks 20 miles a day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, the total miles he walks from Monday to Friday is 20 * 5 = 100 miles.

On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. So, the total miles he walks on weekends is 10 * 2 = 20 miles.

Now, let's add the miles he walks from Monday to Friday and the miles he walks on weekends. Total miles = 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants separately and then add them together.

The cost of the hat is given as $25.

The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so it is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. The average cost of the pants is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red.
2. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four.
3. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, and Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.

From point 3, we know Sally Four is 8 years old. 

From point 2, we can calculate Granny Red's age: 
Granny Red's age = 2 * Sally Four's age
Granny Red's age = 2 * 8
Granny Red's age = 16

From point 1, we can calculate Sally Two's age: 
Sally Two's age = Granny Red's age + 3
Sally Two's age = 16 + 3
Sally Two's age = 19

Now, we know the ages of Sally Four, Sally Two, and Granny Red. We still need to find the age of the fourth bird, but there's no information about the fourth bird's age. However, the question asks for the total age of the four birds. Since we have three out of four birds' ages, we can calculate the total age of the three birds we know and assume the fourth bird's age is unknown for now.

Total age of Sally Four, Sally Two, and Granny Red = Sally Four's age + Sally Two's age + Granny Red's age
Total age of Sally Four, Sally Two, and Granny Red = 8 + 19 + 16
Total age of Sally Four, Sally Two, and Granny Red = 43

Since we don't have information about the fourth bird's age, we can't calculate the total age of all four birds. However, the question might be asking for the total age of the three birds we know, or it might be missing information about the fourth bird's age. Without more information, we can only provide the total age of the three birds we know.

However, if we assume the question is asking for the total age of all four birds, we would need more information about the fourth bird's age.

But, if we are to provide a numerical answer based on the information given, we can only provide the total age of the three birds we know.

"To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we first need to calculate the increased minimum payments for each debt. 

The increased minimum payment for the student loans is 50% more than $300, which is 1.5 * $300 = $450. 
The increased minimum payment for the credit card is 50% more than $200, which is 1.5 * $200 = $300. 
The increased minimum payment for the mortgage is 50% more than $500, which is 1.5 * $500 = $750.

Now, we add up the increased minimum payments for each debt to find the total monthly payment: $450 + $300 + $750 = $1500.

To find the total payment in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12: $1500 * 12 = $18,000.

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To find the total time it takes Billy to peel and cut all the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes, and then add the time it takes to cut one potato multiplied by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds = 5/60 minutes (converting seconds to minutes)

Total time to peel all potatoes: 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes/potato = 90 minutes
Total time to cut all potatoes: 60 potatoes * (5/60) minutes/potato = 5 minutes

Adding both times together: 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the number of gallons they made as 'g'. 

The cost of lemons and sugar for each gallon is $3 + $2 = $5. 
The revenue from selling each gallon is 20 glasses * $0.50 = $10. 
The profit from each gallon is $10 - $5 = $5. 
Since they made a total profit of $25, the number of gallons they made is $25 / $5 = 5 gallons.

The total cost of lemons for 5 gallons is 5 gallons * $3 = $15.

Chinese participants = 240 - 80
Chinese participants = 160

Now, we know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of girls on the Chinese team = Chinese participants - Number of boys
Number of girls on the Chinese team = 160 - 60
Number of girls on the Chinese team = 100

"To find out how much money Zaid has left after all these expenses and donations, we need to follow the order of operations.

First, let's calculate the amount Zaid spends on rent: 1/4 of 6000 is 6000 * 1/4 = 1500.

Next, let's calculate the amount Zaid spends on car fuel: 1/3 of 6000 is 6000 * 1/3 = 2000.

Now, let's subtract the rent and car fuel expenses from Zaid's monthly income: 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500.

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity: 2500 * 1/2 = 1250.

Now, let's subtract the donation from the remaining amount: 2500 - 1250 = 1250.

Zaid gives his daughter 200 and his wife 700, so the total amount given to them is 200 + 700 = 900.

Now, let's subtract the total amount given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount: 1250 - 900 = 350.

Therefore, Zaid will have 350 dollars left after all these expenses and donations.

The final answer is: 350"

Total votes = 80
Winner's votes = 3/4 * Total votes
Winner's votes = 3/4 * 80
Winner's votes = 60

Now, to find the number of votes the loser got, we subtract the winner's votes from the total votes:

Loser's votes = Total votes - Winner's votes
Loser's votes = 80 - 60
Loser's votes = 20

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses is 4x.

We are also given that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, so the number of pink calla lilies is 5x.

We know that the total number of flowers ordered is the sum of red roses, white carnations, and pink calla lilies. However, we are not given the total number of flowers ordered. But we do know that the missing red roses are the only ones that need to be delivered by 5 pm.

Since we don't have the total number of flowers, we can't directly calculate the number of red roses. However, we can express the number of red roses in terms of x.

The number of red roses = 4x

Since we don't have any other information about the total number of flowers, we can't calculate the exact number of red roses. However, we can express it in terms of x.

But, we can use the information that Sandra has threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm. This implies that the missing red roses are the only ones that need to be delivered by 5 pm.

Since we don't have any other information about the total number of flowers, we can't calculate the exact number of red roses. However, we can express it in terms of x.

But, we can use the information that Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. This implies that the number of white carnations is 200/5 = 40.

Now we can calculate the number of red roses. The number of red roses = 4x = 4 * 40 = 160.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

Let's denote Mark's current age as M and Jean's current age as J. We know that J = M + 2.

Two years ago, Mark was M - 2 years old, and Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old. We are also given that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. This can be written as:

M - 2 = (1/2) * 28 + 5

Simplifying the equation:

M - 2 = 14 + 5
M - 2 = 19
M = 21

Now that we know Mark's age, we can find Jean's age by adding 2 to Mark's age:

J = M + 2
J = 21 + 2
J = 23

"To find the total time for each team, we need to calculate the time taken by each team to complete the 4-lap relay.

The well-rounded team has each member running 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are 4 members, the total time for the well-rounded team is 4 * 55 = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner takes 60 seconds. The subsequent runners are 3 seconds faster than the previous one, so the second runner takes 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, the third runner takes 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth runner takes 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. The total time for the less well-rounded team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, and then find the difference between these two probabilities.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is the probability of rolling a 4, 5, or 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5, since there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25 or 25%.

Now, we need to find the difference between these two probabilities. The difference is 50% - 25% = 25%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"

"To find the number of rats in each cage, we first need to determine the total number of small rodents (rats and hamsters) and the total number of straw pieces given to them. 

Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'r'. Since there are 3 cages of rats, the total number of rats is 3r. 

The total number of hamsters is 10. Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw given to hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

The total number of straw given to small rodents (rats and hamsters) is 160. Since 50 pieces are given to hamsters, the remaining straw is given to rats. So, the total straw given to rats is 160 - 50 = 110.

Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, and there are 3 cages of rats. The total number of straw given to rats is 3r * 6 = 18r. 

Since the total straw given to rats is 110, we can set up the equation 18r = 110. 

To find the value of 'r', we can divide both sides of the equation by 18: r = 110 / 18.

r = 6.11 (approximately)

However, since the number of rats must be a whole number, we need to find the closest whole number that satisfies the equation. 

We can try different values of 'r' to find the closest whole number. 

Let's try r = 6: 18 * 6 = 108 (less than 110)

Let's try r = 7: 18 * 7 = 126 (greater than 110)

Since r = 6 results in a value less than 110 and r = 7 results in a value greater than 110, the number of rats in each cage must be between 6 and 7.

However, since the problem states that the rats are kept in equal groups, we can try r = 6.11, which is not a whole number. But we can round it to the nearest whole number, which is 6 or 7.

Let's try r = 6: 18 * 6 = 108 (less than 110)

However, we can also consider the fact that the total number of straw given to rats is 110, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. We can divide 110 by 6 to find the total number of rats: 110 / 6 = 18.33 (approximately).

Since the number of rats must be a whole number, we can round 18.33 to the nearest whole number, which is 18. However, this would result in a total of 18 * 6 = 108 straw pieces, which is less than 110.

"To calculate the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months and add it to the principal amount.

The monthly interest rate is 2%, which is 0.02 as a decimal. 

The principal amount is $100.

The interest for the first month is $100 * 0.02 = $2.
The interest for the second month is $102 * 0.02 = $2.04.
The interest for the third month is $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808.

The total interest is $2 + $2.04 + $2.0808 = $6.1208.

The total amount Mandy should pay is the principal amount plus the total interest: $100 + $6.1208 = $106.1208.

Rounding to two decimal places, the total amount Mandy should pay is $106.12.

The final answer is: $106.12"
"To find the number of bags the trader sold, we need to first calculate the total cost and total revenue. 

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The total cost of buying the bags is $20x (since each bag costs $20).
The total cost of transportation is $2x (since each bag costs $2 to transport).
The total cost is the sum of the buying cost and transportation cost, which is $20x + $2x = $22x.

The total revenue from selling the bags is $30x (since each bag is sold at $30).

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $30x - $22x = $8x.

We are given that the profit is $400, so we can set up the equation $8x = $400.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 8:
x = $400 / $8
x = 50

So, the trader sold 50 bags. 

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide it by 3.

First, let's find the cost of the food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. Since they spent $20.25 on tickets, the cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

The cost of the rides is 2 rides * $33 per ride = $66.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

Since they split the cost evenly, each friend paid $102 / 3 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"To find out how many peaches John collects, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he collects peaches and then multiply it by the number of peaches he collects per minute.

Since John collects peaches for 3 hours, we need to convert the time to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, we know John collects 2 peaches per minute. To find the total number of peaches collected, we multiply the total minutes by the peaches collected per minute:

180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

So, John collects 360 peaches.

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ducks needs per day, we first need to calculate the total pounds of insects needed per week for the entire flock. 

Since each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, and there are ten ducks, the total pounds of insects needed per week is 3.5 pounds/duck * 10 ducks = 35 pounds/week.

To find out how many pounds of insects the flock needs per day, we need to divide the total pounds of insects needed per week by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week). 

35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of trees Tom has left, we need to calculate the net change in the number of trees over 10 years.

Initially, Tom has 50 trees.

Each year, he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees. So, the net change in trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8.

Over 10 years, the net change in trees is 8 * 10 = 80.

So, the total number of trees after 10 years is 50 + 80 = 130.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we multiply 130 by 0.3 (which is 30% as a decimal).

Number of trees that die = 130 * 0.3 = 39.

Now, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years to find the final number of trees.

Number of trees left = 130 - 39 = 91.

The final answer is: 91"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos on Sue's front yard.

On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out on Sue's front yard. So, now there are 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. Now, there are 18 + 12 = 30 pink flamingos.

The total number of flamingos is 30 (pink) + 6 (white) = 36.

To find out how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 (pink) - 6 (white) = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how much change Violetta will get, we first need to determine how many crayons she can buy with $20. Since one crayon costs $2, we can divide the total amount she has ($20) by the cost of one crayon ($2).

20 / 2 = 10

This means Violetta can buy 10 crayons. However, she needs 5 different colors, and it's not specified that she needs 10 crayons of the same color. Assuming she wants 5 different colors, she can buy 2 crayons of each color.

Since she can buy 2 crayons of each color, the total number of crayons she will buy is 5 * 2 = 10.

The cost of 10 crayons is 10 * $2 = $20. Since she has $20 and she spends $20, she will get no change.

The final answer is: $0"
"To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser, since a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. 

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens. 

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total pounds of carrots that will be used by the restaurants. 

Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. 

Total pounds of carrots used = Number of restaurants * Pounds per restaurant
Total pounds of carrots used = 40 * 2
Total pounds of carrots used = 80 pounds

Now, we subtract the total pounds of carrots used from the total pounds of carrots available to find out how many pounds will not be used.

Pounds of carrots not used = Total pounds of carrots - Total pounds of carrots used
Pounds of carrots not used = 200 - 80
Pounds of carrots not used = 120

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokemon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times the number of cards she initially had: 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month: 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months: (60 + 40) * 2 = 200 cards.

To find the total number of cards Elaine has now, we need to add the cards she had initially to the cards she collected in each month: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 cards.

The final answer is: 320"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher is x. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, x is also the number of sentences he edits for Publisher B.

We know that Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, so the total number of sentences for both publishers is 2x = 1000.

To find the number of sentences for each publisher, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 1000 / 2
x = 500

So, Mark edits 500 sentences for each publisher.

We know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, so the total amount Mark earns from Publisher A is:

500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

We also know that Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 2 * 5 cents = 10 cents per sentence. The total amount Mark earns from Publisher B is:

500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we add the amounts from both publishers:

2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

The final answer is: 7500"

Baldur gets 5 pails of water every morning and 6 pails of water every afternoon. So, the total number of pails he gets in a day is 5 + 6 = 11 pails.

Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, the total amount of water he gets every day is 11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters.

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider both the one-time monetary reward and the 5% raise in salary.

First, let's calculate the total amount John earns from his weekly salary for the year. Since he makes $2000 a week and works every week of the year, we multiply his weekly salary by the number of weeks in a year (52).

Weekly salary: $2000
Number of weeks in a year: 52
Total salary for the year: $2000 * 52 = $104,000

Now, let's calculate the 5% raise in salary. A 5% raise means John's new salary will be 105% of his original salary (100% + 5% increase).

Original salary: $2000
New salary: $2000 * 1.05 = $2100

Since John got the award on the first day of the year, he will earn the new salary for all 52 weeks of the year. 

New weekly salary: $2100
Total salary for the year: $2100 * 52 = $109,200

Now, let's add the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to his total salary for the year.

Total earnings for the year: $109,200 + $5000 = $114,200

For sandwiches, Carl ate 7 days' worth of sandwiches (since it's a week) and used 2 slices per sandwich. So, the total slices used for sandwiches = 7 * 2 = 14.

For omelets, Carl ate 3 days' worth of omelets and used one more slice per omelet than per sandwich. So, the total slices used per omelet = 2 + 1 = 3. The total slices used for omelets = 3 * 3 = 9.

For the macaroni and cheese dish, Carl used 8 slices.

Now, let's add the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish together: 14 + 9 + 8 = 31.

"To find out how many pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the total number of pens she initially had and then add the number of pens she bought.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so the total number of pens she had initially is 22 + 10 = 32.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag, so the total number of blue pens she bought is 6 * 9 = 54.

She also bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag, so the total number of red pens she bought is 2 * 6 = 12.

Now, let's add the number of pens she bought to the initial number of pens she had: 32 (initial pens) + 54 (blue pens) + 12 (red pens) = 98.

However, we also need to consider the green and yellow pens she initially had. We already added the pens she bought, but we didn't add the initial green and yellow pens to the total. So, we need to add those as well: 98 + 22 (green pens) + 10 (yellow pens) = 130.

"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to find the total score she needs for the semester. Since there are six tests and she wants an average of 93, we multiply 93 by 6 to get the total score.

Total score needed = 93 * 6
Total score needed = 558

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score from the average, we need to find the lowest score among the five tests she has taken so far. The scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The lowest score is 71.

Now, we add the total score needed and subtract the lowest score to find the total of the remaining five tests.

Total of remaining tests = Total score needed - Lowest score
Total of remaining tests = 558 - 71
Total of remaining tests = 487

Now, we add the scores of the four remaining tests (excluding the lowest score) to find the total of the four tests.

Scores of four tests = 89 + 92 + 100 + 86
Scores of four tests = 367

Now, we subtract the total of the four tests from the total of the remaining tests to find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test.

Score needed on the sixth test = Total of remaining tests - Scores of four tests
Score needed on the sixth test = 487 - 367
Score needed on the sixth test = 120

"To find the total number of kilometers Michael rode his bike, we need to calculate the distance covered in the two different periods.

First, let's calculate the distance covered in the first four weeks when he rode 25 kilometers each time, 5 times a week.

Distance covered in the first four weeks = 25 km * 5 times/week * 4 weeks = 25 * 5 * 4 = 500 km

Next, let's calculate the distance covered in the next three weeks when he rode 60 kilometers each time, 2 times a week.

Distance covered in the next three weeks = 60 km * 2 times/week * 3 weeks = 60 * 2 * 3 = 360 km

Now, let's add the distances covered in both periods to find the total distance.

Total distance = Distance covered in the first four weeks + Distance covered in the next three weeks
Total distance = 500 km + 360 km
Total distance = 860 km

Now, let's add the number of cakes she bought each day: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76.

The final answer is: 76"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total cost of half a dozen plates. 

Half a dozen plates cost 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

Now, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since twenty dozen cups is equal to 20 * 12 = 240 cups, we can find the cost of each cup by dividing the total cost by the number of cups.

Cost of each cup = Total cost of twenty dozen cups / Number of cups
= $34,800 / 240
= $144

The final answer is: $144"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy and the total amount of money she has earned so far. 

The total cost of the items is the cost of the jacket plus the cost of 2 pairs of shoes: 
$30 (jacket) + 2 * $20 (shoes) = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved before she started babysitting. She earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, so the total amount she has earned from babysitting is:
$5 * number of times she babysits.

Let's denote the number of times she babysits as 'x'. Then, the total amount she has earned from babysitting is $5x.

She also earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. Let's denote the number of times she mows the lawn as 'y'. Then, the total amount she has earned from mowing the lawn is $4y.

The total amount of money she has is the sum of the money she already had, the money she earned from babysitting, and the money she earned from mowing the lawn:
$10 (initial savings) + $5x (babysitting) + $4y (mowing the lawn).

Since she wants to buy the jacket and shoes, the total amount of money she has must be greater than or equal to the total cost of the items:
$10 + $5x + $4y ≥ $70.

We want to find the minimum number of times she must mow the lawn, so we want to find the smallest value of 'y' that satisfies the inequality. To do this, we can first subtract $10 from both sides of the inequality:
$5x + $4y ≥ $60.

Since we want to find the minimum value of 'y', we can try to find the smallest value of 'x' that satisfies the inequality. We know that 'x' must be an integer (since it represents the number of times she babysits), so we can try different values of 'x' to find the smallest one that satisfies the inequality.

If x = 4, then $5x = $20, and $20 + $4y ≥ $60. Subtracting $20 from both sides gives $4y ≥ $40. Dividing both sides by $4 gives y ≥ 10.

So, the minimum number of times she must mow the lawn is 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that w = r + 2.

The total number of eggs collected is the sum of the eggs produced by red and white chickens. Since each red chicken produces 3 eggs and each white chicken produces 5 eggs, we can write the equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park since he walks around the edge. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the dimensions of the park, l = 6 miles and w = 1.5 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the perimeter by his speed:

Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as 'x'. We know that the number of customers on the second day is 50 more than the first day, so it can be represented as x + 50.

The total number of customers by the third day is given as 500. Since the number of customers on the second day is x + 50, the number of customers on the third day can be represented as (x + 50) + y, where y is the number of customers on the third day. However, we are given that the total number of customers by the third day is 500, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 50) + y = 500.

However, we are also given that Sloane counts 100 customers entering the store on the first day. So, we can directly use this information to find the number of customers on the second day and then the third day.

The number of customers on the second day is 100 + 50 = 150.

Now, to find the number of customers on the third day, we can subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day: 500 - (100 + 150) = 250.

The final answer is: 250"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, the rate of water loss for both pools is the same. 

The difference in the amount of water between the big and small pool is 2x - x = x gallons. Since the rate of water loss is the same for both pools, the difference in the amount of water between the big and small pool remains constant over time.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as 'y' gallons. Then, the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y gallons.

The difference in the amount of water between the big and small pool is still x gallons. Since the rate of water loss is the same for both pools, the time it takes for the big pool to lose x gallons is the same as the time it takes for the small pool to lose x gallons.

The time it takes for the small pool to lose x gallons is x/4 minutes (since the rate of water loss is 4 gallons/minute). 

The time it takes for the big pool to lose x gallons is also x/4 minutes. Since both pools leak at the same rate, the time it takes for the big pool to lose x gallons is the same as the time it took for the big pool to have twice as much water as the small pool, which is 4 minutes.

Since the time it takes for the big pool to lose x gallons is x/4 minutes, we can set up the equation x/4 = 4. Solving for x, we get x = 16.

Now that we know the initial amount of water in the small pool is 16 gallons, we can find the current amount of water in the small pool. The small pool has been leaking for 4 minutes, so the amount of water lost is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons. 

The current amount of water in the small pool is 16 - 16 = 0 gallons.

The final answer is: 0"
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn, which is the sum of the cost of the shoes and the belt. 

Total cost = Cost of shoes + Cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Since Lori earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total cost by her hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work.

Hours to work = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours to work = $352.00 / $8.00
Hours to work = 44 hours

The final answer is: 44"
"To find the remaining balance, we first need to calculate the total amount Janeth will pay in 12 months. 

Janeth pays $165 per month for 12 months, so the total amount she pays is:
$165 * 12 = $1980

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. The additional amount is 10% of $2000, which is:
$2000 * 0.10 = $200

So, the total amount Janeth needs to pay is $2000 (initial amount) + $200 (additional amount) = $2200

Now, let's subtract the total amount she pays ($1980) from the total amount she needs to pay ($2200):
$2200 - $1980 = $220

Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be $220."
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to determine the number of dahlias and add it to the number of roses. 

First, let's find the number of dahlias. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, and there are 4 roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, let's add the number of roses and dahlias to find the total number of flowers in the vase:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

"To find the average age of the three in three years, we first need to find their current ages and then add 3 to each age. 

Given that Harriet is 21 years old, and she is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is 2 * 21 = 42 years.

Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, Adrian's age is 3 * 21 = 63 years.

Now, we have the current ages of the three: Harriet (21), Zack (42), and Adrian (63). 

In three years, their ages will be: Harriet (21 + 3 = 24), Zack (42 + 3 = 45), and Adrian (63 + 3 = 66).

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3: (24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45.

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points Yuri and Brianna scored. 

Naomi scored 68 points. 
Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. 
Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 
Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points. 

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know that the total points scored by the four students is 251. 
We can subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total to find out how many points Jojo scored. 
Jojo's points = Total points - (Naomi's points + Yuri's points + Brianna's points) 
Jojo's points = 251 - (68 + 44 + 85) 
Jojo's points = 251 - 197 
Jojo's points = 54

"To find out how much water is left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters, we subtract 90 from the initial 120 liters. 

120 - 90 = 30 liters

Since Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left, we multiply the remaining 30 liters by 2.

30 * 2 = 60 liters

The collected rainwater is added to the remaining 30 liters, so we add 60 to 30.

30 + 60 = 90 liters

"To find the total number of flowers Andy planted, we need to calculate the number of petunias first. Since he planted 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, we subtract 40 from the number of geraniums.

Number of geraniums: 90
Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Now, we add the number of geraniums and petunias to find the total number of flowers.

Total flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total flowers = 90 + 50
Total flowers = 140

"To find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we first need to calculate the amount spent in the second year. 

The company spends a third of $15000 in the second year. To find a third of $15000, we divide $15000 by 3.

$15000 / 3 = $5000

Now, we add the amount spent in the first year to the amount spent in the second year to get the total amount spent on advertising for the two years.

$15000 + $5000 = $20000

The total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we first need to calculate the total number of cards James has after losing 8 water type and buying 14 grass type. 

Initially, James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. 

After losing 8 water type cards, he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards.

After buying 14 grass type cards, he has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.

The total number of cards James has now is 30 (fire type) + 34 (grass type) + 32 (water type) = 96 cards.

The percentage chance of picking a water type card is (32 / 96) * 100.

"To find out how much Chad still owes, we need to calculate the total cost of his meal and then subtract the gift card amount.

The base burrito costs $6.50. 
He adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each, which is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50. 
So, the total cost of the add-ons is $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50.
The total cost of the meal before the upgrade is $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00.
He upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, so the new total is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.

"To find the total number of pieces Kalinda and her mom can place per minute, we need to determine how many pieces her mom can place per minute. Since her mom can place half as many pieces as Kalinda, and Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute, her mom can place 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

The total number of pieces they can place per minute is 4 (Kalinda) + 2 (her mom) = 6 pieces per minute.

To find the total time it will take to complete the puzzle, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place per minute. 

360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes

"To find the number of melons not ready to be harvested after two weeks, we need to calculate the number of melons harvested in the two instances and subtract that from the total number of melons.

Initially, there were 120 baby watermelons. 

After two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest. 
30% of 120 is 0.3 * 120 = 36. 
So, 36 watermelons were harvested in the first instance.

The remaining watermelons after the first harvest are 120 - 36 = 84.

After two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready for harvest. 
3/4 of 84 is 0.75 * 84 = 63. 
So, 63 watermelons were harvested in the second instance.

The total number of melons harvested is 36 + 63 = 99.

The number of melons not ready to be harvested after two weeks is 120 - 99 = 21.

"To find out how many vines Steve needs, we first need to determine how many tomatoes he eats per week. Since Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, we multiply this by 7 to get the total tomatoes he eats per week.

6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we can assume his girlfriend eats half as much as Steve. So, his girlfriend eats 6 / 2 = 3 tomatoes per day. 

3 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 21 tomatoes/week

The total number of tomatoes they both eat per week is 42 (Steve) + 21 (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes/week.

Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines they need, we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by the number of tomatoes each vine produces per week.

63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine/week = 21 vines

So, Steve needs 21 vines to produce enough tomatoes for himself and his girlfriend.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Initially, Ram buys 25 pens. 

He uses these 25 pens to make new pens. For each new pen, he uses the ink from 5 empty pens. So, the number of new pens he can make is 25 / 5 = 5.

Now, he has 5 new pens and the 25 original pens. So, the total number of pens he has is 5 + 25 = 30.

However, the 5 new pens he made are also made from the ink of 5 original pens. So, we need to subtract these 5 pens from the total count because they are not new pens but rather the original pens that were used to make the new ones. 

So, the total number of new pens he gets is 25 - 5 = 20.

Therefore, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is 20 (new pens) + 5 (original pens that were not used) + 5 (original pens that were used to make new pens) = 30.

"To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we need to determine the ages of Mary and Joan first.

Since Jessa is 20 years old, and Joan is five years older than Jessa, we can calculate Joan's age as follows:
Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5
Joan's age = 20 + 5
Joan's age = 25

Now, we know that Mary is two years younger than Joan. So, we can calculate Mary's age as follows:
Mary's age = Joan's age - 2
Mary's age = 25 - 2
Mary's age = 23

Now that we have the ages of all three girls, we can find the sum of their ages:

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

We know that John has 54 candies. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can find the number of candies Robert has by dividing John's candies by 2.

Robert's candies = John's candies / 2
Robert's candies = 54 / 2
Robert's candies = 27

We also know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, we can find the number of candies James has by adding 6 to Robert's candies.

James' candies = Robert's candies + 6
James' candies = 27 + 6
James' candies = 33

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. To do this, we subtract James' candies from John's candies.

Difference = John's candies - James' candies

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Dolly has 2 books and Pandora has 1 book. 

Dolly will read her own 2 books and Pandora's 1 book, so Dolly will read a total of 3 books.

Pandora will read her own 1 book and Dolly's 2 books, so Pandora will read a total of 3 books.

In total, they will read 3 (Dolly's total) + 3 (Pandora's total) = 6 books.

However, we need to consider that they also read each other's books. So, Dolly will read Pandora's book and Pandora will read Dolly's book. This means they will read 2 more books.

So, the total number of books they will read is 6 (initial count) + 2 (additional books) = 8 books.

"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he writes and then multiply it by the time it takes him to write one page.

First, let's find out how many letters Mike writes in a week. He has 3 pen pals left, and each of them sends 2 letters a week. So, the total number of letters he receives is 3 * 2 = 6 letters.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages he writes in a week is 6 (letters received) + 6 (letters sent) = 12 letters * 5 pages/letter = 60 pages.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 60 pages * 6 minutes/page = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, 360 minutes / 60 = 6 hours.

Therefore, Mike spends 6 hours writing a week. 

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we first need to calculate the total minutes he used for his daily calls with his boss. 

Since Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day and there are 30 days in the month, the total minutes used for these calls would be:
15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

Additionally, Jason has 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. 

So, the total minutes used would be:
450 minutes (for boss calls) + 300 minutes (extra calls) = 750 minutes

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes available in the plan:
1000 minutes (plan) - 750 minutes (used) = 250 minutes

Therefore, Jason has 250 minutes left in his phone plan.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. So, Griffin was left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Ginger gave Griffin some fries, and then Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. 

After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin was left with 9 - 2 = 7 fries. But we know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, Ginger must have given Griffin 27 - 7 = 20 fries.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2 * 2x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

28 = 4x

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

x = 7

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total amount Jean paid, we need to calculate the total hours worked, the total cost before the discount, and then apply the discount.

First, let's find the total hours worked. The makeup artist works 6 hours a day, 4 times a week, for 5 weeks. 

Total hours worked = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour. 

Total cost before discount = Total hours worked * Hourly rate = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. 

Discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000

Total amount paid by Jean = Total cost before discount - Discount amount = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To find out how much each person paid, we need to first calculate the total cost of the party supplies. 

Total cost = cost of ingredients + cost of presents + cost of decorations + cost of invitations + cost of goodie bags
Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are a total of 3 people sharing the cost. 

Cost per person = Total cost / Number of people
Cost per person = $96 / 3
Cost per person = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"To find out how much the chef spent, we need to calculate the total weight of the onions and then multiply it by the cost per pound.

The chef bought 4 bags of onions, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. So, the total weight of the onions is:

4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

Since a pound of onions costs $1.50, the total cost is:

200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

The chef spent $300."
"To find out how many calories Sue consumed, we first need to determine how many cookies she ate. 

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies, so Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 13 cookies, so Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies.

Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday. Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories and her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

The difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister is 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories.

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the school. 

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60.

Given that the school is 50% girls, the total number of girls in the school is 60 * 0.5 = 30.

We already know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

Now, to find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the total number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls in the school: 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the school is 50% boys, the total number of boys in the school is also 60 * 0.5 = 30.

The total number of boys in the first two classes is 60 - 27 = 33 (since there are 60 students in total and 27 are girls). 

However, we know that each class has 20 students, so the first two classes have 20 + 20 = 40 students. This means that the first two classes have 40 students, not 33. 

Let's recalculate the number of boys in the first two classes. The first class has 20 - 15 = 5 boys. The second class has 20 - 12 = 8 boys. So, the total number of boys in the first two classes is 5 + 8 = 13.

Now, to find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the total number of boys in the first two classes from the total number of boys in the school: 30 - 13 = 17.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. 

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's represent the number of cougars killed today as 'x'. Then, the number of wolves killed today is 3x.

We also know that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, the number of cougars killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since we know the number of cougars killed today is 12, we can set up the equation 3x = 12 to find the number of wolves killed today. Solving for x, we get x = 4. 

However, we already know that the number of cougars killed today is 12, so we don't need to use x. 

Now, we can find the total number of animals killed by adding the number of wolves and cougars killed last night and today. 

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. Today, he killed 12 cougars and 3x wolves. Since we know 3x = 12, we can find the number of wolves killed today by dividing 12 by 3, which is 4. 

So, the total number of wolves killed today is 4. 

Now, let's add the number of wolves and cougars killed last night and today. 
10 (wolves last night) + 15 (cougars last night) + 4 (wolves today) + 12 (cougars today) = 41

The final answer is: 41"
"To find the floor Bill is on, we need to calculate 4 times his starting floor (3) plus 6.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we first need to determine how many times Anne went down the slide. 

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we need to calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30. 

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 

So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. 

To find out how many times Robert went down the slide, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4. 

21 * 4 = 84

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we first need to determine how many cows Mr. Sylas added to each stall. 

Initially, each stall had 20 cows. Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and divided them equally among the 10 stalls. 

So, the number of cows added to each stall is 40 / 10 = 4 cows.

Now, each stall has 20 (initial cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows.

Since we want to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8.

24 * 8 = 192

The final answer is: 192"
"To find the total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the value of the pennies:
100 pennies = 100 x $0.01 = $1.00

Next, let's calculate the value of the nickels:
40 nickels = 40 x $0.05 = $2.00

Now, let's calculate the value of the dimes:
20 dimes = 20 x $0.10 = $2.00

Finally, let's calculate the value of the dollar bills:
40 dollar bills = 40 x $1.00 = $40.00

Now, let's add up the values of all the coins and bills:
$1.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $40.00 = $45.00

The total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank is $45.00.

$45.00"
"To find the total weight of the redwood tree, we first need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections. 

The redwood is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get the total number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so we multiply the number of sections by the weight per section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

Now, we need to find 30% of the total weight that the termites ate. To do this, we multiply the total weight by 0.3 (which is the decimal equivalent of 30%): 8000 * 0.3 = 2400 pounds.

To find the remaining weight after the termites ate 30% of the wood, we subtract the weight eaten by the termites from the total weight: 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds.

"To find the total amount Nancy has to pay, we need to calculate the total cost of the overdue books and add the flat fee.

The cost of the overdue books is $0.50 per book, and she has 8 books. So, the total cost of the overdue books is 8 * $0.50 = $4.00.

In addition to the cost of the overdue books, there's a flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book that's over a week overdue. 

The total amount Nancy has to pay is the sum of the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee: $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples. So, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.
2. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.
3. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.
4. To find the total number of fruits, we need to add the number of apples and bananas that both Andrea and Jamal have. 
   Total fruits = (Andrea's apples + Jamal's apples + Andrea's bananas + Jamal's bananas)
   Total fruits = (52 + 44 + 24 + 48)
   Total fruits = 168

"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we first need to determine how many cups are required for each day. 

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many cups are needed for 36 cookies. 

First, let's find out how many dozens are in 36 cookies: 36 / 12 = 3. So, Carla needs 3 dozen cookies. 

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 1 dozen cookies, Carla will need 3 * 2 = 6 cups of flour for today.

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. Again, we need to find out how many dozens are in 30 cookies: 30 / 12 = 2.5. Since we can't have half a dozen, we need to calculate the flour needed for 2 dozen and half a dozen separately.

For 2 dozen cookies, Carla will need 2 * 2 = 4 cups of flour. For half a dozen cookies, Carla will need 1 cup of flour (since 1 cup is needed for 6 cookies, and half a dozen is 6 cookies). 

So, for tomorrow, Carla will need 4 + 1 = 5 cups of flour.

In total, Carla will need 6 + 5 = 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two-thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to first calculate two-thirds of 9,300 pennies.

Two-thirds of 9,300 is calculated as (2/3) * 9,300 = 6,200.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 pennies by $0.01 to get the total dollar amount.

6,200 * $0.01 = $62.

The final answer is: $62"

"To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, then add them to the selling price.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500.

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

The total price of the house is the sum of the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

To find out how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price: $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

"To find the total time, we first need to determine the time it takes to heat the oil to 400 degrees. 

It takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees. Since it takes 40% longer to heat it up to 400 degrees, we need to find 40% of 20 minutes and add it to 20 minutes.

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. 

So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat the oil to 400 degrees.

After warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. Therefore, the cooking time is 28 - 5 = 23 minutes.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is the sum of the time it takes to warm up the oil and the time it takes to cook. 

Total time = 28 minutes (to warm up the oil) + 23 minutes (to cook) = 51 minutes.

"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we first need to determine the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette. 

The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is a 1800-stitch project, the total number of stitches used for the body and the sleeves is 1800 - 270 = 1530 stitches.

The body takes 900 stitches, so the sleeves take 1530 - 900 = 630 stitches in total.

"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each scene and the song, and then add them up.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has (4/5) * 60 = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to first find the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C, and then subtract that from the total number of cards.

First, we find the number of cards with the letter A: 2/5 of 80 is (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards.

Now, we find the number of cards with the letter B. The remaining cards after A are 80 - 32 = 48. 1/2 of 48 is (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards.

Now, we find the number of cards with the letter C. The remaining cards after A and B are 48 - 24 = 24. 5/8 of 24 is (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards.

Now, we add the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C: 32 + 24 + 15 = 71 cards.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume Sam's current age is 'x'. Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, Ruby's current age is 6x.

In 9 years, Sam's age will be x + 9, and Ruby's age will be 6x + 9.

According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So, we can set up the equation:

6x + 9 = 3(x + 9)

Now, let's simplify the equation:

6x + 9 = 3x + 27

Subtract 3x from both sides:

3x + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:

3x = 18

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 6

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

"To find the total number of spots on the cobras, we need to multiply the number of cobras by the number of spots on each cobra. 

Number of cobras: 40
Spots per cobra: 70
Total spots on cobras: 40 * 70 = 2800

Since the cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can find the number of spots on a mamba by dividing the number of spots on a cobra by 2.

Spots per mamba: 70 / 2 = 35

Now, we can find the total number of spots on the mambas by multiplying the number of mambas by the number of spots on each mamba.

Number of mambas: 60
Spots per mamba: 35
Total spots on mambas: 60 * 35 = 2100

To find the total number of spots on all the snakes, we add the total spots on the cobras and the mambas.

Total spots on all snakes: 2800 + 2100 = 4900

Finally, to find half the number of spots they all have combined, we divide the total number of spots by 2.

Half the total spots: 4900 / 2 = 2450"
"To find out how many pizzas Maddy needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of people she needs to serve. 

There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of people from the team and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. 

Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. 

The total number of people Maddy needs to serve is 15 (team and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, the total number of pizzas needed is 39 / 3 = 13.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total amount Maddy will spend is 13 * 15 = $195.

"To find the total number of stories written in the first week, we need to add the number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot. 

Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week.
Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week.
Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week.

Total stories in the first week = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week. 

Alani doubled her stories from 20 to 20 * 2 = 40.
Braylen doubled his stories from 40 to 40 * 2 = 80.
Margot doubled her stories from 60 to 60 * 2 = 120.

Total stories in the second week = 40 + 80 + 120 = 240

To find the total number of stories written altogether, we need to add the total number of stories written in the first week and the second week.

Total stories = 120 + 240 = 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To find the current age of Ann's brother, we need to multiply Ann's age by 2. 

Ann's age is 9 years, so her brother's current age is 9 * 2 = 18 years.

In 3 years, Ann's brother will be 18 + 3 = 21 years old.

"To find out how many cents Kelly has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has and subtract the cost of the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, which is equivalent to 5 x 25 cents = 125 cents. She also has 2 dimes, which is equivalent to 2 x 10 cents = 20 cents. 

So, the total amount of money Kelly has is 125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents.

Now, let's subtract the cost of the can of pop, which is 55 cents. 

145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the number of rows of 5-star, we first need to find the total number of stars in the flag. 

The flag has three rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 3 * 8 = 24. 

It also has two rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 * 6 = 12. 

The total number of stars in the flag is 76. 

Now, we can find the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows, which is 24 + 12 = 36. 

The number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40. 

Since each 5-star row has 5 stars, the number of rows of 5-star is 40 / 5 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the number of trucks needed, we need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones and then divide that by the weight capacity of each truck.

The weight of one flagstone is 75 pounds, and there are 80 flagstones. 

Total weight of flagstones = 75 pounds/flagstone * 80 flagstones
Total weight of flagstones = 6000 pounds

Now, we need to divide the total weight of the flagstones by the weight capacity of each truck, which is 2000 pounds.

Number of trucks needed = Total weight of flagstones / Weight capacity of each truck
Number of trucks needed = 6000 pounds / 2000 pounds
Number of trucks needed = 3

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the time taken by the car in the slow lane, we first need to determine its speed. Since it's traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, its speed is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. Given that the distance is 480 miles and the speed of the car in the slow lane is 30 miles/hour, we can calculate the time taken as follows:

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

Ali has 22 medals. 
Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

It's given that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have. Let's represent the total number of medals given out as 'x'. So, we have the equation: 39 = x / 10.

To find 'x', we multiply both sides of the equation by 10. This gives us x = 39 * 10 = 390.

The final answer is: 390"
"To find out how many chocolate bars each child will get, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available. 

There are 8 packets of chocolate bars, each containing 5 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Since each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

Now, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children. This is 40 - 24 = 16.

There are 8 children, and they will share the remaining 16 chocolate bars equally. So, each child will get 16 / 8 = 2 chocolate bars.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

First, let's find the total time she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

Total time worked = 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the time to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:

150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval:

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

So, Susan earns $75 for the online task.

The final answer is: $75"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Mike has 21 points after 3 rounds.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

Now, let's calculate the points after the fourth round. In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.

- Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point, making it 21 + 1 = 22 points.
- Jim has 18 points, so he doesn't get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point, making it 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players: 
Mike: 22 points
Jim: 18 points
Tony: 43 points
Total points = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83 points

The final answer is: 83"
"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we first need to determine how many oranges the sons washed. 

The oldest son is 8 years old, and he washes as many oranges as his age, so he washes 8 oranges. 

The youngest son is half as old as the oldest son, so he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. He washes as many oranges as his age, so he washes 4 oranges.

In total, the sons wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Will buys 15 oranges initially, so to find out how many are left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total: 15 - 12 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total count of activities, we need to calculate the number of each activity done on both days and then add them up.

On the first day, Darren does:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

On the second day, he does:
- 20 more pushups than the first day, so 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 10 fewer squats than the first day, so 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- Doubles the number of dumbbell presses, so 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Now, let's add up the total count of each activity:
- Total pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Total squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Total dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

The total count of activities is the sum of these three: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370. 

The final answer is: 370"
"To find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then divide the total amount of rice available by that.

First, let's calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day. Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 3 meals per day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). Since 5 members eat rice every lunch and dinner, we'll assume they also eat it for breakfast. So, the total number of people eating rice per day is 5.

Total rice consumed per person per day = 0.2 kg (lunch) + 0.2 kg (dinner) + 0.2 kg (breakfast) = 0.6 kg
Total rice consumed per day = 5 people * 0.6 kg/person = 3 kg

Now, let's calculate how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last:

Total rice available = 42 kg
Total rice consumed per day = 3 kg

Number of days a 42 kg bag of rice will last = Total rice available / Total rice consumed per day
= 42 kg / 3 kg/day
= 14 days

Since we want to find out how many weeks it will last, we'll divide the number of days by 7 (number of days in a week):

Number of weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last = 14 days / 7 days/week
= 2 weeks

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first need to calculate the total number of crates he sold in the week. 

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he sold bread for 5 days. 

He sold 20 crates over the weekend, which is 2 days. 
He sold 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday.

Total crates sold = 20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) = 65 crates

Since he was closed on Monday and Friday, he had 5 working days. His target for the week is 120 crates. 

To find the target for 5 working days, we need to calculate the daily target: 
Daily target = 120 / 7 = 17.14 (approximately)

Since we can't sell a fraction of a crate, we'll consider the daily target as 17 crates per day for 5 working days. 

Total target for 5 working days = 17 * 5 = 85 crates

Now, let's find the difference between the total target and the total crates sold:
Difference = Total target - Total crates sold = 85 - 65 = 20 crates

Sam was 20 crates off from his target for the week.

"To find the total cost of the desk, we need to determine the last bid made by Carmen. 

The initial bid is $200. The bids rise by $50 each time. Since there are 3 other people who bid once, there are a total of 4 people who bid before Carmen makes her last bid. 

The sequence of bids would be: $200, $250, $300, $350, $400, $450, $500. 

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she makes 4 bids. The last bid is made by Carmen, which is $500. 

The total cost of the desk is the last bid, which is $500.

The final answer is: $500"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to find the total miles driven, the total cost of driving, and the total bonus paid.

First, let's find the total miles driven. Since John goes to work and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 2 * 30 = 60 miles. He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total miles driven per year is 60 * 5 * 50 = 15,000 miles.

The total cost of driving is the total miles driven multiplied by the cost per mile, which is $2. So, the total cost of driving per year is 15,000 * $2 = $30,000.

John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus paid per year is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

The total cost per year is the sum of the total cost of driving and the total bonus paid, which is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The final numerical answer is: $31,800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to add the minutes he exercised on both days. 

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined minutes by 2.

Combined minutes: 39
Twice the combined minutes: 39 * 2 = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

78"
"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process. 

When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two layers: the front and the back. 

For a 32-page tabloid, we need to have 32 pages in total. Since each piece of paper can be folded to create two layers, we can use a single piece of paper to create the front and back of the tabloid. 

However, we need to account for the fact that the first and last pages are on the outside, and the remaining pages are on the inside. 

Since the first and last pages are on the outside, we can use a single piece of paper for each of these pages. 

For the remaining 30 pages, we can use a single piece of paper to create the inside of the tabloid. 

Therefore, we need 2 pieces of paper for the outside pages (first and last) and 1 piece of paper for the inside pages. 

So, the total number of pieces of paper needed is 2 + 1 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to first calculate how much she spent on food and snacks. Since she spent half of her $50 on food and snacks, we can calculate this as:

$50 / 2 = $25

She also spent an additional $10 on rides. So, the total amount she spent is:

$25 (food and snacks) + $10 (rides) = $35

Now, to find out how much she has left, we subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount she had:

$50 (initial amount) - $35 (total spent) = $15

So, Annika has $15 left.

The final answer is: $15"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Total books = 250
- Unsold books = 50
- Books sold this year = 45
- Books sold in the first year = 2 * Books sold this year = 2 * 45 = 90
- Books sold in the second year = Total books - Unsold books - Books sold this year - Books sold in the first year
= 250 - 50 - 45 - 90
= 65

Since each book sells at $20, the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
Total money earned in the second year = Books sold in the second year * Price per book
= 65 * 20
= 1300

The final answer is: $1300"
"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week: 
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Since Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

In a month like April, there are 4 weeks. So, his total earnings from his hourly wage in April are:
$500/week * 4 weeks = $2000

Additionally, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. Since the company performed well for the whole month, he gets a bonus for 4 weeks:
$300/week * 4 weeks = $1200

Now, let's add his earnings from his hourly wage and the bonus to find his total earnings in April:
$2000 + $1200 = $3200

The final answer is: $3200"

"To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we first need to determine how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 

Two-thirds of 60 is calculated as (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves. 

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning. 

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

The total number of loaves produced is 60, and 40 are sold in the morning. 

60 - 40 = 20 loaves are left after the morning sales.

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. 

Half of 20 is calculated as (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are equally divided between the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much weight Joey loses in a single week. 

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight he loses in a week, we divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks: 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks. 

However, the question asks how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds per week, and Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs grown by the person after 15 days.

The person grows an extra arm every 3 days. To find out how many extra arms are grown in 15 days, we divide 15 by 3. 

15 / 3 = 5

So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

The person grows an extra leg every 5 days. To find out how many extra legs are grown in 15 days, we divide 15 by 5.

15 / 5 = 3

So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount spent by Theo on the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket, and then subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount he had, and then subtract the amount he wishes to save.

First, let's calculate the total amount spent on business suits:
6 suits * $100 each = $600

Next, let's calculate the total amount spent on suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50 each = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. 
Cost of a business suit = $100
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
Cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's calculate the total amount spent on business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket:
$600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount he had:
$6000 (initial amount) - $1950 (total spent) = $4050

Finally, let's subtract the amount he wishes to save from the remaining amount:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Noah's current age as N and the population of Chile now as P.

Since Cera is 46 years old now, six years ago, Cera's age was 46 - 6 = 40 years.

We are given that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. So, six years ago, Noah's age was 40 / 2 = 20 years.

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. So, the population of Chile six years ago was 20 * 3000 = 60000.

It is given that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. So, the population of Chile now is 2 * 60000 = 120000.

"Let's break down the information given. 

Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is D/2.

We know that the total number of players on the team is 105. Therefore, the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams is 105.

We can write the equation as: 2D + D + D/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, we multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 4D + 2D + D = 210

Combine like terms: 7D = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7 to solve for D: D = 210 / 7
D = 30

"To find the total number of people invited, we first need to calculate the number of people from the 2 families with 6 people and the 3 families with 4 people.

For the 2 families with 6 people, the total number of people is 2 * 6 = 12.
For the 3 families with 4 people, the total number of people is 3 * 4 = 12.
So, the total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. This means 8 people are subtracted from the total number of people invited, leaving 24 - 8 = 16 people.

Now, 1/4 of the people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments. 1/4 of 8 is 2. So, 2 people had previous commitments and couldn't come to the party.

To find the number of people who show up for Martha's party, we subtract the number of people who had previous commitments from the number of people who were not ill. 16 - 2 = 14.

"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first. 

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. So, his father gave him 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 + 8 = 78.

Each marble weighs 2kgs. To find the total weight of marbles, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble: 78 * 2 = 156.

"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we first need to determine the number of girls and nongendered children.

Given that there are 30 boys, and the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, we can calculate the number of girls by multiplying the number of boys by 3.

Number of girls = 3 * 30 = 90

Next, we are told that the classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys. To find the number of nongendered children, we can multiply the number of boys by 1/10.

Number of nongendered children = 30 * (1/10) = 3

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children.

Total number of children = 30 (boys) + 90 (girls) + 3 (nongendered children) = 123

Given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles:

1 (electric pole) : 3 (electric wires) = x (electric poles) : 45 (electric wires)

We can cross-multiply to solve for x:

1 * 45 = 3x
45 = 3x
x = 45 / 3
x = 15

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of people who left the party. We know that 1/4 of the total number of people left, and 22 men stayed. 

Let's denote the total number of people as 'x'. Since 1/4 of the people left, 3/4 of the people stayed. We can set up the equation:

3/4 * x = 22 + (number of women who stayed)

We know that the total number of people at the beginning was 25 men + 15 women = 40 people. So, x = 40.

Now, we can substitute x = 40 into the equation:

3/4 * 40 = 22 + (number of women who stayed)
30 = 22 + (number of women who stayed)
8 = (number of women who stayed)

Since there were 15 women at the beginning, the number of women who left is 15 - 8 = 7.

The total number of women who left is 7, so the number of women who stayed is 15 - 7 = 8.

Now, we know that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. So, the cost of the pen is $2 - $1 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. We can set up an equation to represent this: 

3x + 2 = 26, where x is the number of pencils in each box.

To find the number of pencils in each box, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: 

3x = 26 - 2
3x = 24

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find the value of x: 

x = 24 / 3
x = 8

So, each box contains 8 pencils. 

Now, let's find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have. Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each, which is 3 * 8 = 24 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils they have is 24 + 46 = 70.

To find the number of boxes needed to store all the pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils in each box: 

Number of boxes = Total number of pencils / Number of pencils in each box
= 70 / 8
= 8.75

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees and then calculate the total weakening effect of the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, so the number of ice cubes needed is 65 / 13 = 5.

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes will make it 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Now, let's consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. Since any added liquid weakens the coffee, the total weakening effect will be the sum of the weakening effect of the ice cubes and the cream. 

Total weakening effect = weakening effect of ice cubes + weakening effect of cream
Total weakening effect = 60 + 15
Total weakening effect = 75 milliliters

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio. For every 2 old records, 1 new record is given. Since 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of new records as 7. 

Now, we need to find out how many old records were traded for these 7 new records. Since the trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record, we can multiply the number of new records by 2 to find the total number of old records traded.

Total old records traded = 7 new records * 2 = 14

However, this is the total number of old records traded by all 5 people. To find out how many old records each person brought in, we need to divide the total number of old records traded by the number of people.

Old records per person = Total old records traded / Number of people
= 14 / 5
= 2.8

Since we can't have a fraction of a record, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can also consider that the 5 people might have traded some records in pairs, and the remaining person might have traded 1 record. 

So, the total number of old records traded by the 4 people who traded 2 records each is 4 * 2 = 8. The remaining 2 old records were traded by the 5th person. 

Therefore, the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people is 8 + 2 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we first need to find the number of junior and senior programmers, and then their respective salaries.

The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 100. 
Number of junior programmers = (2/5) * 100 = 40

Since the number of junior programmers is 40, the number of senior programmers is the remaining 3/5 of the total number of employees.
Number of senior programmers = (3/5) * 100 = 60

The salary of junior programmers is $2000 per month, and senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers.
Salary of senior programmers = $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month

Now, we can find the total amount of money the company pays to all the junior programmers per month.
Total salary of junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers
= 40 * $2000
= $80000

Similarly, we can find the total amount of money the company pays to all the senior programmers per month.
Total salary of senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers
= 60 * $2400
= $144000

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the total salaries of junior and senior programmers.
Total salary of all programmers = Total salary of junior programmers + Total salary of senior programmers
= $80000 + $144000
= $184000

The final answer is: $184000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 'x'.

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus became x + 5.

At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the number of people on the bus became (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2.

Then, 8 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus became (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6.

We are given that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20, so we can set up the equation:

x + 6 = 20

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:

x = 20 - 6
x = 14

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.

He passes 14 out to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.

He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

He eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.

He eats 2 more in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to first find out how many percentage points are left to charge. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more to be fully charged.

Since the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can find the time it takes to charge 40% by multiplying the rate by the amount left to charge: 40% * 3 minutes/percentage-point = 120 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours.

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to first calculate the total number of lollipops she has after her mother gives her 10 more. 

Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her 10 more, so Erin now has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.

Then, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella. To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we subtract 3 from 17. 

17 - 3 = 14

So, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how much the customer paid, we first need to calculate the rewards they earned from their last shopping trip. Since they spent $80 and get $1 off for every $20 spent, we divide $80 by $20 to find out how many rewards they earned. 

$80 / $20 = 4 rewards

Now, we know they used these rewards on this shopping trip. They also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since they used 4 rewards, the coupon took 2 * 4 = 8 dollars off the price.

The customer spent $43 on this shopping trip. The total discount they got is the sum of the rewards and the coupon. 

Total discount = 4 (rewards) + 8 (coupon) = 12 dollars

Now, we subtract the total discount from the amount they spent to find out how much they paid.

Amount paid = $43 - $12 = $31

The customer paid $31 on this shopping trip.

"To determine which job pays more, we need to calculate the net pay for each job.

For Job A, the total income is $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year. The total tax paid is 20% of $30,000, which is 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000. The net pay for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

For Job B, the total income is $42,000. The property tax is $6,000, so the net income before taxes is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. The tax paid is 10% of $36,000, which is 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600. The net pay for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

Since $32,400 is greater than $24,000, Job B pays more. To find the difference in net pay, we subtract the net pay of Job A from the net pay of Job B: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

Total castles = 220
Ruined castles = 220 * 0.4 = 88

Now, we know that half of the ruined castles are unmanned. To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we divide the total number of ruined castles by 2.
Unmanned ruined castles = 88 / 2 = 44

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the price of the shares after the first year and then after the second year.

Initially, Maria buys 8 shares for $8 each, so the total cost is 8 * 8 = $64.

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price, we multiply the original price by 1.5 (100% + 50% increase).
New price after the first year = 8 * 1.5 = $12.

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. To find the new price, we multiply the price after the first year by 0.75 (100% - 25% decrease).
New price after the second year = 12 * 0.75 = $9.

Now, we multiply the new price after the second year by the number of shares to find the final value of Maria's shares.
Final value = 9 * 8 = $72.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the number of students in the two equal groups is x. Since the last group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the last group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 200. Since the two equal groups have x students each, and the last group has x - 10 students, we can set up the following equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

Now that we know the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70, we can find the number of students in the smallest group by subtracting 10:

x - 10 = 70 - 10
= 60

So, the smallest group has 60 students.

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's break down the information given. Farmer Brown has a total of 60 animals, and he has twice as many chickens as cows. 

Let's denote the number of cows as 'c' and the number of chickens as '2c' (since he has twice as many chickens as cows). 

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can write the equation: c + 2c = 60. 

Combining like terms, we get 3c = 60. 

Dividing both sides by 3, we get c = 20. 

So, the number of cows is 20, and the number of chickens is 2c = 2 * 20 = 40.

Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. 

The total number of legs of the chickens is 40 * 2 = 80. 

The total number of legs of the cows is 20 * 4 = 80.

The total number of legs of all the animals is 80 + 80 = 160.

"To find the total time John spent, we need to calculate the time he spent boating, swimming, and watching shows. 

He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. 
So, the total time spent boating and swimming is 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on these activities is 9 + 6 = 15 hours.

We are given that this was 30% of the total time, and he also spent 40% of his time sightseeing. Let's denote the total time as 'T'. 

30% of T is 15, so we can write the equation: 0.3T = 15.

To find T, we divide both sides by 0.3: T = 15 / 0.3 = 50.

Now that we have the total time, we can find the time spent sightseeing, which is 40% of T. 

Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * T = 0.4 * 50 = 20 hours.

So, the remaining cost for go-karts and arcade tokens for her friends is $50 - $5 = $45.

The cost of go-karts for her friends is $20, and the cost of arcade tokens for her friends is $10. 
So, the remaining cost for go-karts for her friends is $45 - $10 = $35.

The cost of go-karts for her friends is $20, and the remaining cost for go-karts is $35. 
So, the number of go-kart rides for her friends is $35 / $20 = 1.75.

Since Morgan and her friends can't ride a fraction of a go-kart, we'll round down to 1.75 to 1.

However, we know that Morgan and her friends will ride the go-karts twice, so the number of go-kart rides for her friends is 2.

"To find out how much money Marisa saves in her piggy bank, we first need to calculate how much she spends on lollipops each day. 

She buys 4 lollipops at 25 cents each, so the total cost of lollipops per day is 4 * 0.25 = $1.

Since she gets $5 as pocket money, the change she saves each day is 5 - 1 = $4.

If she saves for 5 days, the total amount she saves is 4 * 5 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much change Billy had after buying the candy. 

Billy had $10 and spent $1.5 per pound on candy. Let's call the number of pounds of candy he bought 'x'. The total cost of the candy is 1.5x. 

So, the change he had is 10 - 1.5x.

He then took half of this change and spent it on gumballs. Since each gumball costs $0.05, the total cost of the gumballs is 0.05 * 40 = $2.

Since he took half of his change, the amount he spent on gumballs is half of the change, which is (10 - 1.5x) / 2.

We know that this amount is equal to $2, so we can set up the equation:

(10 - 1.5x) / 2 = 2

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

10 - 1.5x = 4

Now, we can isolate x by subtracting 10 from both sides:

-1.5x = -6

Dividing both sides by -1.5 gives us:

x = 4

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break down the information given. Carver's age is 45, and it's 5 years less than twice the age of his son. 

Let's represent the son's age as 'x'. According to the information, 2x - 5 = 45. 

To find the son's age, we need to solve for 'x'. 

First, add 5 to both sides of the equation: 2x = 45 + 5
2x = 50

Next, divide both sides by 2: x = 50 / 2
x = 25

The son is 25 years old.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to add the distances between the three cities. 

Distance from the first city to the second city = 75 miles
Distance from the second city to the third city = 100 miles
Distance from the third city to the first city = 100 - 50 = 50 miles (since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs)
Total distance in one trip = 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is:
Total daily distance = 225 miles * 3 = 675 miles

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we need to divide the total distance it travels before service by the daily distance:
Days between services = 18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.67 days

So, the train goes approximately 26.67 days between services."
"To find the amount of stuffing needed for the collie beds, we first need to find the average amount of stuffing between the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds. 

The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we need to find the total amount of stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds. 

For the chihuahua beds: 4 beds * 2 pounds per bed = 8 pounds.
For the collie beds: 3 beds * 5 pounds per bed = 15 pounds.

The total amount of stuffing needed is 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

"To find the total time taken for the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the trip and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time taken for the trip to his friend's house. The distance is 200 miles and the speed is 70 mph. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 miles / 70 mph
Time = 2.857 hours (approximately)

However, he took a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. So, the actual distance traveled to his friend's house is 200 + 10 = 210 miles. 

Time taken for the detour part = 10 miles / 70 mph
Time taken for the detour part = 0.143 hours (approximately)

Total time taken to reach his friend's house = 2.857 hours + 0.143 hours
Total time taken to reach his friend's house = 3 hours

Now, let's calculate the time taken for the trip back home. The distance is 240 miles and the speed is 80 mph.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 240 miles / 80 mph
Time = 3 hours

Total time taken for the trip = Time taken to reach his friend's house + Time taken for the trip back home
Total time taken for the trip = 3 hours + 3 hours
Total time taken for the trip = 6 hours

Number of boys = 2 * 6
Number of boys = 12

Now, to find the total number of kids in the park, we add the number of girls and the number of boys.

1. 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 
   Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting as S. 
   We can write the equation as S = 4 * 3 - 5
   S = 12 - 5
   S = 7
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 
   Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as V. 
   We can write the equation as V = 3 * S
   V = 3 * 7
   V = 21
4. If a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, we can write the equation as:
   Total = 3 (refusing to wear masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) + X (other reasons)
   50 = 3 + 7 + 21 + X
   50 = 31 + X

Erin's current points = 3 * 8 + 8
Erin's current points = 24 + 8
Erin's current points = 32

"To find the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. There are 44 seniors, and each picture frame costs $20. So, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of etching the logo on each picture frame. The etching costs an additional 20% of the cost of the picture frame, which is 20% of $20 = $4. So, the total cost of etching is 44 * $4 = $176.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the pins. 2 seniors will receive pins, and each pin costs $5. So, the total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the cords. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 officers. Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12. So, the total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, let's add up the costs of the picture frames, etching, pins, and cords to find the total cost of the senior gifts.

$880 (picture frames) + $176 (etching) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1198

Savings = 20% of $400 = 0.20 * $400 = $80
Materials cost = Market price - Savings = $400 - $80 = $320

So, the total cost of making the hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs on Sunday, so we need to subtract those from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday. 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add up the total number of shoes sold: 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, we multiply the total number of pairs by 2 to get the total number of shoes sold: 50 * 2 = 100.

"To find out how much milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from the half of the sheep that gives 1 kg of milk and the half that gives 2 kg of milk.

First, let's find out how many sheep are in each half. Since Mary has 30 sheep, half of them would be 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

The first half gives 1 kg of milk each, so the total milk from this half would be 15 * 1 = 15 kg.

The second half gives 2 kg of milk each, so the total milk from this half would be 15 * 2 = 30 kg.

Now, let's add the milk from both halves to find the total milk collected every day: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find out how many pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we first need to determine how many rolls were left after feeding her children. 

She started with a dozen rolls, which is 12 rolls. After feeding her 6 children, she had 12 - 6 = 6 rolls left. 

Since she broke each of the remaining rolls into 8 pieces, we multiply the number of rolls left by 8. So, 6 rolls * 8 pieces per roll = 48 pieces.

Therefore, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the number of pupils who like the color yellow, we first need to find the number of pupils who like blue and green.

Half of the class likes blue, so the number of pupils who like blue is 40 / 2 = 20.

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. The remaining pupils are 40 - 20 = 20. One-fourth of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5.

Now, we need to find the number of pupils who like yellow. The number of pupils who like yellow is the remaining pupils after subtracting the number of pupils who like blue and green. So, the number of pupils who like yellow is 40 - 20 - 5 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we need to calculate the number of apples picked each day and then add them together.

On Monday, we don't know the number of apples picked, but we know she sold them all for $56 at $4 per apple. So, the number of apples picked on Monday is 56 / 4 = 14.

On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, let's add the number of apples picked each day: 14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many socks Lindsay has washed, we need to calculate the total number of socks from the pairs and the loose socks. 

Since each pair consists of 2 socks, washing 10 pairs means Lindsay has washed 10 * 2 = 20 socks from the pairs. 

Adding the 15 loose socks, Lindsay has washed a total of 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks in total, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is 50 - 35 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many cookies are left for Rachel, we need to add the number of cookies she initially bought to the number of cookies Janet gave her, and then subtract the number of cookies her brother ate.

First, let's add the number of cookies Rachel bought to the number of cookies Janet gave her: 
23 (initial cookies) + 42 (cookies from Janet) = 65 cookies

Now, let's subtract the number of cookies her brother ate from the total:
65 (total cookies) - 44 (cookies eaten) = 21 cookies

So, there are 21 cookies left for Rachel.

"To find the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total interest paid over the five months and then divide it by the number of months. 

First, let's find the total interest paid over five months. The formula for simple interest is: 

Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Here, Principal = $3,650, Rate = 10% or 0.10, and Time = 5 months.

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Interest = $1,825

Now, we need to add the interest to the principal to find the total amount Karan needs to pay back. 

Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $3,650 + $1,825
Total Amount = $5,475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by the number of months.

Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Number of Months
Monthly Payment = $5,475 / 5
Monthly Payment = $1,095

The final answer is: $1,095"
"To find out how far each person hiked, we need to multiply their speed by the time they hiked.

Cho hiked at 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours, so the distance Cho hiked is 14 * 8 = 112 kilometers.

Chloe hiked at 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours, so the distance Chloe hiked is 9 * 5 = 45 kilometers.

To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked than Chloe, we need to subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked: 112 - 45 = 67 kilometers.

The final answer is: 67"
"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we first need to determine how many silver and gold pesos each of them has.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. 

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. 
Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's add up the total number of silver and gold pesos each of them has:
Axel's total: 50 (silver) + 80 (gold) = 130 pesos
Anna's total: 100 (silver) + 120 (gold) = 220 pesos

The total number of pesos they have together is the sum of their individual totals: 130 + 220 = 350 pesos.

The final answer is: 350"
"To find the total profit per hour, we first need to determine the total revenue and the total cost.

Millie buys supplies for $18 to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups, so she can make 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade. 

She sells each cup of lemonade for $1, so her total revenue will be 36 * $1 = $36.

Her total cost is $18.

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue: $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, we need to find out how many hours it takes her to sell all the lemonade. Since she has 36 cups, and she sells 4 cups per hour, it will take her 36 / 4 = 9 hours to sell all the lemonade.

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours: $18 / 9 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we can use the information that he sold 3/5 of his land and had 12.8 hectares left. 

Let's assume the initial amount of land is x hectares. Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 of his land left. We can set up the equation:

2/5 * x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land initially.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the number of female members in the choir, we first need to calculate 50% of the total members. 

50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26

So, there are 26 female members in the choir.

Since half the people performing can't make it to the show, we need to find half of the female members.

Half of 26 = 26 / 2 = 13

Now, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is the sum of the remaining female members and the teachers.

Total people who sang = 13 + 3 = 16

Now, let's add the cost of erasers and pencils together: $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu.

First, let's find out how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

The final answer is: 88"
"To find out how much money David saves, we first need to calculate the cost of the rides for Dasha and compare it to the cost of the ride bracelet for David.

Each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, so the cost of one ride is 2 * $2 = $4.

Since they ride all 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha to buy tickets for all rides is 9 * $4 = $36.

David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides. 

The cost for Dasha to ride all 9 rides is $36, and the cost for David to ride all 9 rides is $30. 

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract the cost for David from the cost for Dasha: $36 - $30 = $6.

"To find out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we first need to determine the total number of gifts she has to wrap. 

Total gifts = gifts for family + gifts for friends + gifts for teachers
Total gifts = 6 + 4 + 2
Total gifts = 12

Since Monica wants to make a bow for each gift, she will need to make 12 bows in total. 

Now, we need to find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each bow. To do this, we divide the total amount of ribbon by the total number of bows.

Total ribbon = 144 inches
Total bows = 12

Ribbon per bow = Total ribbon / Total bows
Ribbon per bow = 144 / 12
Ribbon per bow = 12

"To find the number of popsicles each person has, we need to first find the total parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 6 = 11. 

We can then divide the total number of popsicles (165) by the total parts in the ratio (11) to find the value of one part. 

165 / 11 = 15

Now, we can multiply the value of one part by the number of parts each person has in the ratio. 

Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 x 15 = 75 popsicles.
Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 x 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has.

90 - 75 = 15

"To find out how much Tim saves by canceling his cable package, we need to compare the cost of the streaming services to the cost of the cable package. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the bundled streaming services. The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus individually is $10 each, but Tim gets a 20% discount for bundling. 

20% of $10 is 0.2 * $10 = $2. 
So, the discount is $2. 
The cost of the bundled services is $10 + $10 - $2 = $18. 

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the cable package, which is $60. 

The savings is $60 - $18 = $42.

"To find the total number of books Wendy wants to place, we first need to determine the number of books in the shelving system and then add 20 more to double that amount.

The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so the total number of books it can hold is 6 * 6 = 36.

Now, Wendy wants to double this amount and add 20 more. First, we double the number of books: 36 * 2 = 72.

Then, we add 20 more to this amount: 72 + 20 = 92.

So, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

The final answer is: 92"
"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica has now, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, added to the cards her dad brought, and then subtract the cards she passed out and add the cards she received.

Initially, Erica had 20 Valentine's cards. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards that had 15 cards each, so she got 2 * 15 = 30 cards from her dad. 

Now, Erica has 20 (initial cards) + 30 (cards from dad) = 50 cards.

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so she gave away a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

She received 17 cards from family and friends.

So, the total number of cards Erica has now is 50 (cards she had) - 29 (cards she gave away) + 17 (cards she received) = 38.

"To find out how many slices are left, we first need to determine how many slices Jenny gave away. 

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, we can calculate the number of slices Bill got by multiplying 12 by 1/3. 

12 * (1/3) = 12 * 1 / 3 = 12 / 3 = 4 slices

Jenny gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. We can calculate the number of slices Mark got by multiplying 12 by 1/4.

12 * (1/4) = 12 * 1 / 4 = 12 / 4 = 3 slices

In total, Jenny gave away 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny ate 2 slices, so the total number of slices she gave away or ate is 7 + 2 = 9 slices.

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total number of slices given away or eaten from the total number of slices in the pizza.

12 - 9 = 3 slices

"To find the total number of bugs, we first need to find the number of millipedes and stink bugs. 

Nancy saw 90 spiders. The number of millipedes is 1/3rd of the number of spiders, so the number of millipedes is 90 / 3 = 30.

The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12, so the number of stink bugs is (2 * 30) - 12 = 48.

Now, we add up the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs to find the total number of bugs: 90 + 30 + 48 = 168.

"To find out how much the builder earns in a year, we first need to calculate his daily earnings and then multiply it by the total number of working days in a year.

The builder works 6 days a week and 4 weeks a month. So, his monthly working days are 6 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 24 days/month.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of working days in a year is 24 days/month * 12 months/year = 288 days/year.

The builder gets paid $50 every day. So, his daily earnings are $50/day.

Now, we can calculate his yearly earnings by multiplying his daily earnings by the total number of working days in a year: $50/day * 288 days/year = $14400/year.

"To find out how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for the quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, we multiply the ingredients by 4.

For flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
For milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark will need to buy:
12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark will need to buy:
4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4

"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the energy used by the air conditioner in a day. 

The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour. Since there are 8 hours of usage, the total energy used in a day is:
900 watts/hour * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours or 7.2 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day.

If Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours, the new usage time is:
8 hours - 5 hours = 3 hours per day.

The new energy used in a day is:
900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours or 2.7 kWh per day.

The energy saved per day is the difference between the original and new usage:
7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh per day.

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily energy saved by 30:
4.5 kWh/day * 30 days = 135 kWh.

"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we first need to calculate the total number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves:

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we need a total of 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so the total cost of the meat is:
5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so the total cost of the cheese is:
5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is the sum of the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese:
$35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

"To solve this problem, we first need to find the initial number of corns and cannolis Allan had at home. 

Since Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis and he has 40 cannolis, the initial number of corns is 2 * 40 = 80.

Allan bought 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. So, he bought 60 cannolis and 60 - 40 = 20 corns.

Now, we add the initial and the additional items to find the total number of each item. The total number of cannolis is 40 (initial) + 60 (additional) = 100. The total number of corns is 80 (initial) + 20 (additional) = 100.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 (cannolis) + 100 (corns) = 200.

"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first calculate the total steps he completed before the jog. 

Elliott finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since he wants to walk 10,000 steps, half of that would be 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. 

He also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, the total steps completed before the jog would be 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Since he had 2,000 steps left to take after the jog, we can find the total steps taken during the jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the total steps he wanted to take. 

Total steps taken during the jog = Total steps wanted - Remaining steps
Total steps taken during the jog = 10,000 - 2,000
Total steps taken during the jog = 8,000

So, Elliott took 8,000 steps during his jog.

"To find out how many minutes Toby will be early, we need to calculate the total time it takes for him to read the book and travel to the airport.

First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book: 
45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words

Since Toby can read 300 words per minute, we can calculate the time it takes for him to read the book:
9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

Now, we add the time it takes to get to the airport:
30 minutes (reading time) + 10 minutes (travel time) = 40 minutes

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to leave for the airport, so we subtract the total time from the available time:
60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

Toby will be 20 minutes early."
"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately and then add them together.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked for 40 hours a week and was paid $15 per hour. So, the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 hours/week * 4 weeks = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 hours * $15/hour = $2400. Since there are 40 employees, the total amount paid in May is 40 employees * $2400/employee = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 * 40 employees = 10 employees left. These 10 employees worked for 40 hours a week * 4 weeks = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 hours * $15/hour = $2400. Since there are 10 employees left, the total amount paid in June is 10 employees * $2400/employee = $24,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $24,000 = $120,000.

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds and the sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off,"" we can consider it as a 2-pound purchase with a discount on the second pound. The first pound costs $3, and the second pound is half off, which is $3 * 0.5 = $1.5. So, the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.5 = $4.5.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. She bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $4.5 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

"To find the total amount spent by Tim, we first need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks and the finale firework.

The first package of fireworks costs $400. The second package costs twice that much, so it's 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packages. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 20% (or 0.20). The discount is $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

The discounted cost of the two packages is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Adding the cost of the finale firework, the total amount spent by Tim is $960 + $150 = $1110.

"To find out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we first need to determine how many cookies she eats in 30 days. 

Since she eats 2 cookies a night, we multiply the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of nights in 30 days. There are 30 nights in 30 days. 

2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since Shannon wants to have enough cookies for 30 days, we need to find out how many dozens of cookies she needs to make to have 60 cookies. 

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies needed (60) by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs.

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen cookies

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. 

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the candles have this defect, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of candles that smell like wet dog = Total number of candles * Percentage of candles with the defect
= 50000 * 0.05
= 2500

Now, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. Since Marcy guarantees that 99% of the candles will not explode, the percentage of candles that will explode is 1% (100% - 99%). However, this 1% is out of the total number of candles, not the number of candles that smell like wet dog. 

To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find 1% of the number of candles that smell like wet dog:

Number of candles that smell like wet dog and explode = Number of candles that smell like wet dog * Percentage of candles that will explode
= 2500 * 0.01
= 25

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to find the price of each blouse after the 30% discount. 

The discount amount is 30% of the regular price, which is 0.3 * $20 = $6. 

So, the discounted price of each blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is 4 * $14 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.
- The combined total of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is 30 + 60 + 15 + 45 = 150 apples.
- Since the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - 150 = 350 apples.
- Since Joanne gathers some apples from the average trees, we need to find out how many apples she gathered from the average trees. Let's denote the number of apples she gathered from the average trees as 'x'.
- The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 30 (from the tallest trees) + 15 (from the shortest trees) + x (from the average trees) = 45 + x.
- The total number of apples gathered by her sister is 60 (from the tallest trees) + 45 (from the shortest trees) = 105 apples.
- The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so 45 + x + 105 = 500.
- Solving for x, we get x = 500 - 150 = 350.

However, this is the total number of apples gathered from the average trees by both sisters. Since the problem asks for the number of apples gathered by Joanne from the average trees, we need to find out how many apples she gathered from the average trees. Let's denote the number of apples she gathered from the average trees as 'y'. We know that the number of apples gathered from the average trees by both sisters is 350, so y + (number of apples gathered by her sister from the average trees) = 350. Since her sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees, the number of apples gathered by her sister from the average trees is 0. So, y + 0 = 350, which means y = 350.

The final answer is: 350"
"Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. We know that camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each. 

We are given two pieces of information: 
1. The total number of heads is 180, which means C + D = 180.
2. The total number of bumps is 304, which means 2C + D = 304.

We can solve this system of equations to find the number of dromedaries. 

First, let's subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate D:
2C + D - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of dromedaries:
C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down the information given.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is 4 * 200 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers. So, the total distance covered in the next two days is 240 kilometers.

On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance covered is 0 kilometers.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance covered in the second week is 7 * 300 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, let's add up the distances covered in each period: 
- First 4 days: 800 kilometers
- Next 2 days: 240 kilometers
- Next 1 day: 0 kilometers
- Second week: 2100 kilometers

Total distance = 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

The final answer is: 3140"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work backwards from Peter's locker size. 

Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can find Zack's locker size by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4. 

Zack's locker size = 5 * 4 = 20 cubic inches.

Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can find Timothy's locker size by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size = 20 * 2 = 40 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the elevation where Stanley's comb fell, we need to subtract the distance it fell from Stanley's initial elevation. 

Stanley's initial elevation: 10,000 feet
Distance the comb fell: 4,000 feet
Elevation where the comb fell: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation where the comb fell and Oliver's elevation to determine how much Oliver needs to climb.

Elevation where the comb fell: 6,000 feet
Oliver's elevation: 3,000 feet
Distance Oliver must climb: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know that the first bank gave Mr. Josue $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much, so the second bank gave him 2 * $4000 = $8000.

Now, let's add the money he received from both banks: $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital. To find the total capital he has now, we need to add the money he received from the banks to his initial capital: $5000 + $12000 = $16000.

The final answer is: $16000"
"To find the number of cats left on the rock, we first need to determine the number of cats taken away by the boats and then subtract that from the initial number of cats. 

Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats taken away by the boats is 4 * 5 = 20.

Now, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30.

After the boats left, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find the number of cats that ran after the mouse, we multiply the remaining cats by 3/5: 30 * (3/5) = 18.

Now, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12.

So, the number of cats left on the rock is 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different periods and calculate the cost for each period.

1. The first 6 months were $8 a month, so the cost for this period is 6 * $8 = $48.
2. The next 8 months were $12 a month, so the cost for this period is 8 * $12 = $96.
3. After that, the price increased to $14 a month. Since 2 years is 24 months, and we've already accounted for 14 months, there are 24 - 14 = 10 months left. The cost for this period is 10 * $14 = $140.

Now, let's add up the costs for each period: $48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284.

The final answer is: $284"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let the cost of the jogger jeans be x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the cost of the tattered jeans is x + $6.

The total savings is $6, and Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. This means he saved 1/3 * $6 = $2 from the jogger jeans and the rest, which is $6 - $2 = $4, from the tattered jeans.

Since he saved $4 from the tattered jeans, the cost of the tattered jeans is $28 - $4 = $24.

Now we know the cost of the tattered jeans is $24 and the jogger jeans is x. We also know that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so x = $24 - $6 = $18.

The difference in cost between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $24 - $18 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then add them together.

The capacity of the 4 buses is 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
The capacity of the 6 minibusses is 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
The capacity of the 10 minivans is 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, we add the capacities together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many birds each type of feeder attracts and then add them up.

Lillian made 3 bird feeders, and each of them attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds. So, the homemade feeders attract 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

She bought 3 bird feeders, and each of them attracts 20 birds. So, the store-bought feeders attract 3 * 20 = 60 birds.

In total, Lillian can expect to see 90 + 60 = 150 birds in her garden each day.

"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The bagel costs $4. 
The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, which is 4 + (4 * 0.25) = 4 + 1 = $5.
The cake costs half the price of the bagel, which is 4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: 
4 (bagel) + 5 (soup) + 2 (cake) = 11.

The total cost of Aleksandra's dinner is $11.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cards Kenny sold to get the remaining $50. Since he sold the cards for $1.5 each, we can divide the remaining money by the price per card to find the number of cards sold.

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as 'x'. Since he kept 1/3 of the cards, he sold 2/3 of the cards. The number of cards sold is (2/3)x.

The money he got from selling the cards is equal to the number of cards sold multiplied by the price per card, which is $1.5. So, the equation becomes:

(2/3)x * 1.5 = 50

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2 to get:

x = 50 * (3/2)
x = 75

So, Kenny started with 75 cards.

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, the caterer prepared enough hot dogs for half of the guests to have two hot dogs. Since there are 36 guests, half of them would be 36 / 2 = 18 guests. 

For these 18 guests, the caterer prepared 2 hot dogs each, so the total number of hot dogs prepared for these 18 guests is 18 * 2 = 36 hot dogs.

However, the caterer prepared enough hot dogs for these 18 guests to have two hot dogs each, but the total number of guests who showed up is 40. This means that 40 - 36 = 4 extra guests showed up.

Since everyone wanted a second hot dog, the caterer had to give out 40 hot dogs in total. The 36 hot dogs were already prepared for the 18 guests who were supposed to have two hot dogs each. This means that the remaining 4 hot dogs were given to the 4 extra guests who showed up.

Now, we need to find out how many guests did not get a second hot dog. Since the 4 extra guests got a second hot dog, they were the ones who got an extra hot dog. The 36 guests who were originally supposed to have two hot dogs each already got their second hot dog, so they are not the ones who did not get a second hot dog.

The 4 extra guests who showed up were the ones who got the extra hot dogs, but they were not part of the original 36 guests who were supposed to have two hot dogs each. This means that the 4 extra guests are the ones who got a second hot dog, and the 36 - 4 = 32 guests who were originally supposed to have one hot dog each did not get a second hot dog.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we first need to find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Indras has 6 letters in her name. Half of 6 is 3. 

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

The total number of letters in both names is 6 (Indras) + 7 (her sister) = 13.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount and then apply the 20% discount.

The total cost of the items before the discount is:
- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- 5 separate utensils: 5 * $5.00 = $25.00
Total cost before discount: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Now, we need to apply the 20% discount to the total cost. To do this, we multiply the total cost by 0.20 (which is the decimal equivalent of 20%).
Discount: $165.00 * 0.20 = $33.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final amount Charlotte needs to pay.
Final amount: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

The final answer is: $132.00"
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and subtract the amount of money she already has.

The total cost of the items is: $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19.

Dora has a total of $2 (her allowance) + $16 (from her mother) = $18.

To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 (total cost) - $18 (amount she has) = $1.

So, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

"To find out how many dragons Prince Bruce has slain, we need to first determine how many dragons Prince Arthur and Prince Walter have slain.

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, who slew 100 dragons. Three quarters of 100 is 75. So, Prince Arthur slew 75 dragons.

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, who slew 75 dragons. Twice of 75 is 150. So, Prince Walter slew 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, who slew 150 dragons. One-fifth of 150 is 30. So, Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons.

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to determine how much gas was in one container. Since 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 gallons by 5.

15 gallons / 5 = 3 gallons per container

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we multiply the number of gallons per container by 8 to find the number of pints per container.

3 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 24 pints per container

Josey needed 1/4 of a container to run her lawnmower, so we multiply the number of pints per container by 1/4.

24 pints/container * 1/4 = 6 pints

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George had initially. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can set up an equation to find the initial amount.

Let's denote the initial amount as 'x'. Since 1% of 'x' is $5, we can write the equation as:

0.01x = 5

To find 'x', we can divide both sides by 0.01:

x = 5 / 0.01
x = 500

So, George initially had $500.

Now, let's find out how much he spent on chips. He bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so the total cost of chips is:

3 * 0.40 = $1.20

Since he spent $5 in total, the amount he spent on candy bars is:

5 - 1.20 = $3.80

Now, we know that each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars he bought is:

3.80 / 0.75 = 5.07

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can buy 5 candy bars with $3.50 and have $0.30 left, which is not enough to buy another candy bar. Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to first determine how many lollipops he shared with his friends. 

Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself, so he shared 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops with his friends.

Since he shared the lollipops equally among his four friends, we need to divide the total number of lollipops shared (20) by the number of friends (4).

20 lollipops / 4 friends = 5 lollipops per friend.

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the remaining weight of the cake, we first need to determine how much of the cake was eaten. Since Rory and her mom each had a piece, that's 2 pieces in total. 

The cake was cut into 8 pieces, and 2 pieces were eaten. To find the weight of the eaten pieces, we need to find the weight of one piece and multiply it by 2. 

The total weight of the cake is 20 ounces, and it was cut into 8 pieces. To find the weight of one piece, we divide the total weight by the number of pieces: 20 ounces / 8 pieces = 2.5 ounces per piece.

Since 2 pieces were eaten, we multiply the weight of one piece by 2: 2.5 ounces * 2 = 5 ounces.

Now, we subtract the weight of the eaten pieces from the total weight to find the remaining weight: 20 ounces - 5 ounces = 15 ounces.

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"To find out how many oranges each person will get, we first need to calculate the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have. 

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. 

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56

Since they are sharing the oranges with 6 other friends, including themselves, the total number of people sharing the oranges is 8 (Sitti, Juris, and 6 friends).

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people.

Oranges per person = Total oranges / Total people
= 56 / 8

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Bernadette to get to the theater and then determine how much earlier she needs to leave than Wayne.

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, Bernadette's drive will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, she needs to leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne.

However, we are asked how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, not how long before she arrives. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to leave 21 - 4 = 17 minutes earlier than Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. Since the area of the room is given as 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. 

1 yard = 3 feet, so 3 yards = 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length * Width. 

360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the width, we can find the perimeter of the room using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The final answer is: 98"
"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister has.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, let's find the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters:
Difference = Total beads Margareth has - Total beads Elizabeth has
= 140 - 60

"To find the final temperature of the house, we need to calculate the temperature increase due to the oven and the temperature decrease due to the open window.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour, and Marcus bakes for 3 hours. So, the total temperature increase due to the oven is 5 * 3 = 15 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the open window. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open, and the window is open for 30 minutes. So, the total temperature decrease due to the open window is (2 * 3) = 6 degrees, because 30 minutes is 3 sets of 10 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the final temperature of the house. The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. The temperature increase due to the oven is 15 degrees, and the temperature decrease due to the open window is 6 degrees. So, the final temperature of the house is 40 + 15 - 6 = 49 degrees.

The final answer is: 49"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took James to complete each segment of the triathlon. 

Let's start with the swim. Since James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, we need to find 10% of Jon's swim time and subtract it from Jon's swim time. 

10% of 40 minutes is 0.1 x 40 = 4 minutes. So, James' swim time is 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

Next, we know that James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. Jon's bike time is 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes. So, James' bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, we know that Jon won by 10 minutes. This means that the difference between James' total time and Jon's total time is 10 minutes. We can set up an equation to represent this:

Jon's total time - James' total time = 10 minutes

We know Jon's total time is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes. We also know James' swim time (36 minutes) and bike time (85 minutes). Let's call James' run time 'x'. Then, James' total time is 36 + 85 + x.

Now, we can set up the equation:

170 - (36 + 85 + x) = 10

Simplifying the equation, we get:

170 - 121 - x = 10
49 - x = 10
x = 39

So, it took James 39 minutes to complete the run. 

The final answer is: 39"

"To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

First, let's find out how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes. Since the horse runs at 32MPH, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

30 minutes is equal to 0.5 hours (since 1 hour = 60 minutes).

Now, we can calculate the distance covered by the horse:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32MPH * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, the total hay consumed is:

Total Hay = Distance * (1/2 bail/mile)
Total Hay = 16 miles * (1/2 bail/mile)
Total Hay = 8 bails

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of the hay is:

Total Cost = Total Hay * Cost per bail
Total Cost = 8 bails * $3/bail
Total Cost = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:

Total Money = 6 * $5
Total Money = $30

Now, we can find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay:

Change = Total Money - Total Cost
Change = $30 - $24
Change = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many trays Rozanne can put out, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs she has. 

Rozanne uses 4 dozen eggs from cases. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs would be 4 * 12 = 48 eggs.

She also uses 2 loose eggs from the cupboard. 

So, the total number of eggs is 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs, so the total number of glasses she can make is 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, so the total number of trays she can put out is 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

"To find out how many points Joey is winning by, we need to calculate the difference between his score and Marcy's score after their turns.

Initially, Joey has 214 points and scores 26 points, so his new score is 214 + 26 = 240 points.

Marcy has 225 points and scores 10 points, so her new score is 225 + 10 = 235 points.

Now, we subtract Marcy's score from Joey's score to find the difference: 240 - 235 = 5.

So, Joey is winning by 5 points.

"To find the salesman's profit, we first need to calculate the total revenue from the flash sale and the department store sales.

The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each at the flash sale, so the total revenue from the flash sale is:
17 * $20 = $340

The salesman sold the remaining 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers to the department store for $25 each. The total revenue from the department store sales is:
31 * $25 = $775

The total revenue from both sales is:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The cost of the case of 48 sneakers is $576. To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the total revenue:
$1115 - $576 = $539

The salesman's profit is $539.

"To find the total number of crayons Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the total number of crayons in the six packets with 8 pieces each and the four packets with 16 pieces each.

First, let's calculate the total number of crayons in the six packets with 8 pieces each:
6 packets * 8 crayons/packet = 48 crayons

Next, let's calculate the total number of crayons in the four packets with 16 pieces each:
4 packets * 16 crayons/packet = 64 crayons

Now, we add the total number of crayons from both types of packets to find the overall total:
48 crayons + 64 crayons = 112 crayons

The final answer is: 112"
"Let's break down the information given. 

If you buy a super ticket for $20, you get one popcorn and a soda for $1 extra. This means the total cost for the super ticket, popcorn, and soda is $20 + $1 = $21. 

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the cost of the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda without the super ticket is $21 - $2 = $19.

The cost of the movie ticket is $12. So, the cost of the popcorn and soda without the super ticket is $19 - $12 = $7.

The cost of the soda is $3. So, the cost of the popcorn is $7 - $3 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as 'x'. Since the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, we can set up the equation:

20x = 900

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

x = 900 / 20
x = 45

So, the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost of filling one balloon is:

New cost = Original cost + Increase
New cost = 45 + 20
New cost = 65

Now, we need to find the total cost of filling 170 balloons at the new rate:

Total cost = New cost per balloon * Number of balloons
Total cost = 65 * 170
Total cost = 11050

The final answer is: 11050"
"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 mph x 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 mph x 1 hour
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's find the total distance traveled:
Total Distance = 120 miles + 30 miles
Total Distance = 150 miles

The total time taken for the trip is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

To find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average Speed = 50 mph

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires and rubies separately and then add them together.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. Each sapphire is worth $800, so the total value of her sapphires is 8 * $800 = $6400.

She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. This means she now has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left. 

The value of the 3 sapphires she traded is 3 * $800 = $2400. 

The value of the 2 rubies she received is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is the value of the remaining sapphires plus the value of the rubies. So, $6400 + $2400 - $2400 = $6400.

The total value of Jenna's jewels is $6400."
"To find the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of apples they eat per day and then multiply it by 30.

Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. So, together they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples per day.

Now, we multiply the total number of apples they eat per day by 30 to find the total number of apples they eat in 30 days: 8 * 30 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the total number of beds.

The volume of one raised bed is calculated as length * width * height. 
Volume = 2 feet * 8 feet * 2 feet = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:
Total Volume = 32 cubic feet/bed * 10 beds = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. To find the total number of bags needed, we divide the total volume by the volume of one bag:
Number of bags = Total Volume / Volume per bag = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:
Total Cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag = 160 bags * $12/bag = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of cards, we first need to determine the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of red cards = 15
60% of red cards = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

The final answer is: 78"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies.

After 20 minutes, one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. This means her friend saw 50 / 2 = 25 fairies. So, the total number of fairies now is 50 + 25 = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. So, the remaining number of fairies is 75 - 30 = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the total number of puppies with spots, we need to add the number of puppies with spots from Jennifer's and Brandon's dogs. Jennifer has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon has 4 puppies with spots. So, the total number of puppies with spots is 3 + 4 = 7.

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies. Jennifer has 8 puppies, and Brandon has 12 puppies. So, the total number of puppies is 8 + 12 = 20.

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to divide the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100. 

(7 / 20) * 100 = 35

The final answer is: 35"
"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and add them together.

The farmer buys 2 boxes of sugar cubes, each weighing 1 pound, so the total weight of sugar cubes is 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

He buys 4 bags of carrots, each weighing 12 pounds, so the total weight of carrots is 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

He buys 42 bales of hay, each weighing 75 pounds, so the total weight of hay is 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

He buys 20 sacks of oats, each weighing 65 pounds, so the total weight of oats is 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

The total weight of all the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds.

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight of the feed by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips needed.

3400 / 2250 = 1.511 (round up to the nearest whole number since we can't make a fraction of a trip)

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately and then add them together.

Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans of soda a week. Since an aluminum can is worth 2 cents, her weekly earnings from aluminum cans are 3 * 2 = 6 cents.

Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles of water a week. Since a plastic bottle is worth 3 cents, her weekly earnings from plastic bottles are 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

In a four-week month, Grayson's total earnings from aluminum cans would be 6 * 4 = 24 cents.

In a four-week month, Grayson's total earnings from plastic bottles would be 15 * 4 = 60 cents.

Now, let's add her earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles together: 24 + 60 = 84 cents.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we first need to determine how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate Toni's plants as follows:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find out how many plants Shondra has. Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, so:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

"To find out how many students Miss Maria has, we first need to calculate the total number of cards she has. 

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, so the total number of basketball cards is 6 * 25 = 150.

She has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200.

The total number of cards is the sum of basketball and baseball cards, which is 150 + 200 = 350.

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the remaining cards are 350 - 50 = 300.

If her students got 10 cards each, the number of students is the total remaining cards divided by the number of cards each student got, which is 300 / 10 = 30.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is 'x'. According to the problem, he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, which is x/2. He also gets two extra cookies for cleaning his room. So, the total number of cookies he gets is x/2 + 2.

We are given that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x/2 + 2 = 5.

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation: x/2 = 5 - 2, which simplifies to x/2 = 3.

Now, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for 'x': x = 3 * 2, which simplifies to x = 6.

"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert their individual lengths to feet and then add them together. 

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, a 6-inch remora is equal to 6/12 = 0.5 feet. 

There are two remoras, so their combined length is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

The combined length of the remoras is 1 foot. 

Now, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that this represents. 

The shark is 10 feet long, and the remoras are 1 foot long, so the percentage is (1/10) * 100 = 10%.

We are given that 20 students do not have a desktop computer, which is one-fourth of the total number of students. Let's represent the total number of students as 'x'. 

One-fourth of the students is equal to 20, so we can set up the equation: (1/4)x = 20

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to isolate 'x'. 

(1/4)x * 4 = 20 * 4
x = 80

So, there are 80 students at that grade level.

"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to first find the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts. 

We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find this. The formula is Total = A + B - Both, where A is the number of kids allergic to dairy, B is the number of kids allergic to peanuts, and Both is the number of kids allergic to both.

A = 9 (kids allergic to dairy)
B = 6 (kids allergic to peanuts)
Both = 3 (kids allergic to both)

Total allergic = A + B - Both = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12

Now, we know that there are 32 kids in the class. To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we subtract the total number of kids allergic from the total number of kids in the class.

Jaime has 64 eggs, but the trays can only hold 48 eggs. To find out how many eggs won't fit, we subtract the capacity from the total number of eggs: 64 - 48 = 16.

So, Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the tray.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total amount Sally spent, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza first. Since it costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, we multiply the cost of the small pizza by 3.

Cost of small pizza: $8
Cost of family-size pizza: $8 * 3 = $24

Now, we add the cost of both pizzas to find the total amount spent.

Total amount spent: $8 + $24 = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"To find the cost per individual razor after the discount, we need to first calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and coupon applied.

Since the razors are buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. She also has a $2.00 coupon, so the total cost of 1 pack will be $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since she buys 2 packs, the total cost will be 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

Now, we need to find the total number of razors in 2 packs. Since each pack contains 4 razors, 2 packs will contain 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

To find the cost per individual razor, we divide the total cost by the total number of razors: $4.00 / 8 = $0.50.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each level and add them up.

The 4 girls on the bottom are 64"" tall each. 
4 * 64"" = 256""

The 3 girls on top of the 4 are also 64"" tall each. 
3 * 64"" = 192""

The 2 girls on top of the 3 are also 64"" tall each. 
2 * 64"" = 128""

The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, let's add up the heights of all the levels:
256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 636""

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
636"" / 12 = 53 feet

The final answer is: 53"
"To find the total number of minutes Charisma walked, we need to calculate the total number of 5-minute breaks she took in a day and then multiply it by the number of days she worked.

Charisma works 8 hours a day, and she takes a 5-minute break every hour. So, the total number of 5-minute breaks in a day is 8 hours * 1 break per hour = 8 breaks per day.

Since each break is 5 minutes long, the total number of minutes she walked in a day is 8 breaks * 5 minutes per break = 40 minutes per day.

Charisma worked for 5 days, so the total number of minutes she walked is 40 minutes per day * 5 days = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine Brett's age in four years. Since Brett is currently 14 years old, in four years, he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.

According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is 14 years old now, three times his current age is 3 * 14 = 42 years old.

Since Angela will be 42 years old in four years, we need to subtract 4 from 42 to find her current age. Angela's current age is 42 - 4 = 38 years old.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides separately and then add them together.

The cost of the morning rides is the cost per ride multiplied by the number of rides. Since Paul drives twice a day for 14 days, he drives a total of 2 * 14 = 28 rides in the morning. The cost per ride is $6, so the total cost of the morning rides is 28 * $6 = $168.

The cost of the afternoon rides is also the cost per ride multiplied by the number of rides. Since Paul drives twice a day for 14 days, he drives a total of 2 * 14 = 28 rides in the afternoon. The cost per ride is $2, so the total cost of the afternoon rides is 28 * $2 = $56.

To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we add the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides: $168 + $56 = $224.

The final answer is: $224"
"To find out how many Greek orange pies they can make, we first need to determine the total number of oranges they have. 

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so she has 5 * 10 = 50 oranges. 

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges. 

In total, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges. 

Since one Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, the number of pies they can make is 120 / 3 = 40. 

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the costs for each venue.

For the first venue, the cost is a flat fee of $200, plus $5 per guest. If there are x guests, the total cost for the first venue is $200 + $5x.

For the second venue, the cost is $25 per guest. If there are x guests, the total cost for the second venue is $25x.

Since we want the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up the equation:

$200 + $5x = $25x

To solve for x, we can subtract $5x from both sides of the equation:

$200 = $20x

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by $20 to solve for x:

x = $200 / $20
x = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's denote the number of insects found by Bodhi as B, David as D, and Lily as L. 

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so we can write an equation: L = D + 7.

We also know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can write another equation: D = B/2.

We are also given that together they collected 43 insects, so the sum of the insects found by each of them is 43: L + D + B = 43.

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the third equation: (D + 7) + D + B = 43.

Combine like terms: 2D + B + 7 = 43.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2D + B = 36.

Now, substitute the second equation into this one: 2(D) + B = 36 becomes 2(B/2) + B = 36.

Simplify the equation: B + B = 36.

Combine like terms: 2B = 36.

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18.

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: D = B/2 = 18/2 = 9.

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found: L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to calculate the yards used by Mariah and her grandma separately and then add them together.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein. So, the yards used by Mariah can be calculated as:
1/4 * 364 = 91 yards

Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein, which can be calculated as:
1/2 * 364 = 182 yards

Now, let's add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma:
91 + 182 = 273 yards

The final answer is: 273"
"To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the total number of gifts her friends want and then add the 10 random gifts she bought.

First, let's calculate the total number of gifts her friends want. 2 friends want 5 gifts each, so that's 2 x 5 = 10 gifts. The other 3 friends want 2 gifts each, so that's 3 x 2 = 6 gifts. 

Now, let's add the gifts her friends want: 10 + 6 = 16 gifts.

Then, we add the 10 random gifts Cherrie bought: 16 + 10 = 26 gifts.

So, Cherrie bought a total of 26 gifts.

"To find the length of the couch, we first need to find the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, and the chair is 3 feet wide, the rug's width is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. Adding 2 feet to this gives us the length of the couch: 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's break down the information given. Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total. She bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, 1 pack of grape gum for $2, and 1 pack of green apple gum. 

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as 'x'. Since she paid half as much for the green apple gum as the grape gum, the cost of the green apple gum is $2 / 2 = $1.

The total cost of all the gum is $7. So, the total cost of the strawberry gum and the green apple gum is $7 - $2 = $5. 

Since there are 2 packs of strawberry gum, the total cost of the strawberry gum is 2x. The total cost of the green apple gum is $1. Therefore, 2x + $1 = $5.

To find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we need to solve for x. Subtracting $1 from both sides of the equation gives us 2x = $4. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us x = $2.

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2. 

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives him the most sticks per dollar spent. 

Let's calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood:

For a 2 x 4, Frederick gets 200 sticks for $4. 
Cost per stick = $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick

For a 2 x 8, Frederick gets 400 sticks for $6.
Cost per stick = $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick

Since a 2 x 8 gives him the most sticks per dollar, we'll use that. Frederick has $24 to spend, so he can buy 24 / 6 = 4 2 x 8 pieces of wood.

Total sticks from 4 2 x 8 pieces = 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks

The final answer is: 1600"
"To find the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs, we first need to determine the total number of snowshoes required. Since each dog has 4 legs and Mario has 6 dogs, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24.

Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, and each pair has 2 snowshoes, the total number of snowshoes required is 24 / 2 = 12.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of snowshoes by the cost per pair, which is $12.00. 

Total cost = 12 * $12.00 = $144.00

The final answer is: $144.00"
"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week and then subtract the cost of the weekly pass.

Janet takes two bus trips a day, five days a week. So, the total number of bus trips in a week is 2 * 5 = 10.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost of her bus trips for a week is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

The weekly bus pass costs $20. To find out how much Janet would save, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of her bus trips: $22 - $20 = $2.

Therefore, Janet would save $2 by buying a weekly bus pass. 

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. This means the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in the farm and the zoo:

Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

Total animals in the farm and the zoo combined: 40 + 80 = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can represent the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought as x.

The total number of onions and potatoes Rose bought is 12 + 4 = 16. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can set up the equation 4x = 16.

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 16 / 4 = 4.

So, Sophia bought 4 onions and 4 potatoes. 

The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 4 + 4 = 8."
"To find the number of days Andy has to reach his goal, we need to calculate the difference between his birthday and today's date. 

December has 31 days, and his birthday is on the 19th of July, which is the 7th month. So, we need to consider the remaining days in December and the days in the months from January to July.

December has 31 days, and January, February, March, April, May, and June have 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, and 30 days respectively. 

Total days from December 31st to July 19th = 31 (Dec) + 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 30 (Jun) + 19 (Jul) = 201 days

Now, we know Andy needs to lose 30 pounds, and it takes 3500 calories to lose a pound. So, the total calories he needs to burn is 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories by the number of days: 105,000 / 201 ≈ 522 calories.

The final answer is: 522"
"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate his total earnings for the week and then subtract the amount he spent.

Since Gerald works for a week, which has 7 days, and he earns $30 per day, his total earnings for the week would be:

$30/day * 7 days = $210

Now, let's subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:

$210 (total earnings) - $100 (amount spent) = $110

So, Gerald has $110 left."
"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total distance she will run. Since each lap is 0.25 km and she needs to run 8 laps, we multiply the number of laps by the distance per lap.

Total distance = 8 laps * 0.25 km/lap = 2 km

Since Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs, we multiply the total distance by the amount of water needed per kilometer.

Total water needed = 2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml

Therefore, Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water.

The final answer is: 120"

"Let's break down the problem. We know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. We also know that the house cost three times as much as the lot. 

Let's denote the cost of the lot as 'x'. Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write the equation: x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms: 4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4: x = 30,000

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house. The cost of the house is 3x, which is 3 * 30,000 = 90,000

"To find the profit, we first need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The total cost is the cost of the canvas bags, which is 8 packs * 5 bags per pack * $4 per bag = 8 * 5 * 4 = $160.

The total revenue is the selling price of the bags, which is 8 bags * $8 per bag = 8 * 8 = $64.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $64 - $160 = -$96.

However, since profit cannot be negative, it seems there might be an error in the given information. If the selling price is less than the cost, it's not possible to earn a profit."

"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we first need to determine how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can calculate Josh's cookies as follows:

Josh's cookies = Suzanne's cookies / 4
Josh's cookies = 36 / 4
Josh's cookies = 9

Now, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So, we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has. He has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. 

The total amount of money from $10 bills is 4 * $10 = $40.
The total amount of money from $20 bills is 6 * $20 = $120.
The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Now, Ali gives his sister half of the total money. Half of $160 is $160 / 2 = $80. So, Ali gives his sister $80.

The amount of money Ali has left after giving his sister $80 is $160 - $80 = $80.

Next, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. 3/5 of $80 is (3/5) * $80 = $48.

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we first need to determine how many cups of raisins she has available for the oatmeal cookies. 

Since she divides the raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, we can divide the total number of cups of raisins by 3. 

Total cups of raisins = 27
Cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies = Total cups of raisins / 3
Cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies = 27 / 3
Cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies = 9

Now, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make with 9 cups of raisins. Each batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. 

Number of batches = Cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies / Cups of raisins per batch

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we first need to calculate her daily and weekly electric consumption before and after adding the new device.

Before adding the new device, Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, her daily consumption is 12 * 24 = 288 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day. 

After adding the new device, her daily consumption will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour. So, her daily consumption will be 14 * 24 = 336 kWh per day.

Now, let's calculate her weekly consumption before and after adding the new device. There are 7 days in a week, so her weekly consumption before adding the new device is 288 * 7 = 2016 kWh. After adding the new device, her weekly consumption will be 336 * 7 = 2352 kWh.

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kWh. So, her weekly bill before adding the new device is 2016 * $1.50 = $3024. After adding the new device, her weekly bill will be 2352 * $1.50 = $3528.

The difference in her weekly electric bill is $3528 - $3024 = $504.

First, let's find the total hours spent in the weeks where he spent 4 hours each. There are 6 weeks where he spent 4 hours each, so the total hours spent in these weeks is 6 * 4 = 24 hours.

Next, let's find the total hours spent in the weeks where he spent 5 hours each. There are 2 weeks where he spent 5 hours each, so the total hours spent in these weeks is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

Finally, let's find the total hours spent in the week where he spent 6 hours. There is 1 week where he spent 6 hours, so the total hours spent in this week is 1 * 6 = 6 hours.

Now, let's add up the total hours spent in all the weeks: 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 hours.

However, we need to consider that Josh spent 4 hours each in the remaining 2 weeks. So, the total hours spent in these weeks is 2 * 4 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add the hours spent in the remaining weeks to the total hours spent in the other weeks: 40 + 8 = 48 hours.

The final answer is: 48"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is 48 - 8 = 40.

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (which is 8) get into the bus. So, 5 * 8 = 40 people get in. Now, the total number of people on the bus is 40 (who were already there) + 40 (who got in) = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is 80 - 21 = 59.

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. Since 21 got off, 3 times fewer would be 21 / 3 = 7. So, 7 people get in. Now, the total number of people on the bus is 59 (who were already there) + 7 (who got in) = 66.

The final number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is 66."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.
2. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. 
   Let's denote Jame's age in 8 years as J8 and his cousin's age in 8 years as C8. 
   We know that C8 = 2 * J8 - 5.
3. Since Jame's age in 8 years will be 22 + 8 = 30, we can substitute J8 = 30 into the equation from step 2.
   C8 = 2 * 30 - 5 = 55.
4. Now, we need to find Jame's cousin's current age. Since his age in 8 years will be 55, his current age is 55 - 8 = 47.
5. The age difference between Jame and his cousin is 47 - 22 = 25 years.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the cost of one monitor, we first need to find the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

The total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. 

Since Errol bought 2 monitors, the cost of the two monitors is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the two monitors by 2: $600 / 2 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many shells the boys brought in total. Since there are 10 boys (half of 20 kids) and each brought 60 shells, the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

Now, we know that the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + 4 * 60 shells.

First, we calculate 4 times the number of shells brought by the boys: 4 * 60 = 240.

Then, we add this to the number of shells brought by the boys: 600 + 240 = 840.

Since there are 10 girls (half of 20 kids), we need to find out how many shells each girl brought. To do this, we divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by the number of girls: 840 / 10 = 84.

The final answer is: 84"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, let's assume the number of candies George had before eating 5 candies is 'x'. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, the number of candies Nick had is 2x.

Now, George ate 5 candies, so the number of candies George has left is x - 5. We are given that George has 3 candies left, so we can set up the equation:

x - 5 = 3

To solve for x, we add 5 to both sides of the equation:

x = 3 + 5
x = 8

Now that we know George had 8 candies initially, we can find the number of candies Nick had, which is 2x:

Number of candies Nick had = 2x
= 2 * 8
= 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find Anne's age, we first need to find Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, Alyana's age is 10 - 4 = 6 years.

Now, we know that Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so Anne's age is 6 + 2 = 8 years.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it's 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it's 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together: 
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188

The final answer is: 188"
"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we first need to calculate the total number of vlogs she has already made. 

In the first week, Emma made 18 vlogs. 
In the second week, Emma made 21 vlogs. 
In the third week, Emma made 15 vlogs.

Total vlogs made = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Since Emma can make 72 vlogs per month, to find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the total vlogs made from the target.

Vlogs needed = 72 - 54 = 18

So, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month.

"To find the total amount you paid, first, calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill. 

20% of $50 is calculated as 0.20 * $50 = $10.

Now, add the tip to the original bill: $50 + $10 = $60.

Since your wife wants to split the check evenly, you'll pay half of the total amount: $60 / 2 = $30.

The final answer is: $30"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, $18 is shared among 3 boys. This means each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy added $5 to his share, so he now has $6 + $5 = $11.

The following day, he added another $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

Then, he spent $8 from his total, so he now has $21 - $8 = $13.

After saving some more, he tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8. This means he now has 3 * $13 = $39.

The final answer is: $39"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how much Elvis needs to save in the first half of the month. 

Let's assume the number of days in the first half of April is x. Since April has 30 days, the number of days in the second half will also be x. 

The total number of days in April is 30, so x + x = 30. 
Solving for x, we get 2x = 30, x = 15. 

So, the first half of April has 15 days and the second half also has 15 days.

Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half. Let's assume he saves y dollars in the first half. Then, he will save 2y dollars in the second half.

The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings in the first and second half, which is equal to the target of $1125. 

So, y + 2y = 1125. 
Combining like terms, we get 3y = 1125. 
Dividing both sides by 3, we get y = 375.

Now that we know Elvis saves $375 in the first half, we can find out how much he needs to save in the second half. Since he needs to save twice as much in the second half, he will save 2y = 2 * 375 = 750 dollars in the second half.

The final answer is: $750"
"To find the total cost of the fruits, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of 3 apples at $1.50 each is 3 x $1.50 = $4.50.
The cost of 5 oranges at $0.80 each is 5 x $0.80 = $4.
The cost of 6 peaches at $0.75 each is 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4.50 + $4 + $4.50 = $13.

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is $20 - $13 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we need to calculate the total amount each of them will get for completing 20 tasks.

Jairus gets $0.8 for each task, so for 20 tasks, he will get 20 * $0.8 = $16.

Jenny gets $0.5 for each task, so for 20 tasks, she will get 20 * $0.5 = $10.

Now, to find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's total from Jairus's total: $16 - $10 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, and the total amount they have to divide is $100.

Let's represent the amount Brad gets as 'x'. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, the amount Jeff gets is 4x.

The total amount they have to divide is $100, so we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Now, divide both sides by 5 to solve for x:

x = 20

Since x represents the amount Brad gets, and Jeff gets 4 times as much, Jeff gets 4x:

Jeff's amount = 4x = 4(20) = 80

So, Jeff gets $80.

The final answer is: $80"
"To find the total miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he walks in a day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

Since Jeff walks to work and back each day, the total miles he walks in a day is 2 times the distance to work, which is 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles.

Now, we multiply the daily miles by the number of days he works in a week: 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the process step by step.

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, which means she writes 26 letters each time. So, in this step, she writes 26 * 2 = 52 letters.

2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of the alphabet is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.

3. So, in this step, she writes 13 letters.

4. Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written. This means she re-writes 52 (from the first two steps) + 13 (from the third step) = 65 letters.

Now, let's add up all the letters she has written: 
52 (from the first two steps) + 13 (from the third step) + 65 (from the fourth step) = 130

The total number of letters Elise has written is: 130"
"This problem can be solved using the concept of exponential growth. In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families being notified. 

In the third round, each of the 9 families (from the second round) calls 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families being notified. 

Now, let's calculate the number of families notified in the fourth round. In the third round, there were 9 families who made calls. Each of these 9 families will call 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families being notified in the fourth round. However, we also need to consider the families that were notified in the previous rounds. 

In the first round, 3 families were notified. In the second round, 9 families were notified. In the third round, 27 families were notified. So, the total number of families notified in the previous rounds is 3 + 9 + 27 = 39. 

Now, we add the new families notified in the fourth round (27) to the total number of families notified in the previous rounds (39). This gives us 39 + 27 = 66. However, this is not the total number of families notified in the fourth round. We also need to consider the families that were notified in the previous rounds and will make calls in the fourth round. 

In the first round, 3 families made calls. In the second round, 9 families made calls. In the third round, 27 families made calls. So, the total number of families that made calls in the previous rounds is 3 + 9 + 27 = 39. 

Now, we multiply the number of families that made calls in the previous rounds (39) by the number of new families each of them will notify (3). This gives us 39 * 3 = 117. 

However, this is the total number of new families that will be notified in the fourth round. To find the total number of families notified in the fourth round, we add the new families notified (117) to the total number of families notified in the previous rounds (39). This gives us 117 + 39 = 156.

"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost and then add that to his final weight.

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so the total weight he lost is:
10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Now, we add the total weight lost to his final weight to find his initial weight:
Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Jonathan needs to have a play set five times larger than James's. Since James's play set has 80 toys, a play set five times larger would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys.

Since Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a play set five times larger than James's, let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as 'x'. This means that x + 2 = 400.

To find the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we need to solve for 'x'. Subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation gives us x = 400 - 2.

x = 398

"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the items Daniel wants to buy without the discount. 

The cost of 5 notebooks at $1.50 each is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.
The cost of 2 pens at $0.25 each is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.
The cost of 1 calculator at $12 each is $12.
The cost of 1 geometry set at $10 each is $10.

The total cost without the discount is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

Since the shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items, we need to calculate 10% of $30.
10% of $30 is 0.1 * $30 = $3.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final amount Daniel has to spend.
$30 - $3 = $27.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. 

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as in cold water. Since it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile in cold water, twice that time is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. Adding 2 minutes to that gives us 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water. 

In cold water, it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile, so for 3 miles it would be 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.

In warm water, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile, so for 3 miles it would be 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many cups of coffee Juan currently drinks. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, and Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, we need to know the daily recommended amount of coffee.

Let's assume the daily recommended amount of coffee is 'x'. Then, Octavia drinks x/2 cups of coffee. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups of coffee.

We are given that Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. So, we need to find the difference between the amount of coffee Juan currently drinks and the recommended amount.

The difference is 5x - 4.

However, we don't know the value of 'x'. To find the difference, we need to know the daily recommended amount of coffee. 

Since the problem doesn't provide the daily recommended amount of coffee, we can assume it to be a general question and provide the answer in terms of 'x'. 

The difference is 5x - 4.

However, if we assume the daily recommended amount of coffee is 4 cups, then the difference would be 5x - 4 = 5(4) - 4 = 20 - 4 = 16.

But since we don't know the value of 'x', we can't provide a numerical answer. However, if we assume the daily recommended amount of coffee is 4 cups, then the answer would be 16.

"To find out how many packs of candles James needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of candles required. Since James has two sons, one 12 years old and the other 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Assuming each child needs a certain number of candles based on their age, let's assume a standard number of candles per age. For simplicity, let's assume 1 candle per year. So, the 12-year-old would need 12 candles and the 8-year-old would need 8 candles.

Total candles needed = 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy.

"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she read in the first week and then convert that to pages. 

In the first week, she read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Given that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes. First, let's find out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 105 minutes. 

105 minutes / 1.5 minutes per interval = 70 intervals

Now, we know she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. So, in 70 intervals, she can read 2 * 70 = 140 pages in the first week.

"Let's break down the information given. We know that Richie scored 80 goals. We also know that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark and 45 more goals than Anna.

Let's denote Mark's goals as M and Anna's goals as A. We can set up two equations based on the given information:

1. Richie's goals = Mark's goals + 20
   80 = M + 20
   M = 60

2. Richie's goals = Anna's goals + 45
   80 = A + 45
   A = 35

Now that we know Mark scored 60 goals and Anna scored 35 goals, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers.

Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

"To find out how much more money Mitchell made than Liam, we first need to calculate the total amount of money each of them made. 

Liam made $63 in total. 

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece, so we multiply the number of lemonades by the price per lemonade: 21 * 4 = 84. 

Now, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings to find the difference: 84 - 63 = 21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To find out how many action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we first need to determine how much money he has left after buying wooden action figures from Sunday to Wednesday.

Peter spent $5 each day for 4 days (Sunday to Wednesday) on wooden action figures. So, the total amount spent on wooden action figures is 4 * $5 = $20.

He started with $70, so after buying wooden action figures, he has $70 - $20 = $50 left.

Now, let's calculate how many plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining money. He will buy plastic action figures for the rest of the week, which is from Thursday to Saturday. There are 4 days left in the week.

The cost of each plastic action figure is $2. So, the total number of plastic action figures he can buy is $50 / $2 = 25.

Now, let's add the number of wooden action figures he bought (4) to the number of plastic action figures he bought (25) to find the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week.

Total action figures = 4 (wooden) + 25 (plastic) = 29

The final answer is: 29"
"To calculate the total cost of the kitten, we need to add up the cost of spaying, vaccines, and the broken vases.

The cost of spaying is $200.
The cost of 3 vaccines is 3 x $20 = $60.
The cost of 4 broken vases is 4 x $12 = $48.

Now, let's add up the costs: $200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccines) + $48 (broken vases) = $308.

The final answer is: $308"
"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The total number of roses ordered per week is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is 65 * 4 = 260 roses.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is 40 * 4 = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month: 260 - 160 = 100 roses.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how much money will be remaining in Katina's account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she will withdraw over that period.

There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are 2 x 12 = 24 months.

Katina removes $100 from her account every month, so the total amount she will withdraw in 24 months is 24 x $100 = $2400.

Initially, Katina had $3000 in her account. After withdrawing $2400, she will be left with $3000 - $2400 = $600.

So, the amount of money remaining in Katina's account after 2 years will be $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 per loaf, and since each loaf makes 10 sandwiches, the cost per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30 per sandwich. 

The cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00. So, the cost per sandwich is $30.00 / 10 = $3.00 per sandwich.

The total cost per sandwich is the sum of the cost of bread and cheese/condiments, which is $0.30 + $3.00 = $3.30 per sandwich.

The total revenue from selling 10 sandwiches at $7.00 each is 10 * $7.00 = $70.00.

The total cost for 10 sandwiches is 10 * $3.30 = $33.00.

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00.

The net profit is $37.00."
"To find out how much money Kate can make, we first need to determine how many muffin crayons she can make. Since she melts 8 small pieces of crayons together in each muffin tin, and there are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we need to find the total number of small pieces of crayons.

First, let's find the total number of small pieces of crayons: 
3 boxes * 64 crayons per box = 192 crayons

Since each box has 64 crayons, and there are 3 boxes, we multiply 3 * 64 to get the total number of crayons. 

Now, we need to find out how many small pieces of crayons Kate has in total. However, the problem does not specify how many small pieces of crayons are in each box. We can assume that each box has 64 small pieces of crayons, but we need to clarify this assumption.

Assuming each box has 64 small pieces of crayons, we can proceed with the calculation. 

Now, let's find the total number of muffin crayons Kate can make:
192 small pieces of crayons / 8 small pieces per muffin = 24 muffin crayons

Since Kate can make 24 muffin crayons, and she can sell each muffin crayon for $1.50, we can find the total amount of money she can make:
24 muffin crayons * $1.50 per muffin crayon = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the area of the bedroom and then calculate the cost of the new carpet, padding, and installation.

The area of the bedroom is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the new carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 * $12 = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 * $2 = $432.

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removing the old carpet is 216 * $4 = $864.

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installing the new carpet is 216 * $34 = $7344.

The total cost of replacing the carpet is the sum of the cost of the new carpet, padding, removing the old carpet, and installing the new carpet: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11332.

The total cost of replacing the carpet is $11332.

"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to calculate the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide it by the number of days.

Total birds seen on days 1 and 2: 50
Total birds seen on days 4 and 5: 120
Total birds seen on day 6: 20
Total birds seen on day 7: 90

Total birds seen over the week = 50 + 50 + 0 + 120 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 350

There are 7 days in a week. 

Average number of birds seen per day = Total birds seen over the week / Number of days

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the percentage by which the oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, and then divide it by the set temperature.

The difference between the actual and set temperature is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees.

The percentage by which the oven is off is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Since the oven is off by 4% for any recipe, we need to find the temperature that is 4% less than 520 degrees.

To do this, we can calculate 4% of 520 and subtract it from 520.

4% of 520 is (4/100) * 520 = 20.8.

Now, subtract 20.8 from 520 to get the temperature Maggie should set her oven to: 520 - 20.8 = 499.2.

The final answer is: 499.2"
"To find the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time as follows:
1 hour = 60 minutes
Adding the 30 minutes, we get:
60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting the time to minutes:
2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes
Adding the 5 minutes, we get:
120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Now, we add the time of both movies together:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

The final answer is: 215"
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's house price. 

30% of $76,000 = 0.30 * $76,000 = $22,800

Now, subtract $22,800 from Herb's house price to find Juan's house price:
$76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

The combined value of the two houses is the sum of their individual prices:
$76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

The final answer is: $129,200"
"To find the total number of utensils brought by Judy, we first need to determine how many cups and dishes she brought. 

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of utensils brought by Judy: 12 cups + 24 dishes = 36 utensils.

The total number of utensils brought by Judy is 36.

Now, let's calculate the total number of utensils brought by Judy's friend: 40 cups + 44 dishes = 84 utensils.

The total number of utensils brought by Judy's friend is 84.

To find the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend, we add the number of utensils each brought: 36 (Judy) + 84 (her friend) = 120 utensils.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost per pair of contacts, we first need to determine the total number of contacts in 2 boxes and the total cost of 2 boxes with the discount.

Since 90 contacts last 45 days, we can find the number of contacts Pete uses per day: 90 contacts / 45 days = 2 contacts per day.

In 2 boxes, there will be 2 * 90 = 180 contacts.

The total cost of 2 boxes with a 10% discount is 2 * $100.00 * 0.9 = $180.00.

Now, to find the cost per pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts: $180.00 / 180 contacts = $1.00 per contact.

Since a pair of contacts is 2 contacts, the cost per pair of contacts is $1.00 * 2 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate their individual earnings first.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, for a total of 3 hours. Her hourly wage is $10, so her total earnings are 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours. His total earnings are 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how much water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories she burns during her activities. 

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned during aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

She spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned during running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Total calories burned = calories burned during aerobics + calories burned during running = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we need to find out how many sets of 200 calories are there in 1600 calories.

1600 calories / 200 calories = 8 sets.

Since she needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she needs to drink 8 sets * 100 ml = 800 ml of water.

The final answer is: 800"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Let's assume the number of blue jelly beans is B. 
Since there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of red jelly beans is B - 0.01B = 0.99B. 
Since there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of green jelly beans is B + 0.01B = 1.01B.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500. So, the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans is 4500. 
Therefore, 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500. 
Combine like terms: 2.99B = 4500. 
Divide both sides by 2.99: B = 1500.

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans. 
Number of red jelly beans = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485. 
Number of green jelly beans = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515.

To find the difference between the number of green and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans: 1515 - 1485 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"

"To find the total number of people attending, we need to break down the information given. 

First, Alex invites 100 people via email. Each of these people will bring 2 friends, so we multiply 100 by 2 to get 200. 

Now, Alex also calls 10 friends and 8 of them will be bringing their spouses. This means 8 more people will be attending. 

However, we also need to consider the 10 friends Alex called, and their spouses. Since 8 of them are already accounted for, 2 of them will be attending alone. 

So, the total number of people attending is 100 (initial invitees) + 200 (friends of invitees) + 2 (friends of Alex) + 8 (spouses of friends) = 310.

Therefore, Alex will need 310 seats.

The cost of the boots on eBay is $13. 
The shipping cost on eBay is twice as much as on Amazon, which is 2 * $4 = $8.

So, the total cost of the boots on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, let's find the total cost of the boots on Amazon. 
The cost of the boots on Amazon is $16. 
The shipping cost on Amazon is $4.

So, the total cost of the boots on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay.
$21 - $20 = $1.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we first need to find out how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein percentage in a cup of mushrooms by dividing the protein by the weight: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 or 3%.

Now, we know that John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we multiply the weight of mushrooms he eats by the protein percentage: 200 grams * 0.03 = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to find the weekly protein intake: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let Jerry's current age be 'x'. Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can write an equation based on this information:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:
x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides of the equation, we get:
-x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1, we get:
x = 10

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
Jerry's age in 3 years = 10 + 3 = 13

"To find out how many hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. 

The base price for 2 implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. 
For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost for the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500. 
However, since he's getting two implants, he'll need to pay for the crown on the second implant as well. Therefore, the total cost is $4500 + $500 = $5000. 

George has already put down a deposit of $600. So, the remaining amount he needs to pay is $5000 - $600 = $4400.

Since George makes $15 per hour at work, to find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $4400 / $15 = 293.33 hours.

The final answer is: 293.33"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as 'x'. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it's 2x. The other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it's 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

One angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
The other angle is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

First, let's convert the coins to cents:

- 14 nickels = 14 * 5 = 70 cents
- 15 pennies = 15 * 1 = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has:
Total money = 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many Colby can buy:
Number of gumballs = Total money / Cost per gumball = 345 / 5 = 69

"To find the rate at which the plane is traveling, we need to divide the distance it traveled by the time it took. 

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we need to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this rate.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Since the question asks for the additional hours, we need to subtract the initial time from the total time.

Additional hours = Total time - Initial time
Additional hours = 5 hours - 3 hours
Additional hours = 2 hours

"To find out how much Marissa makes in an hour, we need to first find out how much Ruiz makes in an hour. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, we can divide 120 by 2 to get the amount made in an hour.

Ruiz's hourly production = 120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, we can find Marissa's hourly production by multiplying 120 by 3/4 and then dividing by 2.

Marissa's hourly production = (120 * 3/4) / 2 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, we know that both Ruiz and Marissa work for 12 hours a day. We can find their total production by multiplying their hourly production by the number of hours they work.

Ruiz's total production = 60 * 12 = 720 pounds
Marissa's total production = 45 * 12 = 540 pounds

Total production = Ruiz's total production + Marissa's total production
Total production = 720 + 540
Total production = 1260 pounds

"To find out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to calculate the total number of rotations the tire can handle and divide it by the number of rotations per 2 miles, then divide the result by the number of miles Jeremy drives per month.

First, let's find out how many rotations the tire can handle per mile: 
725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile

Now, let's find out how many rotations the tire can handle in total: 
10,440,000 rotations

Now, let's find out how many miles the tire can handle: 
10,440,000 rotations / 362.5 rotations per mile = 28,700 miles

Now, let's find out how many months the tire can handle: 
28,700 miles / 400 miles per month = 71.75 months

Now, let's convert months to years: 
71.75 months / 12 months per year = 5.979 years

"To find the cost per pump, we need to first find the total number of pumps in the bottle. Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, and Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the total number of pumps in the bottle is 120 * 2 = 240 pumps.

The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00, which is equivalent to 2400 cents. 

To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps: 2400 cents / 240 pumps = 10 cents per pump.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much money Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is $25 + $35 = $60.

Since there's a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount. To do this, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage (30% or 0.3). The discount amount is $60 * 0.3 = $18.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost of the items. $60 - $18 = $42.

Since sales tax is included in the prices, we don't need to add any additional tax to the final cost.

Finally, we subtract the final cost from the initial amount of money Joe has. $50 - $42 = $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants he wants to make in a week. Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day, and there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 4 dozen by 7.

4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can convert 28 dozen to individual croissants:

28 dozen * 12 croissants/dozen = 336 croissants

Now, we know it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find out how much butter is needed for 336 croissants, we first convert the number of croissants to dozens:

336 croissants / 12 croissants/dozen = 28 dozen

Now, we multiply the number of dozens by the amount of butter needed per dozen:

28 dozen * (1/4 pound/dozen) = 28 * 0.25 = 7 pounds

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 336 croissants.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the cost of repaving Lewis' street, we need to multiply the cost per meter by the length of his street. 

Cost per meter: $194
Length of Lewis' street: 490 meters

Cost to repave Lewis' street = Cost per meter * Length of Lewis' street
Cost to repave Lewis' street = $194 * 490
Cost to repave Lewis' street = $95,060

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's, we need to calculate the cost of repaving Monica's street and then subtract it from the cost of repaving Lewis' street.

Cost to repave Monica's street = Cost per meter * Length of Monica's street
Cost to repave Monica's street = $194 * 150
Cost to repave Monica's street = $29,100

Now, let's find the difference in cost:
Difference in cost = Cost to repave Lewis' street - Cost to repave Monica's street
Difference in cost = $95,060 - $29,100
Difference in cost = $65,960

"To find the total cost of John's research, we first need to determine the total number of months it took for the research to be completed. Since it took 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, the total duration is 5 * 10 = 50 months.

The initial 5 months cost $100,000. After that, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the cost for each of the remaining 45 months (50 - 5 = 45) is 1.5 times the initial cost.

The cost for the first 5 months is $100,000. The cost for the remaining 45 months is 45 * $100,000 * 1.5 = $6,750,000.

The total cost is the sum of the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining 45 months: $100,000 + $6,750,000 = $6,850,000.

"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim chews during school, we need to calculate how many 2-hour intervals are in an 8-hour school day. 

8 hours / 2 hours per interval = 4 intervals

Since Jim chews 1 piece of gum per 2-hour interval, he chews 4 pieces during school.

He also chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.

Total pieces chewed = 4 (during school) + 2 (on the way home and after dinner) = 6 pieces

Jim started with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

However, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 7.

So, Jim gives 7 pieces to his sister and has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces left.

"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to calculate the difference between the required height (4 feet) and Adam's current height (40 inches), and then divide that by his growth rate (2 inches per year).

First, let's convert the required height to inches: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.

Now, let's calculate the difference between the required height and Adam's current height: 48 inches - 40 inches = 8 inches.

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we can divide the difference by his growth rate to find out how many years it will take for him to reach the required height: 8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To find out how much James made, we first need to calculate the profit from each car. 

The cost of each car to the company is 30% of $25,000, which is 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500. 
The selling price of each car is $25,000. 
The profit from each car is $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

James got a 10% commission on the profits, which is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

So, James made $17,500."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright on the wave. This means 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders can stay upright.

Next, we are told that 60% of these 25 riders are women. To find the number of women, we multiply 25 by 0.6, which gives us 15 women.

Since the remaining riders who can stay upright are men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright. So, 25 - 15 = 10 men can stay upright on the wave.

"To find the total price for all three jewels, we first need to find the prices of the gold and silver jewels.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, and the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold, so we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps, we add the number of each type of stamp together: 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the relative speed between Bob and Tom. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed to get the relative speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph
Relative speed = -15 mph

However, since we are dealing with a time problem, we need to consider the absolute value of the relative speed. The negative sign indicates that Tom is actually gaining on Bob, but we are interested in the rate at which he is gaining.

Absolute relative speed = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

The distance between Bob and Tom is 75 miles. We want to find the time it takes for Tom to cover this distance at the relative speed.

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

Darren's catch = Naomi's catch - 6
Darren's catch = 17 - 6
Darren's catch = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can find out how many Tommy caught by adding 3 to Darren's catch.

Tommy's catch = Darren's catch + 3
Tommy's catch = 11 + 3
Tommy's catch = 14

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to determine the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's assume the cost per class is $10. If Manny attends all 10 classes, the total cost would be 10 classes * $10 per class = $100. However, he signed up for $60, so he has a remaining balance of $40.

Since he has a remaining balance of $40, he can miss classes without exceeding the $10 per class limit. To find out how many classes he can miss, we need to divide the remaining balance by the cost per class.

$40 (remaining balance) / $10 (cost per class) = 4 classes

So, Manny can miss 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

The cost of 3 oranges is $3.30, so the cost of one orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Now, we can find the cost of 5 apples: 5 apples * $1.30/apple = $6.50.

Next, we can find the cost of 5 oranges: 5 oranges * $1.10/orange = $5.50.

Finally, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges: $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

"To find out how much Tim will make in a year, we first need to calculate his new monthly salary and the bonus.

His new monthly salary is a 5% raise on his current $20,000 salary. 
5% of $20,000 is 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000. 
So, his new monthly salary is $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000.

The bonus is half a month's salary, which is $21,000 / 2 = $10,500.

Now, let's calculate his total monthly income: $21,000 (new salary) + $10,500 (bonus) = $31,500.

"To find the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, then add those times together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil. Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil, and he needs to dig 24 feet of soil. 

Time to dig through soil = Total soil depth / Rate of digging through soil
Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour
Time to dig through soil = 6 hours

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay. Bill can dig half as fast through clay as he can through soil, so his rate of digging through clay is 4 / 2 = 2 feet/hour. He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

Time to dig through clay = Total clay depth / Rate of digging through clay
Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour
Time to dig through clay = 4 hours

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay to get the total time.

Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours
Total time = 10 hours

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of cupcakes Howie needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of people and multiply it by 2 (since he's getting 2 cupcakes for each person).

There are 25 classmates and 2 more people (Howie and his teacher), so the total number of people is 25 + 2 = 27.

Since each person gets 2 cupcakes, the total number of cupcakes needed is 27 * 2 = 54.

So, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes.

The final answer is: 54"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Fishio received 2000 likes on her selfie.

Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. 
So, the number of likes after 3 weeks = 70 * 2000 = 140000.

Now, she received 20000 more new likes recently. 
So, the total number of likes = 140000 + 20000 = 160000.

The final answer is: 160000"
"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost for each day and then subtract the two amounts.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got a $2 discount. So, the total cost for the first day is:

20 pomegranates * $20 = $400
Discount: $2
Total cost for the first day = $400 - $2 = $398

On the second day, the price per pomegranate is $30, and there's a 10% discount on the total cost. So, the total cost for the second day is:

20 pomegranates * $30 = $600
Discount: 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Total cost for the second day = $600 - $60 = $540

Now, let's find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days:

Difference = Total cost for the second day - Total cost for the first day
= $540 - $398
= $142

The final answer is: $142"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total sales from green hats in the first month as 'x'. Since the sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, the sales from red hats would be x/2.

We know that the total sales from red hats in the first month were $400. So, we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 400

To find the value of 'x', we multiply both sides by 2:

x = 400 * 2
x = 800

So, the total sales from green hats in the first month were $800.

Now, let's find the total sales from both red and green hats in the first month:

Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
= 400 + 800
= 1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month would be:

Sales in the second month = 3/4 * 1200
= 900

Now, let's find the total sales in two months:

Total sales in two months = Sales in the first month + Sales in the second month
= 1200 + 900
= 2100

The final answer is: $2100"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of paid hours and the cost for each hour. 

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so he only paid for 3 hours.

The first paid hour costs $15. Each subsequent hour costs twice the previous hour, so the second hour costs $15 * 2 = $30, and the third hour costs $30 * 2 = $60.

The total cost is the sum of the costs of the three paid hours: $15 + $30 + $60 = $105.

The final answer is: $105"
"To find out how much was withheld from Sally's wage, we need to determine the total amount she should have received if she was paid her full wage. 

Since her weekly wage should be $300, and her bank account now holds $420, which is $200 more than the initial amount, we can infer that the $200 increase is the result of her full wage being paid. 

However, since her bank account now holds $420, and she should have $300 for her full wage, the difference between the two amounts is $420 - $300 = $120. 

But, we know that the $200 increase is the result of her full wage being paid, so we need to subtract the initial amount from the current amount to find the total amount she should have received. 

$420 - $200 = $220. 

Now, we need to find out how much was withheld from her wage. We know that she should have received $300, but she only received $220. 

$300 - $220 = $80.

So, $80 was withheld from Sally's wage.

The final answer is: $80"
"To find out how many deviled egg halves Lori's guests will eat, we need to multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat. 

Number of guests: 16
Number of deviled egg halves per guest: 3

Total deviled egg halves: 16 * 3 = 48

Since Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many deviled egg halves 1 egg can make. 

1 egg makes 2 deviled egg halves

Now, we need to find out how many eggs are needed to make 48 deviled egg halves.

48 deviled egg halves / 2 deviled egg halves per egg = 24 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Lori needs.

24 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 2 dozens

So, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs.

"To find out how many days it will take Mike to finish reading the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read per day.

Total pages = 200
Pages read per day = 10

Days to finish reading = Total pages / Pages read per day
Days to finish reading = 200 / 10
Days to finish reading = 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we need to subtract the number of days it will take him to finish reading from the total number of days.

Days before deadline = Total days - Days to finish reading
Days before deadline = 30 - 20
Days before deadline = 10

"To find the total cost for the first year, we need to calculate the cost of the plane, the hanger rental, and the fuel. 

The cost of the plane is $150,000. 

The hanger rental is $5000 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total hanger rental cost for the first year is $5000 * 12 = $60,000.

The fuel cost is twice the hanger rental, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month. The total fuel cost for the first year is $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

Now, we add the cost of the plane, the hanger rental, and the fuel to find the total cost for the first year: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $230,000 + $60,000 = $290,000 + $120,000 = $310,000.

The total cost for the first year is $310,000.

The final answer is: $310,000"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. It took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice.
2. It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so it took her 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook pork.
3. Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of 80 is 40 minutes.

Now, let's add up the cooking times for all the food: 
- Rice: 30 minutes
- Pork: 50 minutes
- Beans: 40 minutes

Total cooking time = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes

"To find the cost difference, we first need to calculate the cost of each mixture. 

For the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts), we need to find the total cost. 
Cost of almonds = (1/2) * $10 = $5
Cost of walnuts = (1/3) * $15 = $5
Total cost of the first mixture = $5 + $5 = $10

For the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts), we need to find the total cost.
Cost of almonds = (1/5) * $10 = $2
Cost of walnuts = (1/3) * $15 = $5
Total cost of the second mixture = $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures.
Difference in cost = Total cost of the first mixture - Total cost of the second mixture

"Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, we can set up the following equation based on the total number of legs:

4S + 2G = 70

We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, which means the sum of the number of sheep and geese is 20:

S + G = 20

We can solve the second equation for G:

G = 20 - S

Now, substitute G in the first equation:

4S + 2(20 - S) = 70

Expand the equation:

4S + 40 - 2S = 70

Combine like terms:

2S + 40 = 70

Subtract 40 from both sides:

2S = 30

Divide both sides by 2:

S = 15

"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the coffee. 

Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, and he wants a week's worth, which is 7 days. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but his favorite brand is sold out, so he buys the more expensive brand. The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand. 

20% of $5 is 0.2 * $5 = $1. So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

The total cost of the coffee is 7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42.

He also buys a donut for $2. 

The total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to first determine the total number of good days recorded by Christina. We know that she had 12 good days in the first 30 days. However, we also know that her first 8 days were good, her second 8 days were bad, and her third 8 days were neutral. 

So, the good days in the first 24 days are already accounted for (8 good days in the first 8 days and 4 good days in the last 3 days). This means that the 12 good days mentioned in the problem statement are actually the good days in the last 6 days of the month. 

Since we are asked to find the number of good days left in the month, we need to find the number of good days in the last 6 days of the month. We know that there are 4 good days in the last 3 days of the month. 

To find the number of good days in the first 3 days of the last 6 days, we need to subtract the 4 good days from the 12 good days. However, we are not given any information about the first 3 days of the last 6 days. 

But we are given that the first 8 days were good, the second 8 days were bad, and the third 8 days were neutral. This means that the first 24 days are already accounted for. The 12 good days are actually the good days in the last 6 days of the month. 

Since we know that the 4 good days are in the last 3 days, we can conclude that the 8 good days in the last 6 days are in the first 3 days of the last 6 days. 

So, the number of good days left in the month is 8.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that Janey has 21 books and that she has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. 

Let's represent the number of books Sally has as 'x'. According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, so we can write an equation:

Janey's books = 2 * Sally's books + 3
21 = 2x + 3

Now, we need to solve for 'x'. To do this, we'll subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

21 - 3 = 2x + 3 - 3
18 = 2x

Next, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate 'x':

18 / 2 = 2x / 2
9 = x

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we need to first convert the initial height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we multiply 20 feet by 12 inches per foot.

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we know the bamboo grows 30 inches a day and it's currently 240 inches tall. To find out how many days it will take to reach 600 inches, we subtract the current height from the target height and divide by the daily growth rate.

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Now, we divide the remaining height by the daily growth rate.

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. This means each dog has 1 toy. When 8 more dogs arrive, James needs 8 more toys to bring the total to 12 dogs with 1 toy each. So, he buys 8 more toys.

Now, there are 12 dogs, and James comes back to find that there are twice as many more dogs, which means there are 2 * 8 = 16 more dogs. This makes the total number of dogs 12 + 16 = 28. Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 28 more toys.

However, when James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys. This means he only needs 28 - 3 = 25 more toys.

Initially, James had 4 toys. He bought 8 more toys, then 28 more toys, and finally, he didn't need 3 toys. So, the total number of toys he bought is 8 + 28 - 3 = 33.

The total number of toys James needs is 33."

"To find out how much the elevator will exceed its maximum load, we first need to calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults. 

Jack's weight is not given, but we know the average weight of an adult is 80 kg. Since there are 9 adults (Jack and 8 others), we multiply the average weight by the number of adults: 9 * 80 kg = 720 kg.

Now, we subtract the total weight of the adults from the maximum load of the elevator to find the excess weight: 700 kg - 720 kg = -20 kg.

However, since we can't have a negative excess weight, it seems there's an issue with the calculation. Let's re-evaluate the problem. The question asks how much they will exceed the maximum load, implying the total weight should be greater than the maximum load. 

If we assume Jack's weight is also 80 kg, the total weight of the adults would be 9 * 80 kg = 720 kg. However, this is less than the maximum load of 700 kg. 

To exceed the maximum load, we need to add more weight. Let's assume Jack's weight is also 80 kg. The total weight of the 8 other adults is 8 * 80 kg = 640 kg. Adding Jack's weight, the total weight is 640 kg + 80 kg = 720 kg. 

To exceed the maximum load, we need to add more weight. Let's add 1 kg to the total weight: 720 kg + 1 kg = 721 kg. Now, we subtract the maximum load from this total weight to find the excess weight: 721 kg - 700 kg = 21 kg.

"To find the total number of cookies, we need to determine the number of cookies each person has. 

We know Katarina has 68 cookies. 

Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, we can find the total number of cookies by adding the number of cookies each person has: 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298.

"To find the original length of the dress, we need to consider the two changes made to the dress. 

First, the dress is extended by 50% of its original length. Let's call the original length 'x'. The extension is 50% of x, which is 0.5x. 

The total length after the extension is x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

Then, 20cm is added to the bottom of the dress. So, the final length is 1.5x + 20.

We are given that the final length is 140cm. We can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. Subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

1.5x = 120

Now, divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 80

The original length of the dress was 80cm.

"To find out how many cookies are in the box, we first need to determine the total number of cookies baked by Greta and Celinda. Greta bakes 30 cookies, and Celinda bakes twice as many, which is 2 * 30 = 60 cookies. 

So, the total number of cookies baked is 30 + 60 = 90 cookies. 

After eating 10 cookies, the number of cookies left is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

Therefore, there are 80 cookies in the box. 

80"
"Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as T+7 - 7 = T. 

Since there are two twins and one triplet, the total age is 2T + (T) = 3T. We are given that their combined ages are 44, so we can set up the equation 3T = 44.

To find the value of T, we divide both sides of the equation by 3: T = 44 / 3. 

T = 14.67. However, since age cannot be a fraction, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. 

One of the twins is 14 years old."
"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we first need to calculate the total time he spends on his homework. 

Math homework: 20 minutes
Reading homework: 40 minutes
History homework: 20 minutes
Total homework time: 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before dinner. We need to convert 3 hours to minutes: 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total available time: 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to find the cost of one candy. 

We know that Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for $3.20. The cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2. 

Now, we subtract the cost of 5 lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of 4 candies: $3.20 - $2 = $1.20. 

The cost of one candy is $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, we can find the total cost of 10 lollipops: 10 * $0.40 = $4.

The total cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4 + $3 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To find out how many coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we first need to calculate how many coins each of them saves per year and then multiply it by 10.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. To find out how many coins he saves per year, we multiply 20 by 12 (the number of months in a year).

20 * 12 = 240 coins per year for Rong.

Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. To find out how many coins Neil saves per month, we first find 2/5 of 20, which is (2/5) * 20 = 8. Then we add this to 20 to get the total coins Neil saves per month: 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

To find out how many coins Neil saves per year, we multiply 28 by 12: 28 * 12 = 336 coins per year.

Now, we multiply the number of coins each of them saves per year by 10 to find out how many coins they have after 10 years.

Rong's total coins after 10 years: 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Neil's total coins after 10 years: 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

5760"
"To find the total bill, we first need to calculate the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, which means the remaining 40% is the cost of the vaccines. So, the cost of the vaccines is 40% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill 'x'. Then, 40% of x is $40. 

To find x, we can set up the equation: 0.4x = 40. Solving for x, we get x = 40 / 0.4 = $100. 

Now that we know the total bill is $100, we can find the cost of the heartworm check, which is 60% of $100. 60% of $100 is 0.6 * 100 = $60.

The total cost is $100, and John brought $125. So, the amount he leaves with is $125 - $100 = $25.

The final answer is: $25"
"To find the price of the crate, we first need to determine the cost of each fruit. 

Since one banana costs twice as much as an apple, and one apple costs $0.5, the cost of one banana is 2 * $0.5 = $1.

Oranges cost three times as much as a banana, so the cost of one orange is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each type of fruit in a crate:
- Bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- Apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- Oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is the sum of the costs of all the fruits: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

The final answer is: $32"
"To find the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter, we need to calculate the total number of squares and multiply it by the area of each square, which is 1 square foot.

We know that there are 14 red squares. 
There are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so the number of blue squares is 14 + 4 = 18.
There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so the number of green squares is 18 + 6 = 24.
There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so the number of white squares is 24 - 12 = 12.

Now, let's add up the total number of squares: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68 squares.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find out how many chairs Mia needs, we first need to determine the total number of chairs she has. Since there are 8 high chairs and the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs by multiplying 8 by 5.

8 high chairs * 5 = 40 regular chairs

Now, we add the number of high chairs and regular chairs to get the total number of chairs.

8 high chairs + 40 regular chairs = 48 chairs

Since there will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending, we need to find out the total number of chairs required. Babies will use high chairs, so we add the number of adults and babies to get the total number of people.

42 adults + 15 babies = 57 people

Since each person needs a chair, we need 57 chairs in total. To find out how many more chairs Mia needs, we subtract the number of chairs she has from the total number of chairs required.

57 total chairs - 48 available chairs = 9 more chairs

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the number of 8-point bucks, we first need to find the total number of bucks in the field. Since 50% of the deer are bucks, we can calculate this as:

50% of 50 deer = 0.5 * 50 = 25 bucks

Next, we need to find the number of 8-point bucks. Since 20% of the bucks are 8-point, we can calculate this as:

20% of 25 bucks = 0.2 * 25 = 5

So, there are 5 8-point bucks in the field.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Adam has 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 
   To find Betty's points, we need to calculate 30% of Adam's points and add it to Adam's points.
   30% of 50 = 0.3 * 50 = 15
   Betty's points = Adam's points + 15 = 50 + 15 = 65
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty. 
   Tom's points = Betty's points - 30 = 65 - 30 = 35
4. Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom.
   Marta's points = 3 * Tom's points = 3 * 35 = 105

Now, let's calculate the total points collected by the class:
Total points = Adam's points + Betty's points + Tom's points + Marta's points
Total points = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the minimum threshold:
Points missing = Minimum threshold - Total points
Points missing = 400 - 255
Points missing = 145

The final answer is: 145"
"To find the total number of great-grandbabies, we need to start with the number of great-grandbabies each of Great Grandma Jones' children has, which is 3. Then, we need to multiply this number by the number of children of Great Grandma Jones, which is 3. 

So, the total number of great-grandbabies from the first generation of children is 3 * 3 = 9.

However, each of these 9 great-grandbabies also has 3 babies of their own, who are the second generation of great-grandbabies. To find the total number of second-generation great-grandbabies, we multiply the number of first-generation great-grandbabies by 3.

So, the total number of second-generation great-grandbabies is 9 * 3 = 27.

Therefore, the total number of great-grandbabies at the family reunion is 9 + 27 = 36.

"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we first need to find out how many fireworks the city will set off in total. 

The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks is 15 * 20 = 300.

Hannah's house is at the right angle to see 40% of the city's fireworks. To find 40% of 300, we multiply 300 by 0.4. 

0.4 * 300 = 120

Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard. So, the total number of fireworks she will set off is 3 * 5 = 15.

Now, we add the number of fireworks Hannah will see from the city and the number of fireworks she will set off in her backyard. 

120 + 15 = 135

"To find the total amount spent on snacks and drinks, we first need to determine the total number of people and the total number of items (drinks and snacks) they buy.

Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people. When they meet up with 7 more friends, the total number of people becomes 13 + 7 = 20.

Each person buys enough drinks and snacks to fill the seats, which means each person buys 2 drinks and 3 snacks. So, the total number of drinks and snacks bought is 20 * 2 (drinks) + 20 * 3 (snacks) = 40 drinks + 60 snacks = 100 items.

Since each item costs $2, the total amount spent on snacks and drinks is 100 items * $2 = $200.

"To find out how many pounds Gary's truck can carry, we first need to determine how much Gordy's truck can carry. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds, Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

Now, we know that the combined capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds. We already know that Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds and Gordy's truck can carry 4,800 pounds. To find out how much Gary's truck can carry, we subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity of all three trucks.

Gary's truck capacity = Total capacity - (Gissela's capacity + Gordy's capacity)
Gary's truck capacity = 11,600 - (4,000 + 4,800)
Gary's truck capacity = 11,600 - 8,800
Gary's truck capacity = 2,800

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many dumplings each male ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males in the group, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

There are 6 females in the group, and each female ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

The total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females is 32 + 18 = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the total number of dumplings eaten by the group, which is 50.

"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. 

Speed of the cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we can find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

"To find out how many hours they need to fundraise, we need to first determine how much they need to raise per hour to reach their goal. 

The total amount they need to raise is $6300, and they have already raised $2100 in 3 hours. 

The amount they need to raise in total is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

Since they need to raise $4200 in total and they have already raised $2100 in 3 hours, we can find the amount they need to raise per hour by dividing the remaining amount by the number of hours they have already worked.

$4200 / 3 hours = $1400 per hour.

Now, we can find the total number of hours they need to fundraise by dividing the total amount they need to raise by the amount they need to raise per hour.

$4200 / $1400 per hour = 3 hours.

However, this is the time they need to raise the remaining amount. Since they have already worked for 3 hours, we need to add this to the time they need to raise the remaining amount.

Total hours = 3 hours (already worked) + 3 hours (to raise the remaining amount) = 6 hours.

"To find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rate of each type of ice cream and then add them together.

The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. To find the production rate, we divide the total quarts by the time:

100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour (chocolate)

The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. To find the production rate, we divide the total quarts by the time:

50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour (vanilla)

Now, we need to find the total production in 48 hours for each type of ice cream:

Chocolate: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

- 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each: 4 x $2.50 = $10.00
- 3 mini quiches at $4.00 apiece: 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
- 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 apiece: 13 x $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Since Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off his purchase, we need to calculate the discount amount: 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many scoops Erin can buy with her $6.00. Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide the total amount of money Erin has by the cost of each scoop.

$6.00 ÷ $1.50 = 4

This means Erin can buy 4 scoops of ice cream. However, the deal is buy 2 scoops get 1 free, so we need to consider this when calculating the total number of scoops Erin can get.

If Erin buys 2 scoops, she will get 1 free, making it 3 scoops for the price of 2. If she buys 4 scoops, she will get 2 free, making it 6 scoops for the price of 4. Since Erin has $6.00, she can buy 4 scoops and get 2 free, which is the best deal for her.

So, Erin should buy 4 scoops of ice cream.

"To find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total amount of candy each of them eats in two weeks and subtract that from their initial amount.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56, so she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.

Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42, so she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

The difference in the amount of candy they have after two weeks is 58 - 44 = 14.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that there are 6 people in total (Bryce and his 5 friends). Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices is 6 * 12 = 72.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 3 people eating 2/3 of their pizzas, we can calculate the total number of slices they ate as follows:

(2/3) * (3 * 12) = (2/3) * 36 = 24 slices

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 people eating ¾ of their pizzas, we can calculate the total number of slices they ate as follows:

(3/4) * (2 * 12) = (3/4) * 24 = 18 slices

Now, let's add the slices eaten by both groups:

24 + 18 = 42 slices

To find the number of slices left, we subtract the total slices eaten from the total number of slices:

72 - 42 = 30 slices

So, there are 30 slices of pizza left.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages, we need to calculate 2/3 of the time it takes the cat. 

The cat eats the sausages in 30 minutes. 
2/3 of 30 minutes is (2/3) * 30 = 20 minutes.

So, the dog eats the sausages in 20 minutes.

To find the average time, we need to add the time taken by the cat and the dog and divide by 2.

Average time = (30 + 20) / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25 minutes.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe into inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet into inches by multiplying 8 by 12, which equals 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches to this gives us a total of 100 inches for the length of one of Topher's shoes.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. We can write the equation as:

100 = 9x + 10

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us:

90 = 9x

Dividing both sides of the equation by 9 gives us:

x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

"To find the total number of windows smashed by Hannah, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed from students' cars and teachers' cars separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of windows smashed from students' cars. There are 64 students' cars with 4 windows each. A quarter of the students' cars' windows are smashed, which is 1/4 * 64 * 4 = 16 windows.

Next, let's find the number of windows smashed from teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars with 2 windows each. Three-fourths of the teachers' cars' windows are smashed, which is 3/4 * 32 * 2 = 24 windows.

Now, let's add the number of windows smashed from students' cars and teachers' cars to get the total number of windows smashed by Hannah. 
16 + 24 = 40

"To find the total number of blue spools, we need to add the number of light blue and dark blue spools. 

Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

Next, we need to find the total number of spools. 

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

Now, we can find the percentage of blue spools by dividing the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00 and subtract that from the total number of people.

At 8:00, 2/5 of 5000 people had voted by midday. 
2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people voted by midday.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 
The number of people remaining after midday is 5000 - 2000 = 3000.
2/3 * 3000 = 2000 people voted by 16:00.

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is the total number of people minus the number of people who voted by 16:00.
5000 - (2000 + 2000) = 0 people had not voted by 16:00, however, this is incorrect as it is not possible for no one to have not voted. 

Let's recalculate the number of people who had not voted by 16:00. 
The number of people who had not voted by midday is 5000 - 2000 = 3000.
By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted, which means 1/3 of the remaining people had not voted.
1/3 * 3000 = 1000 people had not voted by 16:00.

"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will need for 30 days and then divide that by the number of pieces in a pack.

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. For 30 days, he will need 4 * 30 = 120 pieces of gum.

A pack of gum has 15 pieces. To find out how many packs he will need, we divide the total number of pieces needed by the number of pieces in a pack: 120 / 15 = 8.

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the total number of s'mores needed, we first need to calculate the total number of s'mores required for both kids and adults.

Kids want 2 s'mores each, and there are 9 kids. So, the total number of s'mores for kids is 9 * 2 = 18.

Adults will eat 1 s'more each, and there are 6 adults. So, the total number of s'mores for adults is 6 * 1 = 6.

The total number of s'mores needed is 18 (for kids) + 6 (for adults) = 24.

Each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 s'mores, and there are 3 sleeves in a box. So, each box can make 8 * 3 = 24 s'mores.

Since the total number of s'mores needed is 24, and each box can make 24 s'mores, they will need 1 box of graham crackers.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we first need to determine their individual ages.

Given that Dora is 15 years old, we can find her father's age by using the information that her father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 

Father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8
Father's age = 2 * 15 + 8
Father's age = 30 + 8
Father's age = 38

Next, we know that Dora's mother is four years younger than her father. 

Mother's age = Father's age - 4
Mother's age = 38 - 4
Mother's age = 34

Now that we have the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother, we can find the total combined age.

Total combined age = Dora's age + Father's age + Mother's age
Total combined age = 15 + 38 + 34
Total combined age = 87

The final answer is: 87"

"To find the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying, we need to calculate the weight of each book and add them up.

Cindy has 3 math and science books, so the total weight of these books is 3 * 2 = 6 pounds.

Her French book weighs 4 pounds and her English book weighs 3 pounds.

Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book, so it weighs 2 * 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all the books: 6 (math and science) + 4 (French) + 3 (English) + 6 (history) = 19 pounds.

The total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 19 pounds.

"To find out how many apples Beck has initially, we need to subtract 23 from Boris's total. 

Boris has 100 apples. 
Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. 
Beck now has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

Boris still has 100 apples. 
To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract Beck's total from Boris's total:

"Let's break down the information given:

- Total students = 50
- Students who like to bake = 10
- Students who like to play basketball = 5
- Students who like to play music = 2 * (students who like to play basketball) = 2 * 5 = 10

We know that the rest of the students like to either play video games or play music. So, the number of students who like to play video games or music = Total students - (students who like to bake + students who like to play basketball) 
= 50 - (10 + 5)

"To find the number of boys in each class, we first need to find the total number of girls in both classes. Since 40% of the students in each class are girls, and there are 80 students in total, we can set up an equation to find the number of students in each class.

Let x be the number of students in each class. Then, 2x = 80 (since there are two classes with the same number of students).

Solving for x, we get x = 80 / 2 = 40.

Now that we know there are 40 students in each class, we can find the number of girls in each class. 40% of 40 is 0.4 * 40 = 16 girls in each class.

Since there are 40 students in each class, and 16 are girls, the number of boys in each class is 40 - 16 = 24.

"To find out how much money the tomato vendor saves a week, we need to first calculate the daily savings and then multiply it by 7.

The vendor used to buy 500 tomatoes a day at $.5 each, so his daily cost was 500 * $.5 = $250.

With the new vendor, he buys the same 500 tomatoes at $.4 each, so his new daily cost is 500 * $.4 = $200.

The daily savings is the difference between the old cost and the new cost: $250 - $200 = $50.

To find the weekly savings, we multiply the daily savings by 7: $50 * 7 = $350.

"To find out how many groups are needed, we first need to determine the number of students per group. Since there are 54 students and they are to be separated into 6 groups of equal size, we divide the total number of students by the number of groups.

54 students / 6 groups = 9 students per group

Now, we know that the activity requires 12 groups. To find out how many more groups are needed, we need to divide the total number of groups required by the number of groups we already have, which is 6.

12 groups / 6 groups = 2

However, the question asks for the number of more groups needed, not the total number of groups. Since we already have 6 groups, we need to subtract the number of groups we already have from the total number of groups required.

12 groups - 6 groups = 6

So, 6 more groups are needed to form.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

First, she trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. 
Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons.

Now, she has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. 
Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

Now, she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. 
Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

"Let's break down the information given:

- The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250.
- The first house needs 1/2 of what the second house needs.
- The third house needs double what the first house needs.

Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as 'x'. Then, the first house needs x/2 cases, and the third house needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases.

Since the total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250, we can set up the equation:

x/2 + x + x = 250

Combine like terms:

(3x/2) = 250

Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

3x = 500

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 500/3
x = 166.67

Since x is the number of cases needed for the second house, the first house needs x/2 = 166.67/2 = 83.33 cases, and the third house needs x = 166.67 cases.

The third house needs 166.67 cases of shingles.

Now, let's add their costs together: $6 (Leila) + $5 (Jack) + $3 (Chase) = $14.

The final answer is: $14"
"To find the number of pears George has, we need to calculate 45% of the number of bananas and add it to the number of bananas. 

First, let's find 45% of 200 bananas:
45% of 200 = 0.45 * 200 = 90

Now, let's add this to the number of bananas:
200 (bananas) + 90 (additional pears) = 290

Since George has 45% more pears than bananas, we can say he has 290 pears. To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and pears:
200 (bananas) + 290 (pears) = 490

The final answer is: 490"
"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to subtract the cost of the ball from the amount of money she had initially. 

Marissa had $80 and spent $20 on the ball. 

$80 (initial money) - $20 (cost of the ball) = $60

Now, we need to find out how many candy bars she can buy with $60, given that each candy bar costs $5.

$60 (remaining money) / $5 (cost of each candy bar) = 12

So, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

12"
"To find out how much money Sam needs to spend, we first need to determine how many kilograms of oranges are required to make 4 liters of juice. Since Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges to make 1 liter of juice, we can multiply this by 4 to get the total kilograms needed for 4 liters.

5 kilograms/liter * 4 liters = 20 kilograms

Now, we know that each kilogram of oranges costs $3. To find the total cost, we multiply the total kilograms needed by the cost per kilogram.

20 kilograms * $3/kilogram = $60

So, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice.

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how many books Ahmed read, we need to divide the number of books Ezra read by 2, since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed. 

Ezra read 300 books, so Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Now, we need to add the 150 books Ezra decided to read to the total number of books they both read. 

Total books read by Ezra = 300 + 150 = 450 books
Total books read by Ahmed = 150 books

Total books read by both = 450 + 150 = 600 books

The final answer is: 600"
"To find out how much Tanya earned, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately and then add them together.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total earnings for the hours worked would be 5 hours * $15/hour = $75. Additionally, she earns $5 per day for teaching more than 3 classes, so she earns an extra $5 for Monday. Therefore, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her earnings for the hours worked would be 2 hours * $15/hour = $30. Since she teaches less than 3 classes, she doesn't earn the extra $5 per day. Therefore, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

Now, let's add her earnings for both days: $80 (Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) = $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"To find the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

The company sold 5 vanilla scents and there are 4 vanilla scents available, so the total number of vanilla scents sold is 5 * 4 = 20.

The company sold 2 fruity scents and there are 8 fruity scents available, so the total number of fruity scents sold is 2 * 8 = 16.

Now, we need to find the difference between the total number of vanilla scents sold and the total number of fruity scents sold. 

Difference = Total vanilla scents sold - Total fruity scents sold
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we first need to calculate how much money he makes from selling the eggplants. 

He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount he makes from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, and he already makes $60 from eggplants, he needs to make $135 - $60 = $75 from selling the corn.

He has 25 ears of corn, so to find out how much he should sell each ear for, we divide the total amount he needs to make from corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25). 

$75 / 25 = $3.

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total time Tatiana has available for soccer, video games, and reading, we need to add the hours she has on Saturday and Sunday. 

Total time available = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

She reads for 3 hours, so the remaining time for soccer and video games is:
Remaining time = Total time available - Time spent reading
Remaining time = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time:
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

Now, we can find the time spent playing soccer:
Time spent playing soccer = Remaining time - Time spent playing video games
Time spent playing soccer = 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we need to divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time available and multiply by 100:
Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (Time spent playing soccer / Total time available) * 100
Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps of the problem.

Initially, Anthony had 50 pencils.

He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon. 
1/2 of 50 is 50 * 1/2 = 25. 
So, Anthony gave 25 pencils to Brandon and was left with 50 - 25 = 25 pencils.

He then gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. 
3/5 of 25 is 25 * 3/5 = 15. 
So, Anthony gave 15 pencils to Charlie and was left with 25 - 15 = 10 pencils.

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to drive to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Jack to drive to the museum:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time = 2 hours

Since he drives to the museum and back, we need to multiply the time by 2:

Total driving time = 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours

Now, we add the time he spends at the museum to the total driving time:

Total time = Total driving time + Time at the museum
Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time = 10 hours

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many wheels Henry will need in total, we need to calculate the number of wheels required for the cars and the motorcycles separately and then add them together.

For the cars, Henry needs 4 wheels for each of the 57 cars. So, the total number of wheels required for the cars is 57 * 4 = 228.

For the motorcycles, Henry needs 2 wheels for each of the 73 motorcycles. So, the total number of wheels required for the motorcycles is 73 * 2 = 146.

Now, let's add the total number of wheels required for the cars and the motorcycles: 228 + 146 = 374.

Since Henry has a box with 650 wheels in it, we need to subtract the total number of wheels required from the total number of wheels available to find out how many wheels will be left. 

650 - 374 = 276

The final answer is: 276"
"To find the amount you have to pay after the discount, we need to calculate 20% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

20% of $1000 = 0.20 * $1000 = $200

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:
$1000 - $200 = $800

So, you have to pay $800 after the discount.

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we need to calculate the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the remaining movies.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. A third of the movies are in series, so the number of movies in series is 600 / 3 = 200.

The cost of the movies in series is 200 * $6 = $1200.

Next, let's find the number of older movies. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies. The remaining movies are 600 - 200 = 400. 40% of 400 is 0.4 * 400 = 160. So, the number of older movies is 160.

The cost of the older movies is 160 * $5 = $800.

Now, let's find the number of remaining movies. We already know that 200 movies are in series and 160 are older movies. So, the number of remaining movies is 600 - 200 - 160 = 240.

The cost of the remaining movies is 240 * $10 = $2400.

The total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection is $1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400.

The final answer is: $4400"
"To find the total amount Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

The cost of peaches is 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00
The cost of plums is 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00
The cost of apricots is 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, let's add the costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

The final answer is: $38.00"
"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we first need to find the total time spent driving and hiking. They drove for 6 hours and hiked for 1.5 hours, so the total time is 6 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours.

The average speed while driving is given as 50 miles per hour. 

The average speed while hiking is 5 miles per hour less than half their speed when they drive. Half of 50 is 25, and 5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, we can find the distance covered while driving and hiking. The distance covered while driving is speed * time = 50 * 6 = 300 miles. The distance covered while hiking is speed * time = 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

The total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance covered while driving and hiking, which is 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

The final answer is: 330"
"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the points each of them gets from enemies, berries, and the timer.

Let's assume Emma's score from enemies is x. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava's score from enemies will be x + 8.

Emma collects 3 fewer berries than Ava, so let's assume Ava collects y berries. Emma collects y - 3 berries.

The time difference is 4 seconds, and Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower. This means Emma finishes the level 4 seconds earlier. Since Ava gets 30 points for every second left on the timer, Emma gets 30 points more than Ava for the timer.

Let's denote Emma's time as t seconds. Then Ava's time is t + 4 seconds. The points Emma gets from the timer is 30t, and the points Ava gets from the timer is 30(t + 4).

Now, let's calculate the total score for each of them:

Emma's total score = (x points from enemies) + (5 * (y - 3) points from berries) + (30t points from timer)
= x + 5y - 15 + 30t

Ava's total score = (x + 8 points from enemies) + (5y points from berries) + 30(t + 4) points from timer
= x + 8 + 5y + 30t + 120

Now, we need to find the difference between their scores. We know that Emma gets 30 points more than Ava for the timer, so we can write an equation:

30t - (30t + 120) = 30
-120 = 30
This equation is not correct, we need to use the fact that Emma finishes the level 4 seconds earlier, so Ava gets 30 points less than Emma for the timer. The correct equation is:

"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that are already known. Since two pizzas cost 30 dollars each, the total cost of these two pizzas is 2 * 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract this amount from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the total cost of the other two pizzas. The total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars, so the total cost of the other two pizzas is 64 - 60 = 4 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can find the cost of each pizza by dividing the total cost of the other two pizzas by 2. The cost of each of the other two pizzas is 4 / 2 = 2 dollars.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Chase and Rider ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days, which is a total of 3 * 5 = 15 times.

On the two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which means they ride 2 * 3 = 6 times each day.

So, for the two special days, they ride a total of 6 * 2 = 12 times.

Now, let's add the total number of times they ride on the usual days (15) and the special days (12) to get the total number of times they ride in a week.

15 + 12 = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"Let's break down the information given:

Initially, Bob had 7 fish in his pond, with 3 orange and 4 white.

After buying more fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's denote the number of white fish he bought as 'x'. The number of orange fish he bought would then be 2x (since he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish).

The total number of fish in the pond after buying more fish is 7 (initial fish) + 17 (new fish) = 24.

The total number of white fish after buying more fish is 4 (initial white fish) + x (new white fish).

The total number of orange fish after buying more fish is 3 (initial orange fish) + 2x (new orange fish).

Since the total number of fish is 24, we can set up the equation:

4 + x + 3 + 2x = 24

Combine like terms:

3x + 7 = 24

Subtract 7 from both sides:

3x = 17

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 17/3

x is not a whole number, but since we're dealing with the number of fish, it must be a whole number. This means our initial assumption that the number of white fish he bought is 'x' might not be correct.

However, we can try to find the closest whole number to 17/3, which is 5.67. The closest whole number to 5.67 is 6.

Let's check if this works:

"To calculate the weekly fuel consumption, we need to first calculate the daily fuel consumption. 

The one-way distance between home and office is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 5 * 2 = 10 miles. 

Since Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, he drives 10 miles * 5 days = 50 miles per week.

Given that Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, we can calculate the weekly fuel consumption in gallons as follows:

Weekly fuel consumption (gallons) = Total weekly miles / Fuel efficiency (MPG)
= 50 miles / 10 MPG
= 5 gallons

Now, we can calculate the weekly fuel cost by multiplying the weekly fuel consumption by the price of gas:

Weekly fuel cost = Weekly fuel consumption (gallons) * Price per gallon
= 5 gallons * $3/gallon
= $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Carrie had initially and then subtract the amount she spent.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie had initially. She was given 10 twenties and 140 quarters.

The value of 10 twenties is 10 x $20 = $200.
The value of 140 quarters is 140 x $0.25 = $35.

So, the total amount of money Carrie had initially is $200 + $35 = $235.

Carrie spent all the quarters, which is $35, and 3/5 of the twenties, which is 3/5 x $200 = $120.

The total amount she spent is $35 + $120 = $155.

Therefore, the total amount of money she paid for lunch is $155.

"To find out how much money John is missing, we first need to determine how much the school will cover. Since the school is covering half the cost of the trip, we can calculate this as:

Total cost of the trip = $300
School's contribution = Total cost / 2
School's contribution = $300 / 2
School's contribution = $150

Now, we know that John has $50 and the school is covering $150, so the total amount covered is $150 + $50 = $200.

To find out how much John is missing, we subtract the total amount covered from the total cost of the trip:

Amount John is missing = Total cost of the trip - Total amount covered
Amount John is missing = $300 - $200
Amount John is missing = $100

"To solve this problem, we need to find out the temperature at night and then calculate how many logs Carson needs to burn to bring the temperature up to 32 degrees.

First, let's find the temperature at night. It's 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the day, and the day temperature is 45 degrees. 

Night temperature = Day temperature - 33
Night temperature = 45 - 33
Night temperature = 12 degrees

Since the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, Carson needs to bring the temperature up from 12 degrees to 32 degrees. 

Temperature to be raised = 32 - 12
Temperature to be raised = 20 degrees

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we divide the temperature to be raised by the temperature each log heats up.

Number of logs = Temperature to be raised / Temperature per log
Number of logs = 20 / 5
Number of logs = 4

"To find the total number of seashells brought back, we first need to find the number of groups formed and then the number of groups that brought back seashells.

First, let's find the number of groups formed. Since 90 people were split into 9-person groups, we can divide 90 by 9 to get the number of groups:

90 / 9 = 10

Now, we know that 3/5 of the groups brought back seashells. To find the number of groups that brought back seashells, we multiply the total number of groups by 3/5:

10 * (3/5) = 6

So, 6 groups brought back seashells. Each of these groups brought back 2 seashells, so we multiply the number of groups by 2:

6 * 2 = 12

Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is 12.

"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we first need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans. 

The original price of the jeans is $40, and they are 25% off. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (25% or 0.25).

Discount = Original Price * Discount Percentage
Discount = $40 * 0.25
Discount = $10

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price.

Discounted Price = Original Price - Discount
Discounted Price = $40 - $10
Discounted Price = $30

Since Mike pays with a $50 bill, we subtract the discounted price from the $50 bill to find out how much money he will have left over.

Money Left Over = $50 - $30
Money Left Over = $20

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first find the total number of employees after three months. 

The company initially has 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. So, after one month, the total number of employees will be 200 + 20 = 220. 
After two months, the total number of employees will be 220 + 20 = 240. 
After three months, the total number of employees will be 240 + 20 = 260.

Now, we need to calculate the total salary paid to all employees after three months. Each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month. So, the total salary paid to all employees after three months will be the total number of employees multiplied by the monthly salary of each employee, multiplied by the number of months.

"To find the total time the choir will be caroling, we need to add the time it takes to sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice and the time it takes to sing ""Jingle Bells"" once.

First, let's calculate the total time for ""Deck the Halls"": 2 songs * 150 seconds/song = 300 seconds.

Next, let's add the time for ""Jingle Bells"": 300 seconds + 240 seconds = 540 seconds.

The choir will be caroling for 540 seconds.

"To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we first need to calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours.

Billy's initial hourly wage was $10. After 2 months, he got a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new hourly wage $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. After another year, he got a raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final hourly wage $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Billy's total earnings for 20 hours of work at $11.50 per hour is 20 * $11.50 = $230.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, which was $10. So, Sally's starting salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. 

Sally's total earnings for 20 hours of work at $10.50 per hour is 20 * $10.50 = $210.

The difference in their earnings is $230 - $210 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To find the difference in cost between 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels, we first need to calculate the total cost of each item.

The cost of 3 loaves of bread is 3 x $2 = $6.

The cost of 2 bagels is 2 x $1 = $2.

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two. 

$6 (cost of 3 loaves of bread) - $2 (cost of 2 bagels) = $4.

"To find Nikita's score, we need to calculate half of Pierson's score and then add 11. 

Pierson's score is 278. Half of 278 is 278 / 2 = 139. 
Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score, so Nikita's score is 139 + 11 = 150.

Now, we need to find the total score of Pierson and Nikita. 
Pierson's score is 278 and Nikita's score is 150. 
Total score = Pierson's score + Nikita's score = 278 + 150 = 428.

The final answer is: 428"
"To find the total number of trees planted by the students, we need to calculate the total number of students and multiply it by 1 (since each student plants 1 tree). 

Total number of students = 40 classes * 25 students per class = 1000 students

Total number of trees planted by students = 1000 students * 1 tree per student = 1000 trees

To find the total number of trees planted by the teachers, we need to calculate the total number of teachers and multiply it by 2 (since each teacher plants 2 trees).

Total number of teachers = 40 classes * 3 teachers per class = 120 teachers

Total number of trees planted by teachers = 120 teachers * 2 trees per teacher = 240 trees

Total number of trees planted = Total number of trees planted by students + Total number of trees planted by teachers

"To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. 

30% of 14 = 0.3 * 14 = 4.2

Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we'll consider the context of the problem. If Bubbles buys 5 stuffed goats, the percentage of stuffed goats will be 5/19, which is approximately 26.32%. Since 5 stuffed goats is less than 30%, she needs to buy more. 

Let's calculate the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy to get 30% of the total number of stuffed animals.

Let x be the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. 

The total number of stuffed animals after buying x goats will be 14 + x.

The percentage of stuffed goats will be (5 + x) / (14 + x) = 0.3

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

5 + x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side:

5 + x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides:

5 + 0.7x = 4.2

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

0.7x = -0.8

Dividing both sides by 0.7:

x = -1.14

Since we can't buy a negative number of stuffed animals, this solution is not valid. We need to re-evaluate our approach.

Let's try a different method. We know that the number of stuffed goats should be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. We can set up an equation:

(5 + x) / (14 + x) = 0.3

Cross-multiplying:

5 + x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side:

5 + x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides:

5 + 0.7x = 4.2

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

0.7x = -0.8

x = -1.14

"To find out how many hours Kris has played, we first need to calculate the total hours she played in the first 2 weeks and the additional week.

In 2 weeks, there are 14 days. If Kris plays for half an hour every day, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in the first 2 weeks.

In the additional week, she plays for 2 hours every day, so she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in the additional week.

Total hours played so far is 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours. So, the hours she still needs to play is 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time.

The first car travels at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 70 miles/hour x 2 hours = 140 miles

Since the second car was initially passing the first car, we need to find the distance between them after 2 hours. The second car has traveled 140 miles, and the first car has traveled 120 miles. The distance between them is the difference between the two distances:
Distance = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice the fourth-graders', so it's 2 * 40 = 80 out of 100 passed

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed:
340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 80 (fifth-graders) = 460 students passed

Next, let's calculate the total number of students in the school:
500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000 students

"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we first need to determine how many square inches of mosaic he can make with the glass chips he has. 

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, and each bag holds 72 chips, we can calculate the total number of chips Milo has: 2 bags * 72 chips per bag = 144 chips.

Now, we need to find out how many square inches of mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch, we divide the total number of chips by 12: 144 chips / 12 chips per square inch = 12 square inches.

Since the mosaic is three inches tall, and we know the area of the mosaic (12 square inches), we can find the length by dividing the area by the height: 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches.

So, Milo can make a mosaic that is 4 inches long.

"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount of tea each group of students drank and add them together.

16 students drank 2 quarts each, so the total amount of tea they drank is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we know that 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts. So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party in gallons is 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we first need to determine the total number of candies he has. 

Initially, Dale had 100 candies. He sold 150, so he was left with 100 - 150 = -50 candies. However, this is not possible since you can't have a negative number of candies. This means he must have sold more than he had initially. 

Let's recalculate: Dale initially had 100 candies, but he sold 150, which is more than he had. This means he must have had some candies left from the initial order and then ordered more. 

Let's assume he had x candies left from the initial order. Then, he sold 150 candies and had x candies left. After that, he ordered 100 more. So, the total number of candies he has now is x + 100. 

Since he initially had 100 candies, the number of candies he sold is 150. This means that the number of candies he had left after selling 150 is 100 - 150 = -50, but we know that he ordered 100 more after that. This means that the number of candies he had left after selling 150 is actually 100 - 150 + 100 = 50. 

So, the number of candies he has now is 50 + 100 = 150. 

Now, to find out how many candies he still needs to sell, we subtract the number of candies he has from the total number of candies he has ordered. 

Total number of candies he has ordered = 100 (initial order) + 100 (additional order) = 200. 

Number of candies he still needs to sell = Total number of candies he has ordered - Number of candies he has = 200 - 150 = 50.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of each month and then subtract the initial number of students from it.

At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students.

- At the end of January, the number of students doubles, so there are 10 * 2 = 20 students.
- At the end of February, the number of students doubles again, so there are 20 * 2 = 40 students.
- At the end of March, the number of students doubles again, so there are 40 * 2 = 80 students.
- At the end of April, the number of students doubles again, so there are 80 * 2 = 160 students.
- At the end of May, the number of students doubles again, so there are 160 * 2 = 320 students.

Now, let's subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May to find the additional students: 320 - 10 = 310.

- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, we need to subtract 4 petals (1 from each set) from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

The total number of petals in the vase is 97."
"To find out how many marshmallows are left in the bag, we need to subtract the total number of marshmallows used and the ones dropped from the initial number of marshmallows.

Initially, there were 35 marshmallows. John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores, so together they made 18 S'mores. They also dropped 3 marshmallows. 

Total marshmallows used = 18 (from S'mores) + 3 (dropped) = 21 marshmallows

Marshmallows left = 35 (initial) - 21 (used) = 14 marshmallows

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the number of S'mores they can make with the remaining marshmallows is equal to the number of marshmallows left.

Each kid can have 7 S'mores (14 marshmallows / 2 kids).

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person plays and then determine how many quarters they use.

Jack can play for 20 minutes. His two friends who are worse can play for half as long, which is 20 / 2 = 10 minutes. The friend who is better can play for 1.5 times as long, which is 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes.

Since they play for 4 hours, we need to convert this to minutes. 4 hours is equal to 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total time each person plays:

- Jack: 240 minutes
- Two worse friends: 2 * 10 minutes = 20 minutes each, so 2 * 20 = 40 minutes total
- Better friend: 240 minutes

Now, let's calculate how many quarters each person uses:

- Jack: 240 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 12 quarters
- Two worse friends: 40 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 2 quarters each, so 2 * 2 = 4 quarters total
- Better friend: 240 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 12 quarters

Now, let's calculate the total number of quarters used:

12 (Jack) + 4 (worse friends) + 12 (better friend) = 28 quarters

Since each quarter costs $0.25, the total amount of money used is:

28 quarters * $0.25 = $7

The final answer is: $7"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as Z, fragrance as F, salt as S, sugar as Su, and oil as O. 

We know that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so F = Z. 
She uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so S = Su. 
She uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S. 
She also uses twice as much salt as zest, so S = 2Z.

Since F = Z, we can substitute F with Z in the equation S = 2Z, so S = 2Z and Su = 2Z as well.

Now we have O = 2S and S = 2Z. We can substitute S with 2Z in the equation O = 2S, so O = 2(2Z) = 4Z.

We know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, and it's a combination of Z, F, S, Su, and O. Since F = Z and S = Su = 2Z, we can write the total amount as Z + Z + 2Z + 2Z + 4Z = 10.

Combine like terms: 10Z = 10.

Divide both sides by 10: Z = 1.

Now that we know Z = 1, we can find O. Since O = 4Z, O = 4(1) = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of the goats is 3 * $500 = $1500.
The cost of the cows is 2 * $1500 = $3000.

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows to find the total amount spent: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Total cupcakes needed = 63
Cupcakes already available = 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48

Now, let's subtract the available cupcakes from the total needed:
63 - 48 = 15

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2. 
   40 * 0.2 = 8 cars sold.

3. Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

4. Now, let's calculate the total number of cars Joe gave away or sold. 
   Total given away or sold = 8 (sold) + 16 (given away) = 24 cars.

5. To find the number of cars Joe remains with, we subtract the total number of cars given away or sold from his initial number of cars.
   Cars remaining = 40 (initial) - 24 (given away or sold) = 16 cars.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to first determine the total amount raised by the students. Since the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, the amount raised by the students is $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Now, we know that there are 20 students and they all earn the same amount. To find out how much each student raised, we divide the total amount raised by the number of students: $125,000 / 20 = $6,250.

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time, we add the time walked on both days: 8 hours + 4 hours = 12 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply the total hours by 60 to convert it to minutes: 12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes.

The final answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we first need to determine the total number of cars in the parking lot after the first break. Initially, there were 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars after the first break is 50 + 20 = 70.

When Hunter got out of class for the lunch break, he realized that 1/2 the number of cars in the parking lot had gone. This means that 1/2 of 70 cars left, and the remaining 1/2 stayed. To find the number of cars that left, we multiply 70 by 1/2, which is 35. 

So, the number of cars that left is 35. To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars after the first break. The total number of cars after the first break is 70, and the number of cars that left is 35. 

70 - 35 = 35

The total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35."
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 different tasks. So, the total number of tasks he completes in a day is:
30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day

Since each task pays $1.20, the total amount John makes in a day is:
150 tasks/day * $1.20/task = $180/day

John works a full 7-day week, so the total amount he makes in a week is:
$180/day * 7 days = $1260

The final answer is: $1260"
"To find the total points scored by Sasha, we need to calculate her points in both games. 

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game. 

So, in the second game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points.

The total points scored by Sasha in both games is 14 + 4 = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total number of tins of cat food, we multiply the number of packages of cat food by the number of tins per package: 8 * 11 = 88.

To find the total number of tins of dog food, we multiply the number of packages of dog food by the number of tins per package: 6 * 6 = 36.

Now, we need to find the difference between the total number of tins of cat food and dog food: 88 - 36 = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as 'x'. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. We can write the equation as x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341.

Combine like terms: 7x + 12 = 341.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329.

Divide both sides by 7: x = 47.

Since PJ has x cards, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has 3x cards, so Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards. Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has 3 * 47 + 12 = 147 cards.

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs and then add them up.

Cindy had 5 green eggs. 
She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.
She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs of each color: 
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and subtract the refund amount from the purchase price.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The book weighs 4 pounds and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound, so the weight-based shipping cost is 4 * $0.35 = $1.40. The book needs to be returned 20 miles away, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile, so the distance-based shipping cost is 20 * $0.08 = $1.60. The total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $2.99.

Now, let's calculate the refund amount. Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price, which is 0.75 * $32 = $24.

The total cost of shipping is $2.99, and the refund amount is $24. To find out how much Milly will lose, we subtract the refund amount from the shipping cost: $2.99 - $24 = -$21.91. However, since we can't lose a negative amount of money, we need to recalculate the refund amount as the difference between the shipping cost and the refund amount. 

The correct calculation is: $2.99 - $24 = -$21.01. However, since we can't lose a negative amount of money, we need to recalculate the refund amount as the difference between the shipping cost and the refund amount.

"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she spent and subtract it from the initial amount she had, including the money her father gave her.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Mulan had initially: $40 (initial money) + $100 (money from her father) = $140.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money she spent: 2 pairs of jeans at $30 each = 2 x $30 = $60, and a bag for $20. So, the total amount spent is $60 + $20 = $80.

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $140 - $80 = $60.

So, Mulan has $60 left.

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for the first three weeks and then determine the pattern.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.
In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, we can find out how much he produces in the fourth week by subtracting the production of the first three weeks from the total monthly production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

The final answer is: 14,000"
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on TikTok in a week and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the time she spends on TikTok in a week:

- Time spent on writing amateur songs: 2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes
- Time spent on makeup: 15 minutes * 6 days = 90 minutes
- Time spent on recording videos: 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes

Total time spent on TikTok in a week = 120 + 90 + 72 = 282 minutes

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly time by 4:
282 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1128 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
1128 minutes / 60 = 18.8 hours

The final answer is: 18.8"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. The cost of the initial installation is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. However, the initial installation already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier. So, we need to subtract these from the total number of items she has.

Additional mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2
Additional chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1
Additional pictures: 20 - 10 = 10

The cost of the additional items is $15.00 per item. So, the total cost of the additional items is:
2 (mirrors) * $15.00 = $30.00
1 (chandelier) * $15.00 = $15.00
10 (pictures) * $15.00 = $150.00

Total cost of additional items: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

Now, we add the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items:
$129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00

The total cost for Angela will be $324.00.

The final answer is: $324.00"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Eva has saved $20.00.
2. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.
3. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply $30.00 by 0.4: $30.00 * 0.4 = $12.00.
4. To find the total amount Roy has saved, we add the 40% more to Anthony's savings: $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

The final answer is: $42.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many times higher Naruto can lift a mountain compared to Pompei. 

First, we know that Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. Since Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches.

Next, we know that Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. So, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Then, we know that Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. So, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). 

480 / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total distance traveled by Mason, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours, and then add them together.

Distance = Speed x Time

For the first 4 hours:
Distance = 8 miles/hour x 4 hours = 32 miles

For the next 6 hours:
Distance = 8 miles/hour x 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the time it takes for one kangaroo to travel across the highway. Since three kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, one kangaroo would take 18 hours multiplied by 3, which equals 54 hours.

Now, we know that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. This means that the time it takes for a turtle to travel across the highway will be twice the time it takes for a kangaroo to do so. 

Since one kangaroo takes 54 hours, one turtle will take 54 hours multiplied by 2, which equals 108 hours. 

However, we are asked about four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. Since the time it takes for one turtle is 108 hours, four turtles will take 108 hours multiplied by 4, which equals 432 hours.

The final answer is: 432"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Kora made 20 dishes. 
Rory made 20 more clay dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes. 
Jada made twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

To find the total number of clay dishes they all made together, we need to add the number of dishes made by each of them. 
Total = Kora's dishes + Rory's dishes + Jada's dishes 
Total = 20 + 40 + 80 
Total = 140

The final answer is: 140"
"Let's break down the information given. Erika's goal is to buy a laptop that costs $600. She gets a discount of $200 for trading in her old laptop, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.

She already has some savings in her purse, let's call it x. She also earned $150 from her part-time job and received $80 from her mom. So, the total amount she has is x + $150 + $80.

We know that after getting this total amount, she only needs $50 more to buy the laptop. This means the total amount she has is $400 (the price of the laptop after the discount) + $50 (the amount she still needs) = $450.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the situation: x + $150 + $80 = $450. 

Simplifying the equation, we get x + $230 = $450.

Subtracting $230 from both sides, we get x = $220.

So, Erika has $220 in her purse. 

The final answer is: $220"
"To find out how many slices Adam has left, we first need to calculate the total number of slices he has. 

3 large apples can be sliced into 3 * 5 = 15 slices. 
5 small apples can be sliced into 5 * 3 = 15 slices. 

So, in total, Adam has 15 + 15 = 30 slices. 

Since Adam eats 15 slices, we subtract the number of slices he ate from the total number of slices: 
30 - 15 = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the total amount of milk the farmer currently produces. 

The farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each cow, and he has 3 cows. So, the total amount of milk he currently produces is 5 liters/cow * 3 cows = 15 liters/day.

Now, we need to find out how many more cows he needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To do this, we subtract the current milk production from the target milk production: 25 liters/day - 15 liters/day = 10 liters/day.

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we need to find out how many cows are required to produce 10 liters of milk a day. We can do this by dividing the required milk production by the milk production per cow: 10 liters/day / 5 liters/cow = 2 cows.

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and add them together.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, which means 1/6 of the original length is unused. Since the original length is 12 mm, the unused portion is (1/6) * 12 = 2 mm.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, which means 2/3 of the original length is unused. Since the original length is 12 mm, the unused portion is (2/3) * 12 = 8 mm.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, which means 1/2 of the original length is unused. Since the original length is 12 mm, the unused portion is (1/2) * 12 = 6 mm.

Now, let's add the unused portions together: 2 mm + 8 mm + 6 mm = 16 mm.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 mm."
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy and subtract the amount of money he already has.

The total cost of the items is $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10080.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200, so he has a total of $5000 + $200 = $5200.

Now, let's subtract the amount of money Gabriel has from the total cost of the items: $10080 - $5200 = $3580.

So, Gabriel still needs $3580."
"To find the change, we need to calculate the total amount Thea paid and subtract the cost of the hat from it. 

Thea gave the craftsman four $20 bills, which is 4 x $20 = $80.

"To find out how much money Craig has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract that from the initial amount he had.

Craig initially had 2 twenty-dollar bills, which is 2 * $20 = $40.

He bought 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so the total cost of the squirt guns is 6 * $2 = $12.

He also bought 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so the total cost of the water balloons is 3 * $3 = $9.

The total amount he spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount he had: $40 - $21 = $19.

So, Craig has $19 left.

The final answer is: $19"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so the number of socks Jack has is 60 / 2 = 30.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 2 * 30 = 60 socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90
Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 90 + 90 = 180."
"To find the number of students good at math, we need to consider the total number of students and the number of students good at both subjects. 

Let's denote the number of students good at both math and English as 'x'. We know that the total number of students is 20, and the number of students good at math only is 5, and the number of students good at English only is 8.

We can set up the equation: 5 (math only) + 8 (English only) + x (both) = 20 (total)

Simplifying the equation, we get: 13 + x = 20

Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get: x = 7

This means that 7 students are good at both math and English. To find the total number of students good at math, we need to add the number of students good at math only (5) and the number of students good at both subjects (7).

Total number of students good at math = 5 (math only) + 7 (both) = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many groups can perform, we need to calculate the total available time for performances. The concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes. Subtracting the 10-minute intermission, we have 120 - 10 = 110 minutes left for performances.

Each group takes 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage, which totals 10 minutes per group. 

Now, we can divide the total available time for performances (110 minutes) by the time each group takes (10 minutes) to find out how many groups can perform: 110 / 10 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand that it's a simple interest scenario. The interest rate is 3/4 of the original amount, which can be expressed as 0.75 or 75% of the principal amount.

The formula for simple interest is: A = P(1 + rt), where A is the total amount, P is the principal amount, r is the interest rate, and t is the time period in years.

Given that the principal amount (P) is $300, the interest rate (r) is 0.75, and the time period (t) is 3 years, we can plug these values into the formula:

A = 300(1 + 0.75*3)
A = 300(1 + 2.25)
A = 300(3.25)
A = 975

So, after 3 years, Brenda will have a total of $975.

The final answer is: $975"
"To find the number of white shirts with no collars, we need to find the total number of white shirts and divide it by 2 since half of them have collars. 

Total white shirts = 40
White shirts with collars = 40 / 2 = 20
White shirts with no collars = 40 - 20 = 20

To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we need to find the total number of floral shirts and subtract the number of floral shirts with buttons.

Total floral shirts = 50
Floral shirts with buttons = 20
Floral shirts with no buttons = 50 - 20 = 30

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars.

Difference = Floral shirts with no buttons - White shirts with no collars
= 30 - 20
= 10

"To find out how much the farmer will earn, we need to determine how many trays he can fill with 900 eggs. 

Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray to find the number of trays.

Number of trays = Total eggs / Eggs per tray
= 900 / 30
= 30 trays

Now, we know the farmer has 30 trays and each tray is sold for $2.5. To find the total earnings, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray.

Total earnings = Number of trays * Price per tray
= 30 * $2.5
= $75

From Farm X, Mr. Smith sold 10 goats. 
From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as from Farm X, which is 2 * 10 = 20 goats.

Now, let's calculate the number of goats left in each farm:
- Farm X: 55 - 10 = 45 goats
- Farm Y: 45 - 20 = 25 goats

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the number of goats in Farm X and Farm Y:

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $18 = $54.

The total cost before discount is $75 + $54 = $129.

Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, the total discount is 3 * $2 = $6.

The total cost after discount is $129 - $6 = $123.

The final numerical answer is: $123"
"To find the time it takes to clean one-half of the rooms, we first need to determine the number of rooms that is half of 90. 

90 / 2 = 45 rooms

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room.

45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

"Let's break down the information given:

1. I am three years younger than my brother, so if my age is x, my brother's age is x + 3.
2. I am 2 years older than my sister, so my sister's age is x - 2.
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so my mom's age is 3(x + 3) - 1.
4. When you add all our ages, you get 87: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 
x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87
Combine like terms again: 
6x + 9 = 87

Subtract 9 from both sides: 
6x = 78

Divide both sides by 6: 
x = 13

So, I am 13 years old.

"To find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of glue sticks required. Since each student needs 2 glue sticks and there are 27 students, the total number of glue sticks needed is 27 * 2 = 54.

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by the number of glue sticks per pack to find out how many packs are needed. However, since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and expects to have some extra glue sticks left over, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

To do this, we can divide 54 by 8, which gives us 6.75. Since we can't buy a fraction of a pack, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 7.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at the given point over the three days.

On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point over the three days, we need to add the amounts of water passing through the river each day.

Total amount of water = 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000 gallons.

The final answer is: 24000"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. Since each infected person infects six others, we can model the growth of the infected population using a geometric progression.

Let's denote the initial number of infected people as P0 = 10. The number of new infections each day can be calculated as 6 times the number of infected people from the previous day.

Day 1: P1 = P0 + 6P0 = 10 + 6(10) = 10 + 60 = 70
Day 2: P2 = P1 + 6P1 = 70 + 6(70) = 70 + 420 = 490
Day 3: P3 = P2 + 6P2 = 490 + 6(490) = 490 + 2940 = 3430

So, after three days, the total number of people infected is 3430.

The final answer is: 3430"

Rafaela received 40 * $20 = $800 in tips. 

10% of $800 is 0.1 * $800 = $80. 

So, Julieta received $800 - $80 = $720 in tips.

Now, to find the total amount of money they received altogether, we add Rafaela's and Julieta's tips: $800 + $720 = $1520.

"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we first need to calculate the total number of oranges given to her children. 

She gave her 3 daughters 2 oranges each, so the total number of oranges given to her daughters is 3 * 2 = 6 oranges. 

Her son received 3 oranges. 

So, the total number of oranges given to her children is 6 (to daughters) + 3 (to son) = 9 oranges.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges initially. To find out how many oranges she remained with, we subtract the total number of oranges given to her children from the initial number of oranges. 

12 (initial oranges) - 9 (oranges given to children) = 3 oranges.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Claire earns 1 badge per month.
- Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.
- Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), the number of badges earned by each girl would be:

- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 0.5 badges/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:

36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

"To find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we first need to determine the number of silver coins she has. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, and she has 70 gold coins, we can set up an equation to find the number of silver coins.

Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'. We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 70

To solve for 'x', we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

x = 70 - 30
x = 40

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. To find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and silver coins:

Total coins = Number of gold coins + Number of silver coins
Total coins = 70 + 40
Total coins = 110

"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we first need to calculate the total number of burritos given to the students. 

There were 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Mr. George ate 20 burritos. 

Now, we need to find the total number of burritos ordered minus the number of burritos given to the students and the number eaten by Mr. George. 

Total burritos ordered = 600
Burritos given to students = 500
Burritos eaten by Mr. George = 20

Total leftover burritos = Total burritos ordered - (Burritos given to students + Burritos eaten by Mr. George)
Total leftover burritos = 600 - (500 + 20)
Total leftover burritos = 600 - 520
Total leftover burritos = 80

"To find the number of yellow cars, we first need to determine the number of green and blue cars. 

We know there are 12 red cars. The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we know the total number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52.

Since the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S.

We know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so we can write an equation: S = A + 25.

We also know that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so we can write another equation: A = F - 12.

We are also given that together, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books, so we can write the equation: S + A + F = 85.

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the third equation: (A + 25) + A + F = 85.

Combine like terms: 2A + F + 25 = 85.

Subtract 25 from both sides: 2A + F = 60.

Now, substitute the second equation into this one: 2(F - 12) + F = 60.

Expand the equation: 2F - 24 + F = 60.

Combine like terms: 3F - 24 = 60.

Add 24 to both sides: 3F = 84.

Divide both sides by 3: F = 28.

Since one 3-ounce box of Jello makes 10 small Jello cups, we need to find out how many boxes of Jello Greg needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total number of Jello cups needed by the number of Jello cups one box makes: 120 / 10 = 12.

Now that we know Greg needs 12 boxes of Jello, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of boxes by the cost per box: 12 * $1.25 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total cost of the phones, we multiply the number of phones by the cost per phone: 5 phones * $700/phone = $3500.

The seller gives the electronics seller $4000 in dollar bills. To find the change, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given: $4000 - $3500 = $500.

The seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to find out how much Keenan spends in a month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

First, let's find out how much Keenan pays in a month: 
40% of $400 = 0.4 * $400 = $160

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can find out how much Keenan spends per week by dividing the monthly cost by 4:
$160 / 4 = $40

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he ate on each day and add them up.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and divide by 5: (60 * 2) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. First, we need to find out how many pieces were left after the first two days. We subtract the pieces eaten on the first and second days from the total: 60 - 24 - 10 = 26. Then, we find 7/13 of 26: (26 * 7) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14.

Now, we add up the pieces eaten on each day: 24 + 10 + 14 = 48.

So, Tobias has eaten 48 pieces so far.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we first need to find the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water.

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so the cost of one bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

The cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the cost of one bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, we can find the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water by multiplying the cost of one bottle of soda by 3 and the cost of one bottle of water by 2, then adding the results together.

Cost of 3 bottles of soda = 3 * $3.00 = $9.00
Cost of 2 bottles of water = 2 * $2.00 = $4.00
Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

The final answer is: $13.00"
"To find out how much money David has left after buying the bolts, we need to calculate the total cost of the bolts and subtract that from the initial amount of money he has.

The cost of each bolt is $0.03, and David wants to buy 16 bolts. 

Total cost of bolts = Number of bolts * Cost per bolt
Total cost of bolts = 16 * $0.03
Total cost of bolts = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost of the bolts from the initial amount of money David has:

Initial amount of money = $12.48
Total cost of bolts = $0.48
Money left = Initial amount of money - Total cost of bolts
Money left = $12.48 - $0.48
Money left = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours, we need to determine her hourly rate. We can do this by dividing the amount she earned by the number of hours she worked.

Ella earned $33 for 3 hours of work. 

Hourly rate = Total earnings / Number of hours worked
Hourly rate = $33 / 3 hours
Hourly rate = $11 per hour

Now that we know her hourly rate, we can calculate her earnings for 12 hours.

Earnings for 12 hours = Hourly rate * Number of hours worked
Earnings for 12 hours = $11 per hour * 12 hours
Earnings for 12 hours = $132

"To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Paul has 52 marbles. His friend gave him 28 marbles, so now he has 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.

Then, he lost 1/4 of his marbles. To find 1/4 of 80, we multiply 80 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing 80 by 4. 

80 / 4 = 20

So, Paul lost 20 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has left, we subtract 20 from 80.

80 - 20 = 60

Therefore, Paul has 60 marbles left.

60"
"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points she gets from each type of question and add them together.

First, let's calculate the points from the multiple-choice questions. Amy correctly answers 80% of the 10 multiple-choice questions, so she gets 0.8 * 10 = 8 points from the multiple-choice questions.

Next, let's calculate the points from the true/false questions. Amy correctly answers 90% of the 20 true/false questions, so she gets 0.9 * 20 = 18 points from the true/false questions.

Now, let's calculate the points from the long-answer questions. Amy correctly answers 60% of the 5 long-answer questions, so she gets 0.6 * 5 = 3 points from the long-answer questions.

Finally, we multiply the points from each type of question by their respective point values and add them together. The multiple-choice and true/false questions are worth 1 point each, and the long-answer questions are worth 5 points each. So, we get:

(8 * 1) + (18 * 1) + (3 * 5) = 8 + 18 + 15 = 41

The final answer is: 41"
"To find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we first need to determine how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them, we can calculate the number of chickens he plans to sell as follows:

Number of chickens to sell = 300 * (3/5)
= 300 * 0.6
= 180 chickens

Now, we know that Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000 by selling these chickens at $50 each. To find the total revenue, we multiply the number of chickens by the selling price:

Total revenue = Number of chickens to sell * Selling price
= 180 * $50
= $9000

Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, we can find the total cost by subtracting the profit from the total revenue:

Total cost = Total revenue - Profit
= $9000 - $2000
= $7000

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"
"To find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 2, since they sold an equal number. 

Total glasses sold = 32
Number of people who sold an equal number of glasses = 2 (Micah and Mitchell)
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = Total glasses sold / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16

Since Julie sold 14 glasses, we can find out how many more glasses she sold than Micah by subtracting the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold.

Glasses sold by Julie - Glasses sold by Micah = 14 - 16 = -2

However, since we can't have a negative number of glasses, this means that Micah actually sold more glasses than Julie. The question asks for how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, but since Micah sold more, the answer will be negative.

The final answer is: $\boxed{-2}$"
"To find out how much Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them up.

The cost of the hair service is $400.

The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the cost of the hair service, which is 1/4 * $400 = $100.

The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the cost of the manicure, which is 3/4 * $100 = $75.

Now, let's add up the costs: $400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575.

"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope, we need to calculate the total amount of money she gets from selling the old rope and then subtract the cost of the new rope.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Sarah gets from selling the old rope. The rope is 20 meters long, and her friend is buying it for $2 a meter. 

Total money from selling the old rope = 20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 a meter, and Sarah wants to buy a rope of the same length (20 meters).

Cost of the new rope = 20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30

Now, let's subtract the cost of the new rope from the total money Sarah gets from selling the old rope to find out how much money she will have left over.

Money left over = Total money from selling the old rope - Cost of the new rope
Money left over = $40 - $30
Money left over = $10

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Melanie's current age. 

Let's assume Melanie's current age is 'x'. In 10 years, she will be 18 years old. So, we can write the equation as x + 10 = 18. 

Now, let's solve for 'x'. 
x + 10 = 18
x = 18 - 10
x = 8

Now that we know Melanie's current age is 8, we need to find in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. 

Let's assume the number of years is 'y'. So, her age after 'y' years will be 8 + y. We want this age to be thrice her current age, which is 3 * 8 = 24. 

Now, we can write the equation as 8 + y = 24. 

Now, let's solve for 'y'. 
8 + y = 24
y = 24 - 8
y = 16

So, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age in 16 years.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's find the cost of the chicken. Since each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and the 5 packs of bacon cost $10, the cost of one pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2. Therefore, the cost of one pack of chicken is $2 * 2 = $4. Since Kelly has 6 packs of chicken, the total cost of the chicken is 6 * $4 = $24.

Next, let's find the cost of the strawberries. Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of the strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

Now, let's find the cost of the apples. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. Since Kelly has 7 packs of apples, the total cost of the apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Finally, let's subtract the total cost of the items from Kelly's budget: $65 (budget) - $60 (total cost) = $5.

The final answer is: $5"
"Let's break down the information given. The final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, and it includes a 15-minute encore. The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. 

Let's denote the runtime of her usual concerts as 'x'. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, its runtime is 2x. Adding the 15-minute encore, the total runtime of the final concert is 2x + 15 = 65 minutes.

Now, we can solve for 'x':

2x + 15 = 65
Subtract 15 from both sides:
2x = 50
Divide both sides by 2:
x = 25

So, her usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can find the speed of the thingamabob by dividing the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11.

Speed of thingamabob = Speed of whatchamacallit / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig by multiplying the speed of the thingamabob by 5.

Speed of whirligig = Speed of thingamabob * 5
Speed of whirligig = 11 * 5
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, the price of the yogurt is $6 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of the salad and the yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.

Since Ellen pays a total of $11 for her daily goods, the cost of two carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.

To find the cost of one carrot, we divide the cost of two carrots by 2: $2 / 2 = $1.

"Let's break down the information given. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, the number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn is 3x. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's, so the number of times she mowed Alba's lawn is 5x.

The total number of lawns she mowed is x (Joe's) + 3x (Kamala's) + 5x (Alba's) = 9x.

We know that she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn. Since she mowed 9x lawns in total, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 9x * 6 = 54x.

We are given that she made a total of $80 from both lemonade sales and mowing lawns. So, the amount she made from lemonade sales is 80 - 54x.

However, we don't know the value of x. But we do know that she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, and that's the only lawn we know the price for. Since she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, and that's the only lawn we know the price for, we can assume that the price for each lawn is $6. 

Since she mowed 9x lawns, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 9x * 6 = 54x. We know that 54x = 54, so x = 1.

Now that we know x = 1, we can find the amount she made from lemonade sales. The amount she made from lemonade sales is 80 - 54x = 80 - 54(1) = 80 - 54 = 26.

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls, we can assume that the capacity of the pot is equivalent to 8 child bowls. 

After dinner, the adults (Calvin, his wife, and himself) will have eaten 3 bowls (since there are 3 adults). The children will have eaten 2 bowls. 

So, the total number of bowls eaten at dinner is 3 (adults) + 2 (children) = 5 bowls.

Since the pot can fill 8 child bowls, the leftover soup will be enough for 8 - 5 = 3 child bowls.

Therefore, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch 3 times from the leftover soup.

Now we can equate this to 2x:

52 = 2x

To find x, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 52 / 2
x = 26

This means Adam's age four years ago was 26. To find Adam's current age, we add 4 to x:

Adam's current age = 26 + 4 = 30

Finally, to find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8 = 38

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total acres of Farmer Smith's farm, we need to calculate twice the acres of Farmer Brown's farm and then add 100 to it. 

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. Twice that would be 2 * 200 = 400 acres. Adding 100 to that gives us 400 + 100 = 500 acres for Farmer Smith's farm.

Now, to find the total acres of both farms, we add the acres of Farmer Brown's farm to the acres of Farmer Smith's farm: 200 + 500 = 700 acres.

The final answer is: 700"
"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to calculate the total number of packages he completes in that time and then multiply it by his hourly wage.

First, let's find out how many packages Colby completes in an hour. He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total number of packages he completes in an eight-hour workday: 40 packages/hour * 8 hours = 320 packages.

Since Colby gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes, we can multiply the total number of packages by his hourly wage to find his total earnings: 320 packages * $0.20/package = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the time it takes to solve the extreme sudoku and then divide it by the time it takes to drink one bottle of water.

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so the time to solve an extreme sudoku is 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to convert the time to solve the extreme sudoku to hours and then divide by 0.5 (since there are 2 half hours in an hour). 

180 minutes is equal to 3 hours. 

Now, we divide 3 hours by 0.5 to get the number of half hours, which is 6. 

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, he drinks 6 bottles of water in 3 hours.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the red balloons and then subtract that from the total number of bologna pieces to find out how many were thrown at the yellow balloons.

Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and there are 20 red balloons, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

Now, we know that Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna at the bundle of balloons. To find out how many pieces were thrown at the yellow balloons, we subtract the number of pieces thrown at the red balloons from the total: 58 - 40 = 18.

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we can find the number of yellow balloons by dividing the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons by 3: 18 / 3 = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in 30 days. 

Since Jon drives 100 miles a day, the total miles driven in 30 days is 100 * 30 = 3000 miles.

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we need to divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs.

3000 miles / 1000 miles per tune-up = 3 tune-ups.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total hours Bruce works in the three days, we need to calculate the hours he works each day and add them up.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, which is 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours he works each day: 5 (Tuesday) + 10 (Wednesday) + 8 (Thursday) = 23 hours.

The final answer is: 23"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of money Julia and Nadine had, and then divide it by 2 to find out how much each of them received as allowance.

First, let's find the cost of the balloons. 1 dozen balloons is equal to 12 balloons. Since 2 balloons cost $0.5, 12 balloons will cost 12 * $0.5 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of the cake and the balloons is $11 + $3 = $14.

The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is $7 * 2 = $14.

The total cost of the cake, balloons, and ice cream is $14 + $14 = $28.

Since the total cost of the items is $28, and Julia and Nadine had the same amount of allowance, the total amount of allowance they had is also $28.

To find out how much each of them received, we divide the total allowance by 2: $28 / 2 = $14.

The final answer is: $14"
"To find out how many pieces of fruit are left, we need to first calculate the total number of fruits Kira bought. 

Kira bought 3 apples, 5 bananas, and 6 oranges. 

Total number of fruits = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14

Lola ate 2 pieces of the fruit. 

Number of fruits left = Total number of fruits - Number of fruits eaten
= 14 - 2
= 12

"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of students playing tennis. There are 6 students playing tennis, and twice that number are playing volleyball. So, the number of students playing volleyball is 6 * 2 = 12.

Now, let's find the total number of students playing soccer. There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so the total number of students playing soccer is 16 + 22 = 38.

Now, let's add the number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer to find the total number of students. 
6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total profit made by the class, we first need to find the total number of lollipops sold and the total cost of the lollipops.

Each student sold 10 lollipops, and there are 30 students. So, the total number of lollipops sold is 10 * 30 = 300.

The cost of each lollipop is $0.5, and the total number of lollipops sold is 300. So, the total cost of the lollipops is 0.5 * 300 = $150.

The selling price of each lollipop is $0.8, and the total number of lollipops sold is 300. So, the total revenue from selling the lollipops is 0.8 * 300 = $240.

The profit made by the class is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost, which is 240 - 150 = $90.

Therefore, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and then add them up.

Larry has 3 cats.

He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47

The final answer is: 47"
"To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to determine how many slices each person eats per day and then calculate the total number of slices they eat together per day.

Abby eats 2 slices a day. 
Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 * 2 = 4 slices a day.

Together, they eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices a day.

The loaf of bread has 24 slices. To find out how many days it will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat per day: 24 / 6 = 4.

"To find out how many shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and we want to know the total by her 10th birthday, we need to consider the months from her 5th birthday to her 10th birthday.

There are 12 months in a year. From her 5th birthday to her 10th birthday, Martha would have been 5 years old for 1 year, 6 years old for 1 year, 7 years old for 1 year, 8 years old for 1 year, and 9 years old for 1 year. 

So, the total number of months is 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

Since Martha collects one shell every month, the total number of shells she has collected by her 10th birthday is 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cups of tea are in each row. Since Lana divides the 27 cups into 3 rows, we can divide 27 by 3 to get the number of cups in each row.

27 cups / 3 rows = 9 cups per row

Since Lana creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row will be half of the total cups in each row.

9 cups per row / 2 = 4.5 cups of mint tea per row

However, since we can't have a fraction of a cup, we can assume that Lana will make whole cups of tea. This means that she will make 4 cups of mint tea in each row and 5 cups of chamomile tea in each row, as the total number of cups in each row is 9.

4 cups of mint tea per row"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip. 

Let's break down the problem: 

- The sloth has 8 hours to collect 24 berries.
- Each trip down, up, and back takes 4 hours, so the sloth can make 8 / 4 = 2 trips in 8 hours.
- Since the sloth picks the same number of berries on each trip, let's call the number of berries picked per trip 'x'.
- The total number of berries picked in 2 trips is 2x.
- We want to find the minimum value of 'x' such that 2x = 24.

To find the minimum value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

2x = 24
x = 24 / 2
x = 12

So, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days, we first need to determine the initial amount of water in the tank. Since Anthony and his father fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool, the initial amount of water in the tank is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Next, we need to find out how much water is used from the tank in 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so in 6 days, the amount of water used is 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons.

To find the remaining amount of water in the tank, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount: 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

The final answer is: 2000"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much money Colby has left and then determine how many movies he can see with the remaining money.

Colby's initial budget is $150. He has already spent money on:

- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total money spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Colby has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Each movie costs $10, and he wants to buy popcorn and candy for $8 + $2 = $10. So, he can spend $10 per movie and $10 for snacks, for a total of $20 per movie night.

Number of movies Colby can see: $20 / $20 = 1

However, since it's a Friday, he can also see one more movie on the same day. 

Total number of movies Colby can see: 1 + 1 = 2

"To find the total calories of the pastries, we first need to find the calories of a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin. 

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories. 

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, we can find the total calories of the mini cinnamon rolls: 200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories = 40,000 calories.

Next, we can find the total calories of the mini blueberry muffins: 300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories = 45,000 calories.

Finally, we can find the total calories of all the pastries: 40,000 calories + 45,000 calories = 85,000 calories.

"To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed and then divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, so 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Tuesday, so 2 * 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378

There are 5 days in total. 

Average number of Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days

"To find out how far each vehicle traveled, we need to multiply their speeds by the time they traveled.

The bus traveled 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it covered is 60 * 5 = 300 miles.

The car traveled 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it covered is 30 * 8 = 240 miles.

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus. 

300 - 240 = 60 miles.

"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls from the total number of toys she has now.

The total number of toys before buying the bouncy balls is the sum of blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings. 

Total toys before = 31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48

Now, we subtract this from the total number of toys after buying the bouncy balls to find the number of bouncy balls.

Number of bouncy balls = Total toys after - Total toys before

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old.
2. Paul is 10 years older than John.
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age.

Let's denote John's age as 'x'. Since Paul is 10 years older than John, Paul's age is 'x + 10'.

From point 3, we know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, which is (x + 10) + x = 2x + 10.

Now, we know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old. We can write an equation based on this information:

Peter's age + Paul's age + Jean's age = 100
(2x + 10) + (x + 10) + Jean's age = 100

Since we don't have any information about Jean's age, let's assume Jean's age is 'y'. Now the equation becomes:

(2x + 10) + (x + 10) + y = 100

Combine like terms:

3x + 20 + y = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:

3x + y = 80

Now, we need to find the value of x (John's age) to find Peter's age. Unfortunately, we still don't have enough information to find the value of x. However, we can express Peter's age in terms of x:

Peter's age = 2x + 10

Since we can't find a numerical value for Peter's age, we need to re-evaluate the problem statement. Let's re-examine the information given:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old.
2. Paul is 10 years older than John.
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age.

We can rewrite point 3 as: Peter's age = Paul's age + John's age

Now, let's denote Peter's age as 'P', Paul's age as 'P + 10', and John's age as 'J'. We can write the equation:

P = (P + 10) + J

Subtract P from both sides:

0 = 10 + J

Subtract 10 from both sides:

-10 = J

John's age is -10, which is not possible. This means the initial assumption that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age is incorrect.

However, let's re-examine the problem statement again. We can rewrite point 3 as: Peter's age = Paul's age + John's age

Let's denote Peter's age as 'P', Paul's age as 'P + 10', and John's age as 'J'. We can write the equation:

P = (P + 10) + J

Subtract P from both sides:

0 = 10 + J

Subtract 10 from both sides:

-10 = J

"To find the total number of balloons, we first need to calculate the initial number of balloons each person had and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria had 1 balloon, and each of her 4 friends had 2 balloons. So, the total number of balloons initially is:
1 (Maria's balloon) + (4 * 2) (friends' balloons) = 1 + 8 = 9 balloons

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is:
5 * 3 = 15 balloons

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons:
9 (initial balloons) + 15 (additional balloons) = 24 balloons

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how many tables they need, we first need to calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have. 

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so they have 10 * 5 = 50 boxes from donations. 
They already have 10 boxes, so the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, they will need 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

They already own 15 tables, so they need 30 - 15 = 15 more tables.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance spat by each person and then divide it by the total number of seeds spat.

Zoey spits 40 seeds, each 10 feet, so the total distance spat by Zoey is 40 * 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney spits 35 seeds, each 12 feet, so the total distance spat by Sydney is 35 * 12 = 420 feet.

The total distance spat by both is 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

The total number of seeds spat is 40 + 35 = 75.

The average total distance spat is 820 / 75 = 10.93 (rounded to two decimal places).

The final answer is: 10.93"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month and then find the difference in revenue.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month:

"To find out how much Cameron would save, we first need to calculate the cost of his stay with the option of adding 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark and then compare it to the cost of a 24-hour stay.

Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. Since the first 12 hours are already included in the initial charge, we need to calculate the cost of the additional 5 hours.

The cost of the additional 5 hours is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.

The total cost for Cameron's stay would be 1000 (initial 12-hour charge) + 350 (additional 5 hours) = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of a 24-hour stay, which is 1600 pesos.

The amount Cameron would save is 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final answer is: $250"
"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to calculate the amount each sheep needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Each goat needs 5 pounds, so twice that amount is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds. 
3 pounds less than 10 pounds is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Now, we know each goat needs 5 pounds and each sheep needs 7 pounds. 

The total amount of hay needed for the goats is 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds.
The total amount of hay needed for the sheep is 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds.

To find the total amount of hay needed, we add the amount needed for the goats and the amount needed for the sheep: 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds.

The final answer is: 159"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate John's total earnings, subtract his expenses, and then determine how much money he has left to spend on pens and pencils.

First, let's calculate John's total earnings: 
50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the pencils: 
5 pencils * 10 dollars/pencil = 50 dollars

Now, let's subtract John's gas expenses and the cost of the pencils from his total earnings: 
300 dollars - 50 dollars - 50 dollars = 200 dollars

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract that from his remaining money: 
200 dollars - 100 dollars = 100 dollars

Now, let's determine how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining money: 
100 dollars / 25 dollars = 4

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we first need to determine the total number of bottles she has initially and then subtract the number of bottles given to the students.

The teacher has 9 coupons, each redeemable for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles she has initially is 9 * 100 = 900 bottles.

Each of the 29 students gets 2 bottles of apple juice, so the total number of bottles given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58 bottles.

To find out how many bottles the teacher has left, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles she initially had: 900 - 58 = 842.

"To find the total amount Patty charged, we need to calculate the labor cost and add it to the cost of parts and the initial visit fee.

The labor cost is $35 per hour, and the job took 2.25 hours. Since the labor is charged per hour or part thereof, we need to round up to the nearest hour for the labor cost. However, in this case, 2.25 hours is less than 3 hours, so we can calculate the labor cost as $35 * 2 = $70.

The total cost is the sum of the labor cost, the cost of parts, and the initial visit fee: $70 (labor) + $60 (parts) + $40 (visit fee) = $170.

"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we first need to calculate the original price and then the price after the discount. 

The original price of 10 CDs at $15 each is 10 * $15 = $150.

Since James gets a 40% discount, we need to find 40% of $150. 
40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60.

So, the price after the discount is $150 - $60 = $90.

James decides to sell 5 CDs for $40 each. 
The total amount he gets from selling 5 CDs is 5 * $40 = $200.

However, he spent $90 on the CDs, and he got $200 from selling 5 of them. 

To find out how much money he was out, we need to subtract the amount he got from the amount he spent. 
$200 - $90 = $110.

James was out $110.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the time James took to swim 60% of the distance. 
Distance covered = 20 miles * 0.6 = 12 miles
Time taken to swim 12 miles = Distance / Speed = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours

Since he rests for half as long as the swimming time, he rests for 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, let's find the remaining distance to be covered = 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles
Time taken to swim the remaining distance at half the speed = 8 miles / (2 miles per hour * 0.5) = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours

Total time taken = Time taken to swim 12 miles + Time taken to rest + Time taken to swim the remaining distance
Total time taken = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours

"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

Deanna is 26 years old. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old.

Since Marcus is half of Leo's age, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship: 

Let L be Leo's age. Then, 0.5L = 21 (since Marcus is half of Leo's age).

To find Leo's age, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

L = 21 * 2
L = 42

So, Leo is 42 years old.

The final answer is: 42"
"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Bahati and Dinar. 

Let's denote the points scored by Dinar as 'x'. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati's points can be represented as 'x + 10'. 

We also know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Azibo's points can be represented as '(x + 10) - 20' or 'x - 10'.

The total points scored by the team is 45, which is the sum of the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar. We can write this as an equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x - 10) = 45

Combine like terms:

3x = 45

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 15

Now that we know Dinar scored 15 points, we can find Azibo's points by subtracting 10 from Bahati's points. However, we first need to find Bahati's points. Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, and we know Dinar scored 15 points, we can represent Bahati's points as '15 + 20' or '35'. 

Now that we know Bahati scored 35 points, we can find Azibo's points by subtracting 20 from Bahati's points:

Azibo's points = Bahati's points - 20
Azibo's points = 35 - 20
Azibo's points = 15

However, this is incorrect because we know Azibo's points are 20 less than Bahati's points. Since Bahati's points are 35, we can find Azibo's points by subtracting 20 from Bahati's points. However, we know that Azibo's points are 20 less than Bahati's points, and we know Dinar's points are 15. We can represent Azibo's points as '15 + 20' or '35'. However, this is incorrect because we know Azibo's points are 20 less than Bahati's points. 

Let's re-evaluate the equation: x + (x + 10) + (x - 10) = 45. We know that x = 15. However, we can represent Azibo's points as 'x - 10'. We know that x = 15, so Azibo's points = 15 - 10 = 5."
"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book in inches.

Since each paper is 100 pages to the inch and each paper is printed on both sides, we have 200 pages per inch (100 pages per side).

Given that the book is 1.5 inches thick, we can multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book:

200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 300 pages

"To find the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total time he spent stapling reports and then multiply it by the number of reports he can staple per minute.

First, let's find the total time in minutes. Vince stapled reports from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. 

15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find the number of reports he can staple per minute, we divide 30 by 15.

30 reports / 15 minutes = 2 reports/minute

Now, we multiply the total minutes by the number of reports he can staple per minute.

900 minutes * 2 reports/minute = 1800 reports

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed, we first need to determine her usual sleep duration and then subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up earlier.

Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. This means her usual sleep duration is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, her usual sleep duration in minutes is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so her actual wake-up time was 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m. 

Her usual wake-up time in minutes is 6 a.m. * 60 = 360 minutes. So, she woke up 360 - 5 = 355 minutes after 10 p.m.

Now, we need to find out the time she went to sleep that day. Since she was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m., we need to find the time she went to sleep before 2:15 a.m. 

We know she woke up 355 minutes after 10 p.m. and her usual wake-up time is 6 a.m. To find the time she went to sleep, we need to subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up 5 minutes earlier from her usual wake-up time.

First, let's convert 2:15 a.m. to minutes: 2 * 60 + 15 = 135 minutes after 10 p.m.

Now, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking (135 minutes) and the time she woke up 5 minutes earlier (5 minutes) from her usual wake-up time (355 minutes): 355 - 135 - 5 = 215 minutes.

So, she went to sleep 215 minutes after 10 p.m. 

Now, we can find her actual sleep duration by subtracting the time she went to sleep from her actual wake-up time: 355 - 215 = 140 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. 

Since Jonathan has two dozen cups, and one dozen is equal to 12, he has 2 * 12 = 24 measuring cups.

It is given that Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. So, the number of measuring spoons he has is 2/3 * 24 = 16.

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons.

Now, to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we add the number of measuring cups and measuring spoons he has left. 

Total number of utensils = 24 (measuring cups) + 10 (measuring spoons) = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we first need to find the number of occupied beds and then subtract it from the total capacity.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied. 

1/5 of 1000 is 100. So, the number of occupied beds is 100.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we need to find the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks have 14 days.

The total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks is 50 * 14 = 700.

Now, we add the initial occupied beds and the beds occupied in 2 weeks: 100 + 700 = 800.

The number of unoccupied beds is the total capacity minus the occupied beds: 1000 - 800 = 200.

The final answer is: 200"

Two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to her family. Two-thirds of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6. This means 6 emails are to her family.

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after subtracting the family emails from the non-work emails. 9 - 6 = 3.

One-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend. One-third of 3 is (1/3) * 3 = 1.

"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number reported by Courtney and subtract it from her total.

Let's assume the number of people reported by Courtney is 100%. 
20% of 100 is 20. 

Now, subtract 20 from 100 to find the actual percentage of people who attended the concert: 100 - 20 = 80%.

Now, we need to find 80% of the number reported by Courtney, which is 48. 

To find 80% of 48, multiply 48 by 0.8 (since 80% = 80/100 = 0.8): 
48 * 0.8 = 38.4

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is: 38.4"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that Jason carried 2 balls, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. This means Jeffrey carried half the number of balls Jason carried, which is 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them: 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

However, this is the number of balls they carried, not the total number of balls the coach brought to practice. Since they carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is equal to the number of balls they carried.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of holes dug on the first day as H1 = 10, the second day as H2 = 13, and the third day as H3 = 8. However, we need to subtract the 2 holes that were filled in, so the actual number of holes at the end of the third day is H3 - 2 = 6.

The total number of holes at the end of the third day is the sum of the holes dug on the first three days minus the 2 holes filled in: H1 + H2 + H3 - 2 = 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29.

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. This means the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * H1 = 4 * 10 = 40.

Since we know the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 40, and we know the number of holes at the end of the third day is 29, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 40 - 29 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and the third person got 15 more than each of them. 

Let's denote the number of corn chips the third person got as x. Since the third person got 15 more than Amora and Lainey, we can write an equation:

x = 70 + 15
x = 85

So, the third person got 85 corn chips. 

Now, we know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and the third person got 85 corn chips. To find the total number of corn chips, we add the number of corn chips each person got:

Total corn chips = 70 + 70 + 85
Total corn chips = 225

Since the tickets for travel cost 50% more than the supplies, we need to calculate 50% of $400 and add it to the cost of the supplies.

50% of $400 is calculated as 0.5 * $400 = $200.

Now, we add this to the cost of the supplies: $400 + $200 = $600.

So, the total cost of travel is $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as X. 

We know that X = S + 5 (Alex has caught 5 more than Stan). 

We also know that S = 4A - 13 (Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe).

We can substitute the value of S from the second equation into the first equation: X = (4A - 13) + 5.

We also know that X + S + A = 339 (Together they have caught 339 Pokémon).

Now we can substitute the value of X from the first equation into the third equation: (4A - 13 + 5) + S + A = 339.

Simplifying the equation: 4A + A - 8 + S = 339.

Combine like terms: 5A + S - 8 = 339.

We can substitute the value of S from the second equation into the equation: 5A + (4A - 13) - 8 = 339.

Simplifying the equation: 5A + 4A - 13 - 8 = 339.

Combine like terms: 9A - 21 = 339.

Add 21 to both sides: 9A = 360.

Divide by 9: A = 40.

Now that we know A, we can find S: S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147.

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to find half of the number of minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, there are 20 minutes per episode. Half of 20 is 10. 

So, there are 10 episodes in total. 

To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode: 10 episodes * 20 minutes per episode = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and then add it to the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the southerly direction for the first 10 hours:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours
Distance = 300 miles

Then, the bird flies towards the north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 36 miles

Since this distance is in the opposite direction, we need to subtract it from the initial distance to find the net distance traveled in the southerly direction:
Net distance = 300 miles - 36 miles
Net distance = 264 miles

Finally, the bird flies towards the south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 110 miles

To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we add the net distance traveled in the southerly direction and the distance traveled in the final southerly direction:
Total distance = Net distance + Distance
Total distance = 264 miles + 110 miles
Total distance = 374 miles

The final answer is: 374"
"To find the total number of brownies Greta had left over, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and subtract the number of brownies eaten.

Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself, which is 12 brownies. 
She received 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office, which is 6 brownies. 
Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies. 
So, the total number of brownies she received is 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

To find the number of brownies left over, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies received: 66 - 18 = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total age of all three family members, we first need to find the age of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means her age is 75% of Nani's age. To find 75% of Nani's age, we multiply his age by 0.75. So, Nani's sister's age is 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we add up the ages of all three family members: Nani's age (8 years) + his brother's age (16 years) + his sister's age (6 years) = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time it takes for each type of stringing and then add them up.

For synthetic gut, it takes 15 minutes per racquet, and there are 3 racquets. So, the total time for synthetic gut is 3 * 15 = 45 minutes.

For polyester string, it takes 22 minutes per racquet, and there are 5 racquets. So, the total time for polyester string is 5 * 22 = 110 minutes.

For hybrid sets, it takes 18 minutes per racquet, and there are 4 racquets. So, the total time for hybrid sets is 4 * 18 = 72 minutes.

Now, we add up the time for each type of stringing: 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes.

The final answer is: 227"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first two phones and the remaining phones. 

The first two phones cost the full price of $600 each, so the total cost for the first two phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.

The remaining phones are 2 (for the kids and his wife), and each of these phones is half the price of the first two, which is $600 / 2 = $300.

The total cost for the remaining phones is 2 * $300 = $600.

Now, we add the cost of the first two phones and the remaining phones to get the total cost: $1200 + $600 = $1800.

The final answer is: $1800"
"To find the total number of players in both teams, we first need to determine the number of players in Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players in Zeke's team by adding 7 to 13.

Zeke's team = Carlton's team + 7
Zeke's team = 13 + 7
Zeke's team = 20

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams, we add the number of players in Zeke's team to the number of players in Carlton's team.

Total players = Zeke's team + Carlton's team
Total players = 20 + 13
Total players = 33

The final answer is: 33"
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2 * (length + width).

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2.

Total slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total slats needed = 50 * 2
Total slats needed = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we first need to determine how many boxes she had left after giving some to her mom and sister. 

She bought 12 boxes of oranges and gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, so she gave away a total of 2 + 2 = 4 boxes. 

Now, we subtract the boxes she gave away from the total number of boxes she bought: 12 - 4 = 8 boxes.

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges in 8 boxes is 8 * 20 = 160 oranges.

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 160 = 40 oranges. 

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges: 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total number of states in both countries, we first need to determine the number of states in each country. 

The USA has 50 states. 

Half of 50 is 25. 

India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, so it has 25 + 4 = 29 states.

Now, we add the number of states in the USA and India: 50 + 29 = 79.

The total number of states in both countries together is 79."
"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books. 

The total cost of the books is the sum of the cost of the dictionary, the dinosaur book, and the children's cookbook. 

Total cost = $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, we need to subtract this from the total cost to find out how much more he needs to earn.

Amount needed to earn = Total cost - Amount saved = $39 - $14 = $25

Now, we can find out how many hours Tyler needs to work by dividing the amount he needs to earn by his hourly wage.

Hours needed to work = Amount needed to earn / Hourly wage = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more than Richard. This means Richard has 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.

Since the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert and Richard have 30 and 20 cherries respectively, Jerry must have 60 - (30 + 20) = 10 cherries.

Now, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. Robert has 30 cherries, and Jerry has 10 cherries. So, Robert has 30 - 10 = 20 more cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the information given:

On Saturday, the number of boxes of gingerbread sold is 10. 
On Sunday, the number of boxes of gingerbread sold is 5 more than Saturday, which is 10 + 5 = 15.

The number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday is 4 fewer than Sunday. 
On Sunday, the number of boxes of apple pie sold is 15. 
So, the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday is 15 - 4 = 11.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each day:

On Saturday, the total earnings from gingerbread is 10 * $6 = $60. 
The total earnings from apple pie is 11 * $15 = $165. 
The total earnings on Saturday is $60 + $165 = $225.

On Sunday, the total earnings from gingerbread is 15 * $6 = $90. 
The total earnings from apple pie is 15 * $15 = $225. 
The total earnings on Sunday is $90 + $225 = $315.

The total earnings for two days is $225 + $315 = $540.

The final answer is: $540"
"To determine the total number of bottles Pamela needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use. 

Since Pamela reapplies sunscreen every hour and she will be outside for 4 hours a day, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day. 

Over 8 days, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day * 8 days = 32 times.

Each application is 1 ounce, so she will use 32 ounces of sunscreen in total.

Since each bottle contains 8 ounces, we need to divide the total amount of sunscreen she will use (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces) to find out how many bottles she needs.

32 ounces / 8 ounces per bottle = 4 bottles.

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen for her vacation.

"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

First, let's find 40% of the price of the blue car:
40% of $100 = 0.4 * $100 = $40

Now, subtract $40 from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car:
$100 - $40 = $60

So, the price of the red car is $60.

The price of the blue car is $100, and the price of the red car is $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Emil is 19 years old now. When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad and twice as old as his brother. 

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's current age as D, and his brother's current age as B. 

We know that E = 19. 

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = 0.5D. 

We can solve for D by multiplying both sides by 2: 48 = D.

Now, when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B. 

We can solve for B by dividing both sides by 2: B = 12.

Now that we have the current ages of Emil's dad and brother, we can find the sum of their ages: D + B = 48 + 12 = 60.

"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads she received from her mother, sister, and friend, and then add them together.

Adrianne's mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day and add them together.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.
On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by the serving size: 21 / 3 = 7.

"To find the number of students leaving early, we first need to find the number of football players and then add the number of cheerleaders or band members.

First, let's find the number of football players. 20% of 30 students are football players. 

20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6

So, there are 6 football players.

Now, let's find the number of remaining students. 
30 - 6 = 24

Out of the remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band.

25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6

So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members.

Now, let's add the number of football players and cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early.
6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12

Charlie's size = 5 * Sophie's size
Charlie's size = 5 * 5
Charlie's size = 25

Now, we can find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie by adding their sizes and dividing by 2:

Average size = (Sophie's size + Charlie's size) / 2
Average size = (5 + 25) / 2
Average size = 30 / 2
Average size = 15

"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to calculate the total space available for plants. 

First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches, since the width of the plants is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the length of the flower bed in inches is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches.

Next, we need to calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between them. The width of each plant is 12 inches, and Pat wants to leave 1.5 feet (18 inches) between each plant. So, the total space required for each plant is 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

Now, let's calculate the total space available for plants in the flower bed, subtracting the space required for the 17 plants Pat already owns. However, we need to calculate the total space available for new plants. The total space available for new plants is 1332 - (17 * 30) = 1332 - 510 = 822 inches.

Now, let's calculate the number of new plants Pat can fit in the flower bed. The number of new plants is 822 / 30 = 27.4. Since Pat can't buy a fraction of a plant, she can buy 27 new plants.

The total number of plants Pat will have is 17 (plants she already owns) + 27 (new plants) = 44 plants.

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost will be 44 * 6 = $264.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of petunias: 
Number of petunias per basket = 3
Number of baskets = 5
Total number of petunias = 3 * 5 = 15
Cost of each petunia = $3.00
Total cost of petunias = 15 * $3.00 = $45.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of sweet potato vines:
Number of sweet potato vines per basket = 2
Number of baskets = 5
Total number of sweet potato vines = 2 * 5 = 10
Cost of each sweet potato vine = $2.50
Total cost of sweet potato vines = 10 * $2.50 = $25.00

Now, let's add the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines together:

"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we first need to calculate how much she saves each month. 

Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets 25% of her paycheck aside for shoes. To find 25% of $2,000.00, we multiply $2,000.00 by 0.25.

$2,000.00 * 0.25 = $500.00

So, Jessica saves $500.00 each month for shoes. 

To find out how many shoes she can buy in a year, we need to multiply the monthly savings by 12 (the number of months in a year).

$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy with $6,000.00. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp. 

First, let's find out how long it takes her to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, we can divide 90 by 6 to get the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. 

90 / 6 = 15 minutes

Now, let's find out how long it takes her to cook 90 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can divide 90 by 30 to find out how many batches she needs to cook. 

90 / 30 = 3 batches

Since each batch takes 10 minutes, we can multiply the number of batches by the time it takes to cook each batch. 

3 batches * 10 minutes/batch = 30 minutes

However, we need to add the time it takes to peel the shrimp to the time it takes to cook them. 

15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (cooking) = 45 minutes

So, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour on low and 3 degrees per hour on high.
2. The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour without the air conditioner.
3. The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, so it cooled the room by 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.
4. Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, so it cooled the room by 3 * 4 = 12 degrees.
5. The total cooling effect of the air conditioner is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.
6. However, the room warmed up for 2 hours without the air conditioner, so it warmed up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, the time between Bill's first sighting and his dad's sighting is 30 years. 

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the time between the two sightings: 3x - x = 75 + 30. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x = 105. 

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 52.5. 

Since Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet, the time between Bill's first sighting and his dad's sighting is 30 years. 

So, Bill was 30 - 30 = 0 years old when his dad saw the comet. However, this is not possible since Bill was 30 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Let's re-evaluate the problem again. The time between Bill's first sighting and his dad's sighting is 75 years. 

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, the time between Bill's first sighting and his dad's sighting is 75 years. 

Let's denote the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet as 'x'. Since Bill saw the comet when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, Bill's age at that time is 3x.

We can set up an equation to represent the time between the two sightings: 3x - x = 75. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x = 75.

"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each category and then add them up.

1. Checks for the electric bill: 1 check per month, so 12 checks per year.
2. Checks for the gas bill: 1 check per month, so 12 checks per year.
3. Checks to the church: 2 checks per month, so 24 checks per year.
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 1 check every 3 months, so 4 checks per year.

Now, let's add up the total number of checks: 
12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the total number of flights made by the first plane in a day is 'x'. Since the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, the number of flights to Greece is (3/4)x. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is (1/4)x.

We are given that the second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes in a day. So, the total number of flights made by the first plane is 2 * 44 = 88.

Now, we can set up the equation: x = 88. We already know that (1/4)x is the number of flights to France. 

To find the number of flights to France, we can substitute x = 88 into the equation (1/4)x.

(1/4) * 88 = 22

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the individual howling times and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6. 
His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since the trousers cost $30, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers to find out how much he had to contribute from his savings: $30 - $18 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's denote the age of Wilfred as 'W'. Since Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, we can express this as:

Helene's age = 2 * (Average age of the group)

We know that the total age of the children is 20, and there are 4 children. So, the average age of the group is:

Average age = Total age / Number of children
= 20 / 4
= 5

Now, we can express Helene's age in terms of the average age:

Helene's age = 2 * Average age
= 2 * 5
= 10

We also know that Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. So, the sum of their ages is:

Akbar's age + Alessandro's age = 3 + 4 = 7

The total age of the group is the sum of the ages of all four children:

Total age = Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age
20 = 7 + 10 + W

Now, we can solve for W:

20 = 17 + W
W = 20 - 17
W = 3

"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we first need to calculate the total amount collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund. 

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Since everyone else (Walter's neighbors and the online fund) donated $2000, Walter's lawyer will donate 3 * $2000 = $6000.

However, the problem states that Walter is going to tell his lawyer about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200. This implies that Walter's friend's donation is not included in the amount that Walter's lawyer will base his donation on. Therefore, Walter's lawyer will donate 3 * $2000 = $6000.

"To find the total number of cookies, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies brought by the guests. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is 1/2 * 1500 = 750.

Since each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received. 

Number of people in the church = Total cookies given to the church / Cookies per person
= 750 / 15

"To solve this problem, let's assume the total number of slices the watermelon is divided into is 'x'. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is 6. 

Let's say each kid gets 'k' slices. Since each adult gets twice as many slices as each kid, each adult gets '2k' slices. 

We know that the total number of slices is 6, so we can write the equation: 2(2k) + 4k = 6. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 4k + 4k = 6, which is 8k = 6. 

Dividing both sides by 8, we get k = 6/8, which simplifies to k = 3/4. 

Since each kid gets 3/4 of a slice, each adult gets 2 * (3/4) = 3/2 slices. 

The total number of slices is 6, so the total number of slices is 6. The total number of slices is 6. 

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to find the fraction of the total number of slices each adult gets. Since each adult gets 3/2 slices, the fraction of the total number of slices each adult gets is (3/2)/6 = 1/4. 

To convert this fraction to a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/4) * 100 = 25%.

"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we first need to calculate the total time he spends on rounds and appointments.

Time spent on rounds: 
- Number of inpatients: 9
- Time per inpatient: 20 minutes
- Total time spent on rounds: 9 * 20 = 180 minutes

Time spent on appointments: 
- Number of appointments: 10
- Time per appointment: 30 minutes
- Total time spent on appointments: 10 * 30 = 300 minutes

Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 + 300 = 480 minutes

Since Doctor Jones works for 9 hours at the clinic, we need to convert this to minutes: 
- 9 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 540 minutes

Now, we subtract the total time spent on rounds and appointments from the total time he works: 
- 540 minutes - 480 minutes = 60 minutes

To convert the remaining time back to hours: 
- 60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

So, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records.

"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake. 

First, let's add the time it takes to make the cake batter (20 minutes) and bake the cake (30 minutes): 20 + 30 = 50 minutes.

Next, we add the time it takes to cool the cake (2 hours, which is 120 minutes) and the time it takes to frost the cake (10 minutes): 120 + 10 = 130 minutes. 

Now, we add the time it takes to make the cake batter and bake the cake (50 minutes) to the time it takes to cool and frost the cake (130 minutes): 50 + 130 = 180 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

Now, we add the 3 hours to the time at which Jordan wants to serve the cake (5:00 pm) to find the latest time she can start making the cake: 5:00 pm + 3 hours = 8:00 pm.

The final answer is 8."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to first find the total number of boxes sold by both Lisa and Peter. 

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. 
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars. 

Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars. 

We know that they sold 64 chocolate bars together. So, we can set up the equation: 
8x = 64

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8:
x = 64 / 8
x = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box. 

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of students per session, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

The studio is rented 3 days a week, so it's rented 3 * 4 = 12 days in a month (assuming a 4-week month).

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25. 
The cost of students per session is $1.50 per student, and there are 10 students, so the total cost of students per session is 10 * $1.50 = $15.

The total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $15 (students) = $40.

Since the studio is rented 12 days in a month, the total number of sessions in a month is 12.

The total earnings per month would be the total cost per session multiplied by the number of sessions in a month, which is $40 * 12 = $480.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $480."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box for both Peter and Martha, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

"To find the number of female porcupines, we multiply the total population by 3/5. 

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of babies born in a month is 30 * 4 = 120.

In a year, there are 12 months, so the total number of babies born in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The total number of porcupines after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the number of babies born in a year. 

Total porcupines after a year = 50 + 1440 = 1490

"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the gallons of water needed, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. There are 7.48 gallons in a cubic foot, so:

Volume in gallons = 1400 * 7.48
Volume in gallons = 10472 gallons

Now, we multiply the volume in gallons by 5.9 to get the total gallons needed:
Total gallons = 10472 * 5.9
Total gallons = 61851.28 gallons

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the total gallons by the cost per gallon:
Cost = 61851.28 * 0.10
Cost = 6185.128

The final answer is: $6185.13"

Half of the students are over 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500
One-fourth of the students over 16 are male: 1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16
So, the number of female students over 16 = 1500 - 375 = 1125

The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500
One-half of the students under 16 are male: 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16
So, the number of female students under 16 = 1500 - 750 = 750

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how much water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day. 

Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. 
Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. 
Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water pumped on both days. 
Wanda's total = 4500 + 3000 = 7500 gallons.
Ms. B's total = 3375 + 1125 = 4500 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped is 7500 + 4500 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the remaining amount of water needed to fill the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour for 5 hours, and the second part where it loses 7% of its capacity per hour for 3 hours.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x.

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is 0.91x (since 100% - 9% = 91%).

Now, in the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining is 0.91x * 0.93 (since 100% - 7% = 93%).

We are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. So, we can set up the equation:

0.91x * 0.93 = 0.28

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.8463 (which is 0.91 * 0.93):

x = 0.28 / 0.8463
x = 0.33

So, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 33%.

Her hourly wage is $10, and her hourly tips are $15. So, her total hourly earnings are $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1000.

Now, we need to find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car. 

20% of $10,000 is 0.2 * $10,000 = $2000.

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save the down payment, we divide the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her weekly earnings ($1000).

$2000 / $1000 = 2

So, Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has spent so far. 

3 peaches at $0.5 each will be 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
4 pears at $0.5 each will be 4 * $0.5 = $2
2 kiwis at $1 each will be 2 * $1 = $2
5 apples at $0.75 each will be 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Adding these amounts together, Jamaar has spent $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9 so far.

Since Jamaar has $10, he has $10 - $9 = $1 left.

Plums cost $0.25 each, so we can divide the remaining amount by the cost of a plum to find out how many plums he can buy: $1 / $0.25 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each friend received, we first need to determine the total number of packs Anne gave away. Since she kept 2 packs for herself, she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Next, we need to find out how many packs each friend received. Since Anne gave the packs to 10 friends equally, we divide the total packs given away (13) by the number of friends (10). 

13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs per friend. However, since we can't divide a pack into fractions, we can round down to 1 pack per friend, and then find out how many pieces are in that pack.

Each pack has 60 pieces, so 1 pack has 60 pieces. 

Now, we multiply the number of packs each friend received (1) by the number of pieces in each pack (60) to find out how many pieces each friend received.

1 pack * 60 pieces = 60 pieces per friend.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures by 8.

Total pictures = 72
Pictures per album = Total pictures / Number of albums
Pictures per album = 72 / 8
Pictures per album = 9

Now, we know that 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits. Since the number of pictures per album is 9, we can multiply this by the number of albums for each category to find the total number of selfies and portraits.

Selfies = Pictures per album * Number of selfie albums
Selfies = 9 * 3
Selfies = 27

Portraits = Pictures per album * Number of portrait albums
Portraits = 9 * 2
Portraits = 18

The final answer is: 
Selfies: 27
Portraits: 18"
"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to determine how many sets of 3 pages he reads and then multiply that by the time it takes him to read one set of 3 pages.

Since James reads 18 pages, we can divide 18 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 pages he reads: 18 / 3 = 6.

Now, we know it takes James 10 minutes to read one set of 3 pages. Since he reads 6 sets, we multiply 10 minutes by 6: 10 * 6 = 60.

James spends 60 minutes reading."
"To find the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to calculate the number of guests who checked in and subtract the number of guests who checked out.

Initially, there were 100 guests. 

24 guests checked out early, so the remaining guests are 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, so the number of guests who have checked out is 24 (early checkout) + 15 (late checkout) = 39.

The number of guests who have not checked out is 76 - 39 = 37.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30.

So, the total number of guests who have checked in is 30 (in the afternoon) + 7 (after dinner) = 37.

Now, we add the number of guests who have checked in to the number of guests who have not checked out: 37 (checked in) + 37 (not checked out) = 74.

The final answer is: 74"
"To find out how many bananas John has, we need to calculate the total number of bananas he picked. 

On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas. 
On Thursday, he picked 6 bananas. 
On Friday, he picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add up the total number of bananas John picked: 4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find out how many points Aries is sure to get, we first need to determine the number of questions in each category. 

There are 60 questions in total. 40% of them are easy, so the number of easy questions is 40% of 60, which is 0.4 * 60 = 24 questions.

The rest of the questions are equally divided between average and difficult, so there are (60 - 24) / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 0.75 * 24 = 18 easy questions.

She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 0.5 * 18 = 9 average questions and 0.5 * 18 = 9 difficult questions.

So, the total number of questions Aries is sure to get is 18 (easy) + 9 (average) + 9 (difficult) = 36 questions.

The final answer is: 36"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume the number of large stuffed animals sold is 'x'. Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2x.

The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal, which is $4. So, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total earnings from the sales is $120. The earnings from the sale of large stuffed animals is $12x and the earnings from the sale of small stuffed animals is $4 * 2x = $8x.

The total earnings from the sales is the sum of the earnings from the sale of large and small stuffed animals, which is $12x + $8x = $20x.

Since the total earnings is $120, we can set up the equation $20x = $120.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20: x = $120 / $20 = 6.

Since the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2x, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2 * 6 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches they eat per day and then multiply it by 7.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, the wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and the son eats 2 sandwiches per day. 

Total sandwiches per day = 5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day.

Now, we multiply the total sandwiches per day by 7 to get the total sandwiches in a week.

Total sandwiches in a week = 11 sandwiches per day * 7 days = 77 sandwiches.

The final answer is: 77"
"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings and then subtract the amount she gave to her sisters.

First, let's calculate her earnings from selling cookies: 80 cookies * $1 each = $80.

Next, let's calculate her earnings from selling cupcakes: 60 cupcakes * $4 each = $240.

Now, let's add her earnings from cookies and cupcakes: $80 + $240 = $320.

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave away a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

Now, let's subtract the amount she gave to her sisters from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings.

The final answer is: $300"
"To find the number of eggs found by the friends, we first need to determine the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins. Since each twin found 30 eggs, the total number of eggs found by the twins is 2 * 30 = 60.

Now, we know that all the eggs except 10 were found by the twins and their friends. This means that the total number of eggs found by the twins and their friends is 100 - 10 = 90.

Since the twins found 60 eggs, the number of eggs found by the friends can be calculated by subtracting the number of eggs found by the twins from the total number of eggs found by the twins and their friends. 

Number of eggs found by friends = Total eggs found by twins and friends - Eggs found by twins
= 90 - 60

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then multiply it by 40 dwarves and 30 days.

First, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe. Since he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe as with his bare hands, he can mine 2 * 12 = 24 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe.

Now, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. He can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe. 50% of 24 pounds is 0.5 * 24 = 12 pounds. So, he can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes. 40 dwarves can mine 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds of ore per day.

Finally, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in 30 days with steel pickaxes. 1440 pounds per day * 30 days = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for the first two packages. 

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.5 per sandwich. 

The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.5 per sandwich. 

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is consistent across all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is $1.5.

To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches: $1.5 * 8 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we first need to calculate the remaining amount he owes after using the money from selling his old bedroom set.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount Tom gets from selling his old bedroom: $1000
Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we need to calculate 10% of $2000.

10% of $2000 = 0.1 * $2000 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month. 

The final answer is: $200"
"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 40% of 25 is 0.4 * 25 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 6, so she released 6 yellow balloons, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

Now, let's calculate the total number of balloons she carried into the school. She had 15 red balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons. 

15 + 6 + 6 = 27

"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the scenarios where he won't get an extension. 

First, let's consider the scenario where the substitute teacher is present. In this case, there's a 50% chance of the substitute teacher being present, and since the homework won't be collected in this scenario, the probability of having to turn in the homework is 0.

Next, let's consider the scenario where the normal teacher is present. In this case, there's a 60% chance (100% - 40% extension chance) that the class won't get an extension. Within this scenario, there's a 80% chance (100% - 20% chance of getting a personal extension) that Marcus won't get a personal extension.

Now, we can calculate the probability of each scenario and multiply them together to find the overall probability of not getting an extension.

Probability of substitute teacher: 0.5
Probability of not getting an extension with substitute teacher: 1 (since homework won't be collected)
Probability of normal teacher: 0.5
Probability of not getting an extension with normal teacher: 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.48

Now, we can multiply these probabilities together to find the overall probability of not getting an extension:

0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * 0.48 = 0.5 + 0.24 = 0.74

To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we subtract this value from 1:

1 - 0.74 = 0.26

So, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 26%."
"To find out how many tickets each graduate can receive, we first need to determine the total number of available seats for guests. 

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center: 6000
Seats for graduates: 950
Seats for faculty: 300

Total seats taken: 950 (graduates) + 300 (faculty) = 1250
Available seats for guests: 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive.

4750 (available seats) / 950 (number of graduates) = 5

So, each graduate can receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the relationship between the number of small beans and the number of large beans. 

First, we know that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. This means that the number of small beans is 3 times the number of medium beans.

Since Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, the number of medium beans is 2 times the number of large beans. 

Let's denote the number of large beans as L. Then, the number of medium beans is 2L, and the number of small beans is 3 * 2L = 6L.

We are given that it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up. So, L = 75.

Now, we can find the number of small beans by substituting L = 75 into the equation for the number of small beans: 6L = 6 * 75 = 450.

The final answer is: 450"
"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total earnings and total expenses. 

Total earnings = Daily earnings * Number of days
Total earnings = $15 * 3
Total earnings = $45

Total expenses = Daily expenses * Number of days
Total expenses = $3 * 3
Total expenses = $9

Now, let's calculate her net earnings.
Net earnings = Total earnings - Total expenses
Net earnings = $45 - $9
Net earnings = $36

Since Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, we need to find the total hours she worked.
Total hours = 6 hours/day * 3 days
Total hours = 18 hours

"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to first find out how many soda bottles he can place along the driveway. 

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the width of the driveway by the spacing between the bottles:

24 feet / 3 feet = 8 bottles

Since it takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we multiply the number of bottles by the time it takes to place each one:

8 bottles * 5 seconds/bottle = 40 seconds

So, it will take Richard 40 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many packs Uncle Franky can make, we first need to find out how many apples he has in total. Since he ordered two boxes and each box has 40 apples, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of apples in each box.

Total apples = 2 boxes * 40 apples/box = 80 apples

Now, we need to find out how many packs he can make with 80 apples. Since each pack has 8 apples, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each pack.

Number of packs = Total apples / apples per pack = 80 / 8 = 10

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost due to loans and not working while in college. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of loans he took: 
4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money he lost by not working while in college. 
He earned $25,000 per year before college, so in 4 years, he would have earned:
4 years * $25,000/year = $100,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he lost:
$200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000

After graduating, his income triples, so he now earns $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year.

To find out how long it will take him to earn the money he lost, we can divide the total amount of money he lost by his new income:
$300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years

So, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"To find the total area of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the two pieces of fabric. 

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, we add 2 feet to both the length and the width of the bed.

New length = 6 + 2 = 8 feet
New width = 8 + 2 = 10 feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the new dimensions by 2 to get the total area of fabric needed.

Total length = 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Total width = 10 * 2 = 20 feet

Now, we multiply the total length and total width to get the total area of fabric needed.

Total area = Total length * Total width = 16 * 20 = 320 square feet

The total area of fabric Jim needs to buy is 320 square feet."
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then add them up.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 
So, they delivered 204 + 5 = 209 letters on Wednesday.

Now, let's add up the number of letters delivered each day: 
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736

"Let's denote the share of the first person as 'x'. 

Since the second person took $80 more than the first, the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Combine like terms: x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920.

Combine like terms again: 4x + 240 = 1920.

Subtract 240 from both sides: 4x = 1680.

Divide both sides by 4: x = 420.

The share of the first person is $420.

"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we first need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks have 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since the painters worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to find out how many hours that is. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 of 24 hours is (3/8) * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days to get the total hours worked: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4 to get the hours worked by each painter: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Expanding the equation:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

Number of balls in the first set = x + 4
= 6 + 4

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010.

Initial price of the car = $20,000
Depreciation rate = 21% per year

Year 2008:
Price in 2008 = Initial price - (Initial price * depreciation rate)
= $20,000 - ($20,000 * 0.21)
= $20,000 - $4,200
= $15,800

Year 2009:
Price in 2009 = Price in 2008 - (Price in 2008 * depreciation rate)
= $15,800 - ($15,800 * 0.21)
= $15,800 - $3,328
= $12,472

Year 2010:
Price in 2010 = Price in 2009 - (Price in 2009 * depreciation rate)

"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to find the total number of books that are not written in English. 

Half of the books are written in English, which is 50 / 2 = 25 books. 

10% of the books are written in German, which is 10% of 50, or 0.1 * 50 = 5 books.

The total number of books written in English and German is 25 + 5 = 30 books.

Since there are 50 books in total, the number of books written in Spanish is 50 - 30 = 20 books.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance. 

First, let's calculate the total distance Bernice has driven: 
Distance driven = 325 kilometers/day * 4 days = 1300 kilometers

Now, let's subtract the distance driven from the total distance:
Total distance = 1955 kilometers
Distance driven = 1300 kilometers
Distance left = Total distance - Distance driven
Distance left = 1955 - 1300
Distance left = 655 kilometers

The final answer is: 655"
"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we first need to calculate how many cups of water she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. To find out how many cups she drinks in 30 days, we multiply the number of cups she drinks per day by 30.

8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups

Now, we need to convert the total number of cups to gallons. There are 16 cups in a gallon. To find out how many gallons, we divide the total number of cups by 16.

240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Romeo boards the train with 120 people.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the total number of people on the train becomes:
120 (initial people) + 20 (new people) = 140

At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (100) board the train. So, the total number of people on the train becomes:
140 - 50 (people descended) + 100 (new people) = 190

At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the total number of people on the train becomes:
190 - 80 (people descended) = 110

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"To find the total amount Alison spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

1. The tank top costs $10.
2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48, but they were on sale for half price. Half of $48 is $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The athletic socks cost $8, and she had a coupon for $2 off, so the socks cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: $10 (tank top) + $15 (shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55.

The final answer is: $55"
"To find the total cost of renovating your kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and then multiply it by the cost of each tile.

First, let's find the area of a single tile. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1 ft, the area of a single tile is 1 ft * 1 ft = 1 SqFt.

Now, to find the total number of tiles required, we divide the total area of the kitchen floor by the area of a single tile:

Total area of kitchen floor = 200 SqFt
Area of a single tile = 1 SqFt
Total number of tiles = Total area of kitchen floor / Area of a single tile
Total number of tiles = 200 / 1
Total number of tiles = 200

Now, we multiply the total number of tiles by the cost of each tile to find the total cost:

Cost of each tile = $12
Total cost = Total number of tiles * Cost of each tile
Total cost = 200 * $12
Total cost = $2400

The final answer is: $2400"
"To find the increased cost of the insurance, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

60% of $120 = 0.6 * $120 = $72

Increased cost = Normal cost + Increased cost = $120 + $72 = $192

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we need to multiply it by 12.

Annual cost = Increased cost * 12 = $192 * 12 = $2304

The final answer is: $2304"
"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a week, we need to calculate the total number of twin and king size sheets he puts on the beds and then divide that by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. Since each twin bed requires 1 set of sheets and the king size bed requires 1 set of sheets, the total number of sets of sheets he puts on the beds is 4 (twin) + 1 (king) = 5 sets.

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 1, which is 2. This means that Greg can wash 2 twin sets of sheets and 1 king set of sheets in 2 loads.

Now, let's calculate the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a week. Since he has 5 sets of sheets to wash and he can wash 3 sets (2 twin + 1 king) in 2 loads, he will need 2.5 loads to wash all the sheets. However, since we can't have half a load, we round up to the nearest whole number. So, Greg does 3 loads of laundry in a week.

To find the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we multiply the number of loads he does in a week by the number of weeks in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year is 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year.

The final answer is: 156"
"To find the total number of movies Jill and her friends watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of movies they watch in one weekend and then multiply it by 4.

They watch 4 movies on Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in one weekend, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

To find the total number of movies they watch in 4 weeks, we multiply the number of movies they watch in one weekend by 4: 6 * 4 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how many stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to calculate the total number of stickers he collected over the past three years.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. 
Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.
This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.
Now, we add the stickers from this year to the total: 150 + 100 = 250 stickers.

So, Leo has 250 stickers in his collection.

The final answer is: 250"
"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount of cat food each cat eats per day (60 grams).

First, we need to calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's 3 cats eat per day. Since each cat eats 60 grams of food twice a day, we multiply 60 grams by 2 to get the daily consumption per cat, which is 120 grams. Then, we multiply this by the number of cats (3) to get the total daily consumption: 120 grams * 3 = 360 grams.

Now, we divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the total daily consumption (360 grams) to find out how many days it will last: 720 grams / 360 grams = 2 days.

The final answer is: 2"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

We know that Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake did, Jake must have eaten 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

We also know that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake did, so Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

To find the total number of slices eaten, we need to add up the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia. 

Total slices eaten = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices eaten = 10 + 7 + 14
Total slices eaten = 31

Total slices eaten = 31"
"Let's denote the time Donovan took to make his part as 'x'. Since Betsy took 18 minutes longer than Donovan, the time Betsy took can be represented as (x + 18).

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of the time taken by both Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. So, we can write the equation as:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since x represents the time Donovan took, and Betsy took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's part took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

The final answer is: 58"
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of the cast, the visit, the painkillers, and the parking.

The cost of the cast is $200.

The cost of the visit is $300/hour for 0.5 hours (30 minutes). So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.

The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill for 30 pills. So, the cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

The cost of parking is $6/hour for 2 hours. So, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up the costs: $200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"To find out how many emails James responds to, we first need to find out how many emails he doesn't respond to. 

20% of 80 emails is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails. 

Since James doesn't respond to these 16 emails, he responds to the rest. The rest of the emails are 80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Now, we need to find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week. Since he responds to 64 emails per day, in a 5-day work week, he responds to 64 * 5 = 320 emails.

The final answer is: 320"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we need to calculate the number of classes that visited each day and then add them up.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the number of classes that visited each day:
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 207

"To find the average score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the number of tests. 

John's scores are 100, 100, 100, and 80. 

First, let's add up the scores: 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380.

Next, we divide the total score by the number of tests: 380 / 4 = 95.

So, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95.

The final answer is: 95"
"To find the total number of pizzas left, we first need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by both the glee club and the football team.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 
70% of 20 is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 
They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

In total, they ate 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

So, the number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of big coupons. Since Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and he's sending out 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is 2 * 700 = 1400.

Now, let's calculate the cost of mailing small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, and there are 700 small coupons, so the total cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 = 3500 cents.

Next, let's calculate the cost of mailing big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, and there are 1400 big coupons, so the total cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 = 21000 cents.

Now, we add the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons together to find the total cost of postage. 3500 + 21000 = 23500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100. 23500 / 100 = 235 dollars.

The final answer is: $235"
"To find out how many meatballs were in the sub sandwiches that remained, we first need to determine how many meatballs Sidney initially ordered. 

Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, so Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches. 

Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, so Sidney initially had 7 * 4 = 28 meatballs.

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, which means he ate 4 * 4 = 16 meatballs.

After Mark ate 4 sub sandwiches, Sidney had 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches left. 

Sidney then ordered 3 more sub sandwiches, so he had a total of 3 + 3 = 6 sub sandwiches left.

The total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we first need to find out how many trucks were still operational after the mechanical failures. 

Mr Hezekiah had 20 trucks dispatched, and a quarter of them had mechanical failures. A quarter of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5. 

So, 20 - 5 = 15 trucks were still operational.

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 * 20 = 300 tons.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total cost of the butter, we first need to determine how much Dennis needs to buy. Since he needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

Since the grocery store has a promotion for buy one pound of butter get one half off, we can calculate the cost as follows:

- For the first pound of butter, the cost is $4.00.
- For the second pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).
- For the third pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).
- For the fourth pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).
- For the fifth pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).
- For the sixth pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).

The total cost of the butter is $4.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 = $12.00.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find the total cost of the party, we first need to determine the total number of guests. Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 dance class girls, and 13 family members, but 4 people said they couldn't come. 

Total invited guests = 25 (classmates) + 7 (dance class girls) + 13 (family members) = 45
Total guests attending = Total invited guests - 4 (those who couldn't come) = 45 - 4 = 41

Since the initial fee is for 20 guests, we need to find the number of additional guests. 

Additional guests = Total guests attending - 20 (initial guests) = 41 - 20 = 21

Now, we can calculate the total cost by adding the initial fee and the cost for the additional guests.

Total cost = Initial fee + (Additional guests * Cost per additional guest)
Total cost = $125 + (21 * $6)
Total cost = $125 + $126
Total cost = $251

The final answer is: $251"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has 3/4 of her money left. Since she had $60, we can set up the equation:

3/4 * x = 60

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 4/3:

x = 60 * (4/3)
x = 80

So Maggie had $80 initially.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she has 2/3 of her money left. Since she also had $60, we can set up the equation:

2/3 * y = 60

To solve for y, we multiply both sides by 3/2:

y = 60 * (3/2)
y = 90

So Riza had $90 initially.

Now, let's find out how much money they have left in total:

Maggie has 3/4 of $80, which is (3/4) * 80 = $60.
Riza has 2/3 of $90, which is (2/3) * 90 = $60.

The total amount of money they have left is $60 + $60 = $120.

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to determine how many bananas the first and second monkeys eat each day. 

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Since there are three monkeys in total, the total number of bananas they eat each day is 10 + 14 + x, where x is the number of bananas the third monkey eats. We know that the total number of bananas is 315, and they last for a week, which is 7 days. So, the total number of bananas eaten in a week is 315 * 7 = 2205.

However, we can also calculate the total number of bananas eaten in a week by adding the bananas eaten by each monkey in a day and multiplying it by 7. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day, so in a week, it eats 10 * 7 = 70 bananas. The second monkey eats 14 bananas each day, so in a week, it eats 14 * 7 = 98 bananas. 

Now, we know that the total number of bananas eaten in a week is 2205, and the first two monkeys eat 70 + 98 = 168 bananas in a week. The third monkey eats the rest of the bananas, which is 2205 - 168 = 2037 bananas in a week. 

Since there are 7 days in a week, the third monkey eats 2037 / 7 = 291 bananas each day.

The final answer is: 291"

So, the total number of pieces he placed is 250 + 500 = 750 pieces.

The final answer is: 750"
"To find out how much Jenny paid for the roses, we need to determine if she bought the roses by the dozen or individually. Since she bought 15 roses, it's more cost-effective for her to buy a dozen (12 roses) and 3 individual roses. 

A dozen roses cost $15, and 3 individual roses cost 3 * $2 = $6. So, the total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25. 

To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she paid with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

"To find out how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time interval between the first train's arrival and the fourth train's arrival.

The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the time Paul will board his train.

Since Paul is waiting at the station when the first train arrives, we need to calculate the time interval between the first train's arrival and the fourth train's arrival. The first train arrives at 10 minutes, and the fourth train arrives at 145 minutes. So, Paul will wait for 145 - 10 = 135 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks Melanie needs to save toothpicks, we first need to determine how many toothpicks she has saved so far. 

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week and has been doing so for 12 weeks. 

Number of toothpicks saved so far = 10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks in total, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs to save.

Number of toothpicks needed = 200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save 80 toothpicks at the rate of 10 toothpicks per week.

Number of weeks needed = 80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we first need to find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price, so the price he paid is 75% of $2000, which is 0.75 * 2000 = $1500.

Now, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is 1.2 * 1500 = $1800.

To find the discount percentage, we need to find the difference between the original price and the price at which Mr. Rogers' friend bought it, and then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100.

The discount percentage is ((2000 - 1800) / 2000) * 100 = (200 / 2000) * 100 = 10%.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours and then multiply it by the rate at which the springs create jellyfish.

There are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute. So, the total number of seconds in 4 hours is:

60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since each spring creates a new jellyfish every second, the total number of jellyfish created by one spring in 14400 seconds is 14400.

Now, if we have 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created in 14400 seconds is:

14400 * 5 = 72000

So, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

The final answer is: 72000"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score. Binkie's score is 90, so twice that would be 2 * 90 = 180.

Since Frankie's score is 15 better than twice Binkie's, we need to add 15 to the result. So, Frankie's score is 180 + 15 = 195.

The final answer is: 195"
"To find the total time James took to reach the store, we need to consider the round trip. 

First, let's find the total distance James walked. Since he walked halfway to the store and then back home, the total distance is 2 * 4 miles = 8 miles.

Now, we know James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find the total time, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed.

time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours

However, this is the total time for the round trip. Since James only wanted to know how long it took him to reach the store initially, we need to divide this time by 2.

time_to_reach_store = 2 hours / 2 = 1 hour

"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we first need to calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually and then compare it to the cost of buying them in bunches.

If Jenny buys 10 bunches with 4 bananas per bunch, she gets a total of 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

The cost of buying 10 bunches is $3.00 per bunch, so the total cost is 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

The difference in cost is $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

So, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much fence each person gets. Let's assume Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet of fence.

We know that the total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

- BMX bikes: 300 * 0.15 = 45
- MTB bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105

Now, let's calculate the revenue from each type of bike:
- Revenue from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- Revenue from BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250 (since BMX is half the price of MTB, which is $500, so BMX is $500 / 2 = $250)
- Revenue from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add up the revenue from all types of bikes:
$67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck, and then subtract the latter from the former.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer will make 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck will pick up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

Now, to find the number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the total number of bales made by the farmer: 30 - 18 = 12.

The number of bales of hay left in the field is 12."
"To find the total time John spends learning, we need to calculate the time spent in classes and the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday.

First, let's calculate the time spent in classes. John takes 2 extra classes, each 40 minutes long, 5 days a week. So, the total time spent in classes per week is:
2 classes/day * 40 minutes/class * 5 days/week = 400 minutes/week

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time spent in classes to hours:
400 minutes/week / 60 minutes/hour = 6.67 hours/week

Next, let's calculate the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday. John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time. There are 7 days in a week, so the total minutes in a week is:
7 days/week * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 1680 minutes/week

John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time:
(1/16) * 1680 minutes/week = 105 minutes/week

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the extra time to hours:
105 minutes/week / 60 minutes/hour = 1.75 hours/week

Now, we add the time spent in classes and the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday to get the total time spent learning:
6.67 hours/week + 1.75 hours/week = 8.42 hours/week

The final answer is: 8.42"
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is the height of the third floor, which is 24 feet.

On the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of the initial height, so the height after the first bounce is:
24 * (2/3) = 16 feet

On the second bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of the height after the first bounce, so the height after the second bounce is:
16 * (2/3) = 10.67 feet

The final answer is: 10.67"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child in inches. 

The first child is 6 feet tall, which is 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to determine the number of bags sold and then multiply it by the price per bag.

Since the orchard sold a total of 2000 apples and each bag contains 10 apples, we can find the number of bags sold by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:

Number of bags sold = Total apples / Apples per bag
= 2000 / 10
= 200

Now, we can find the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag:

Total earnings = Number of bags sold * Price per bag
= 200 * $5
= $1000

The final answer is: $1000"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

First, the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. Before that, the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left. So, the velociraptors ate half of (x - 270), where x is the total weight of the triceratops before the T-Rex ate. 

This can be represented as: (x - 270) / 2.

Now, the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, which is x / 2.

We know that the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, so the weight left after the velociraptors ate is 270 kilograms. 

So, we can set up the equation: (x - 270) / 2 = 270.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2: x - 270 = 540.

Now, we add 270 to both sides: x = 810.

The final answer is: 810"
"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted and then divide it by the coverage of a gallon of paint to find out how many gallons are needed. After that, we can multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon to get the total cost.

First, let's calculate the area of each wall:
- North wall: 10 x 8 = 80 square feet
- South wall: 10 x 8 = 80 square feet
- East wall: 5 x 8 = 40 square feet
- West wall: 5 x 8 = 40 square feet

Total area to be painted = 80 + 80 + 40 + 40 = 240 square feet

Since a gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, we need to divide the total area by the coverage of a gallon:
240 / 20 = 12 gallons

Now, we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon:
12 gallons * $12/gallon = $144

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to determine the probability of her choosing a shaken can out of the remaining cans.

Initially, there were 12 sodas. Ellen shook 3 of them, so 9 were unshaken. She took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken and 3 shaken sodas. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas.

Now, there are 2 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas. The total number of sodas is 8. The probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans: 2/8 = 0.25.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we add the distances they've traveled to find the total distance between them: 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we first need to determine the number of days he works. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until April 19th. So, the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th is 31 + 19 = 50 days.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50 days. To do this, we multiply 50 by 0.2: 50 * 0.2 = 10 days.

Now, we subtract the days off from the total number of days: 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

To find the total number of people he can help, we multiply the number of days he works by the number of people he can help per day: 40 * 6 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of people inside the church, we first need to calculate the total number of people that were transported by the buses and the cars. 

The number of people transported by the buses is the number of buses multiplied by the number of people each bus can carry: 12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people.

The number of people transported by the cars is the number of cars multiplied by the number of people each car can carry: 20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people.

The total number of people transported is the sum of the people transported by the buses and the cars: 420 people + 60 people = 480 people.

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the total number of people transported from the total number of people present (which is not given). However, we can assume that the total number of people present is the sum of the people transported and the people inside the church. Let's denote the number of people inside the church as x.

The equation becomes: x + 480 = total number of people present.

However, we cannot find the total number of people present from the given information. Therefore, we can only express the number of people inside the church in terms of the total number of people present.

But, if we assume that the total number of people present is the sum of the people transported and the people inside the church, we can express the number of people inside the church as x = total number of people present - 480.

But, since we cannot find the total number of people present, we cannot find the exact number of people inside the church."
"To find Jeff's age, we first need to determine Martha's age. Since Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can calculate Martha's age by subtracting 4 from Mike's age.

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now that we know Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age. Since Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, we can calculate Jeff's age by adding 10 to Martha's age.

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: 
Time = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide: 
Time = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, to find the difference in time, we subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide:
Difference in time = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 x 15-minute breaks per day. 
Total time spent per day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 2 x 15 minutes (breaks) = 30 + 30 = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60. 
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Now, we multiply the time spent per day by 5 to find the total time spent in 5 days.
1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours

The total time spent on lunch and breaks after 5 days is 5 hours."
"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can multiply 8 by 3.5 to find out how many miles Micah ran.

8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now that we know Micah ran 28 miles, we can subtract the total miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles run by all three to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

Total miles run by all three = 52 miles
Miles run by Amber = 8 miles
Miles run by Micah = 28 miles
Miles run by Ahito = Total miles run by all three - (Miles run by Amber + Miles run by Micah)
Miles run by Ahito = 52 - (8 + 28)
Miles run by Ahito = 52 - 36
Miles run by Ahito = 16 miles

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total amount she spent after returning the item and then add it to the initial charge.

1. Initial charge: $85.00
2. Return: -$15.00 (since she returned an item)
   New balance after return: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

3. Frying pan purchase: 20% off $20.00
   Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
   Price of frying pan: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

4. Towel purchase: 10% off $30.00
   Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
   Price of towels: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

5. Total amount spent after return: $70.00 (initial balance) + $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $113.00

The new balance on her credit card is: $113.00"
"Let's break down the information given:

- A fifth of the jellyfish are large. 
- A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light.
- The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue.
- When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5. 

A third of the large jellyfish change color, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue. Since the total number of jellyfish is x, the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. This means that the number of large jellyfish that change color (x/15) is equal to 6. 

So, we can set up the equation: x/15 = 6.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 15: x = 6 * 15 = 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find Caroline's age, we need to first find Ben's age, and then multiply it by 3.

We know Chris is 4 years old. Since Ben is two times older than Chris, we can find Ben's age by multiplying Chris's age by 2.

Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben's age, we can find Caroline's age by multiplying Ben's age by 3.

Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate Lauren's total savings required for retirement and then determine how many years she needs to work to achieve that.

First, let's calculate Lauren's annual expenses in retirement. Since she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, her annual expenses will be 0.4 * $100,000 = $40,000.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount Lauren needs to save for retirement. Assuming she will live for 20 years in retirement, we can use the formula for the present value of an annuity to calculate the total amount she needs to save:

Total Amount = Annual Expenses * Number of Years
Total Amount = $40,000 * 20
Total Amount = $800,000

However, this is the amount she needs to have at the start of retirement. Since she will be saving 20% of her salary each year, we need to calculate the present value of her future savings. We can use the formula for the present value of a growing annuity:

Present Value = Total Amount / (1 + r)^n

However, since we are trying to find the number of years, we will use the formula for the future value of a growing annuity instead:

FV = PMT * (((1 + r)^n - 1) / r)

Where:
FV = Future Value (Total Amount)
PMT = Annual Savings (20% of $100,000) = $20,000
r = Annual Interest Rate (we will assume 0% for simplicity, but in reality, this would be the interest rate on her savings account)
n = Number of Years

However, since we are trying to find the number of years, we will rearrange the formula to solve for n:

n = ln(FV / PMT) / ln(1 + r)

"To find the total population of the school, we can use the information given about the boys. Since 40% of the school population is 240 boys, we can set up the equation:

40% of total population = 240

To find the total population, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:

0.4 * total population = 240

Now, we can solve for the total population by dividing both sides by 0.4:

total population = 240 / 0.4
total population = 600

Now that we know the total population, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total population:

number of girls = total population - number of boys
number of girls = 600 - 240
number of girls = 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items before applying the coupon. 

The cost of the set of pots is $19, and the cost of the sack of garden soil is $26. 

Total cost before coupon = Cost of pots + Cost of soil
Total cost before coupon = $19 + $26
Total cost before coupon = $45

Now, we need to subtract the coupon value from the total cost before coupon to get the final amount spent.

Final amount spent = Total cost before coupon - Coupon value
Final amount spent = $45 - $7
Final amount spent = $38

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Since Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days, we can calculate her daily target by dividing the total miles by the number of days:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Soledad is planning to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is a total of 250 miles per day. To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we subtract her planned daily miles from her target daily miles:

310 miles per day - 250 miles per day = 60 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total amount the store will receive after selling all the balls, we need to calculate the total revenue from each color of balls and add them together.

The store has 3 red balls, and each red ball costs $9. So, the total revenue from red balls is 3 * $9 = $27.

The store has 11 blue balls, and each blue ball costs $5. So, the total revenue from blue balls is 11 * $5 = $55.

The store has 25 green balls, and each green ball costs $3. So, the total revenue from green balls is 25 * $3 = $75.

Now, let's add the revenue from all the balls together: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157.

The store will receive a total of $157 after selling all the balls.

"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the total amount he had initially, including the money he saved.

Raymond initially had $21. He saved $11, so now he has $21 + $11 = $32.

Then, he spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle, so the total amount he spent is $5 + $19 = $24.

Now, we subtract the amount he spent from the total amount he had: $32 - $24 = $8.

So, Raymond has $8 left.

The final answer is: $8"
"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first determine how much Anna spent in total. We know she had a budget of $16 and has $2 left, so she spent $16 - $2 = $14.

Since she spent $14 in total and bought 2 books that cost the same amount, we can divide the total amount spent by 2 to find the cost of each book. 

Cost of each book = Total amount spent / Number of books
Cost of each book = $14 / 2
Cost of each book = $7

The final answer is: $7"

"To find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we need to first find the rate at which the light blinks per minute. 

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. 

Rate = Total blinks / Total minutes 
Rate = 255 blinks / 5 minutes 
Rate = 51 blinks per minute 

Now, we can find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times by dividing the total blinks by the rate per minute.

Time = Total blinks / Rate 
Time = 459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute 
Time = 9 minutes

"To find the difference between the number of female and male fishes, we first need to calculate the total number of each type of fish after Tate's purchase.

Initially, there are:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfishes
- 5 female goldfishes

Tate buys:
- 2 male guppies
- 1 female guppy
- 2 male goldfishes
- 3 female goldfishes

So, the total number of each type of fish after the purchase is:
- Male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
- Female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of male and female fishes:
- Total male fishes: 6 (guppies) + 5 (goldfishes) = 11
- Total female fishes: 8 (guppies) + 8 (goldfishes) = 16

The difference between the number of female and male fishes is: 16 - 11 = 5

4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"To find the total distance John drives in a round trip, we need to calculate the distance for one way and then multiply it by 2.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles (one way)

Since it's a round trip, we multiply the one-way distance by 2:
Total Distance = 140 miles * 2
Total Distance = 280 miles

Since John visits his parents twice a month, we need to multiply the total distance by 2:
Total Distance per month = 280 miles * 2
Total Distance per month = 560 miles

The final answer is: 560"
"To find out how many miles Brian will walk in 7 days, we first need to determine how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we multiply 10 miles by 7 days.

10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we can set up an equation where Brian's distance is half of Sofie's distance. 

Let x be Brian's distance in 7 days. 
x = 70 miles / 2

x = 35 miles

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers and then find out how many toys the fifth worker must produce to meet the remaining demand.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour. Since there are 2 workers, their combined production rate is 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour. 

Next, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour. Since there are 2 workers, their combined production rate is 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour.

Now, let's add the production rates of the first 4 workers: 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

Since all 5 workers work for 10 hours, the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 20 * 10 = 200 toys.

The manufacturer still needs 20 toys to meet the order, so the fifth worker must produce these 20 toys in 10 hours. To find the production rate of the fifth worker, we divide the number of toys needed by the number of hours worked: 20 / 10 = 2 toys per hour.

"To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we first need to find the weight of each of his dogs. 

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/4 to find the weight of Elijah's first dog: 60 * 1/4 = 15 pounds.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/2 to find the weight of Elijah's second dog: 60 * 1/2 = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of Elijah's two dogs to find the total weight of his dogs: 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs: 45 + 60 = 105 pounds.

"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to calculate the total weight of the M&M's and then multiply it by the number of M&M's per ounce. 

First, let's find the total weight of the M&M's: 3 large bags * 10 ounces = 30 ounces.

Since an ounce of M&M's has 30 M&M's, the total number of M&M's is 30 ounces * 30 M&M's/ounce = 900 M&M's.

Now, we need to find out how many small bags John can make. Each small bag contains 10 M&M's, so we divide the total number of M&M's by 10: 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's/small bag = 90 small bags.

"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we first need to calculate half of the earth's circumference. 

Half of the earth's circumference is 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km.

Since Alfie flies 400 km every day, we can find the number of days it will take him to fly 20,000 km by dividing 20,000 km by 400 km/day.

20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days

Speed of the 2nd fastest car = 5 * 120 miles per hour = 600 miles per hour.

Now, we know the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. 

Speed of the fastest car = 1.25 * 600 miles per hour = 750 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 750"
"To find Vince's current age, we first need to find Liam's age two years ago. Since Liam is 16 now, two years ago he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince, so we can set up an equation: 14 = 2 * Vince's age two years ago.

To find Vince's age two years ago, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: Vince's age two years ago = 14 / 2 = 7.

Since Vince's age two years ago was 7, we add 2 to find his current age: Vince's current age = 7 + 2 = 9.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so let's call this number 'A'. 
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. 
   Let's call the number of eggs Sarah painted 'S'. Then, Camden painted S + 12 eggs.
   Since they painted a total of 30 eggs, we can write the equation: S + (S + 12) = 30
   Simplifying the equation, we get 2S + 12 = 30
   Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get 2S = 18
   Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 9
   So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.
3. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, 
   the total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline is 56 - 30 = 26.
   Since they painted the same number of eggs, each of them painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.
4. Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs. 
   The difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold is 21 - 13 = 8.

"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we first need to find the total number of boxes and the total weight of the crayons and boxes.

Since Nik wants to put the crayons into groups of 8, we can divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find the number of boxes: 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Since each box weighs 8 ounces and there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can find the weight of each box in pounds: 8 ounces / 16 ounces/pound = 0.5 pounds.

The total weight of the boxes is the number of boxes multiplied by the weight of each box: 25 boxes * 0.5 pounds/box = 12.5 pounds.

Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is the number of crayons multiplied by the weight of each crayon: 200 crayons * 1 ounce/crayon = 200 ounces.

To convert the total weight of the crayons to pounds, we divide by 16: 200 ounces / 16 ounces/pound = 12.5 pounds.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is the sum of the total weight of the boxes and the total weight of the crayons: 12.5 pounds + 12.5 pounds = 25 pounds.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much John makes, we first need to determine how many logs he can make from the tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we calculate 80% of 80 feet.

80% of 80 feet = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet long, we divide the total length of the usable tree by the length of each log to find the number of logs.

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

From each log, he cuts 5 planks. So, we multiply the number of logs by the number of planks per log.

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

He sells each plank for $1.2. To find the total amount he makes, we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we first need to find the individual salaries of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, and her brother earns 2 times that amount, so her brother earns $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so her salary is 2 * ($5000 + $10,000) = 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

Now, we can find the total amount of money they all have together by adding their individual salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Grandma's speed on the beach and on the sidewalk. 

Let's assume Grandma's speed on the beach is x miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she spends 40 minutes on the beach. 

The time taken to walk 2 miles on the beach is 2/x hours, which is equal to 40 minutes. We can convert this to hours by dividing by 60: 40/60 = 2/3 hours. 

Now, we can set up the equation: 2/x = 2/3. 

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 2 * 3 = 2x, which gives us 6 = 2x. 

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 3 miles per minute. 

Now that we know Grandma's speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk, which is 2x = 2 * 3 = 6 miles per minute.

The time taken to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is 1/6 hours, which is equal to 10 minutes.

The total time taken to walk 3 miles is the sum of the time taken on the beach and the time taken on the sidewalk: 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Jane to save a total of $60, we first need to calculate how much she has saved so far. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount saved is 4 * 8 = $32.

Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60. This is 60 - 32 = $28.

Since she saves $4 per week, we can find out how many weeks it will take her to save $28 by dividing 28 by 4. 

28 / 4 = 7.

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the number of marbles Bob initially has as 'x'. 

If he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 * 12 = 24. So, he receives 24 more marbles. 

Now, we can write the equation: x + 24 = 60. 

To find the initial number of marbles Bob has, we need to solve for 'x'. 

x + 24 = 60
x = 60 - 24
x = 36

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles.

Now, if he loses 10 marbles, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles.

Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle into his water bottle, the total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces. 

Since the temperature of the mixture is at least 40 degrees, we can set up the following equation:

(33 * 4 + x * 1) / 5 >= 40

Simplifying the equation:

132 + x >= 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x >= 68

So, the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of cows. Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 21 days in three weeks. 

Number of cows added in three weeks = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of cows = Initial number of cows + Number of cows added
Total number of cows = 50 + 420
Total number of cows = 470

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens. Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. 

Number of chickens added in three weeks = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
Total number of chickens = Initial number of chickens + Number of chickens added
Total number of chickens = 20 + 210
Total number of chickens = 230

Now, let's add the total number of cows and chickens to find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks.

Total number of animals = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens
Total number of animals = 470 + 230
Total number of animals = 700

"To find the cost of each single bagel, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels with the discount, and then divide that by the total number of bagels.

The cost of 4 packs of bagels without discount is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, the discount amount is 10% of $40.00, which is 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00.

The total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Each pack has 9 bagels, so 4 packs have 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

The cost of each single bagel is $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know he ate 5 less than 23 scoops, so we can write an equation for this:

Scoops = 23 - 5
Scoops = 18

Now, let's find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. We know it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops, so we can write an equation for this:

Potatoes per scoop = (6 - 3) / (3 - 1)
Potatoes per scoop = 3 / 2
Potatoes per scoop = 1.5

Now that we know how many potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop, we can find out how many potatoes Gomer ate in total. We can multiply the number of scoops by the number of potatoes per scoop:

Total potatoes = Scoops * Potatoes per scoop
Total potatoes = 18 * 1.5
Total potatoes = 27

"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, and then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days is 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester increases his egg consumption to 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days is 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

Now, we add the total number of eggs from both periods: 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens: 240 eggs / 12 = 20.

Total lemons per year = Number of trees * Lemons per tree per year
Total lemons per year = 5 * 6
Total lemons per year = 30

Now, we need to find the total number of lemons he collects in a decade. A decade has 10 years.

Total lemons in a decade = Total lemons per year * Number of years in a decade
Total lemons in a decade = 30 * 10
Total lemons in a decade = 300

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women on the bus initially. 

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can assume a common multiple for the ratio. Let's assume the common multiple is x. So, the number of men is 5x and the number of women is 9x.

We know the total number of passengers on the bus is 84. Therefore, the sum of men and women is 84. 

5x + 9x = 84
14x = 84
x = 6

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of women on the bus initially.
Number of women = 9x = 9 * 6 = 54

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining is:
54 - 20 = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we need to first determine how many bouquets he sold. We know that each bouquet has 12 sunflowers and costs $8. 

Faraday earned $56 from the bouquet per day. To find out how many bouquets he sold, we can divide the total earnings from bouquets by the cost of each bouquet: $56 / $8 = 7 bouquets per day.

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers sold from bouquets per day is 7 * 12 = 84 sunflowers.

Now, let's find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold individually per day. We know he earned $26 from sunflowers per day and each sunflower costs $2. To find out how many sunflowers he sold, we can divide the total earnings from sunflowers by the cost of each sunflower: $26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers per day.

Now, we need to find the total number of sunflowers sold per day. We add the number of sunflowers sold from bouquets and individually: 84 + 13 = 97 sunflowers per day.

To find the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days, we multiply the number of sunflowers sold per day by 3: 97 * 3 = 291 sunflowers.

The final answer is: 291"
"To find out how much money Adam loses, we first need to determine how many rocks he can buy with his $100. 

Since each rock costs $5, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of each rock: 

$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Adam sells 60% of his inventory, which is 60% of 20 rocks. To find 60% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.6:

20 * 0.6 = 12 rocks

Since Adam sells each rock for $7, we can find the total revenue by multiplying the number of rocks sold by the selling price:

12 rocks * $7/rock = $84

However, Adam's initial investment was $100, so we need to find out how much he would have made if he sold all the rocks. Since he sells each rock for $7 and has 20 rocks, we can multiply the number of rocks by the selling price:

20 rocks * $7/rock = $140

Now, we can find the total loss by subtracting the revenue from the initial investment:

$100 (initial investment) - $84 (revenue) = $16

However, we also need to consider the total potential revenue if Adam sold all the rocks, which is $140. Since he only sold 60% of the rocks, his actual revenue is $84. To find the loss, we need to subtract the actual revenue from the potential revenue:

$140 (potential revenue) - $84 (actual revenue) = $56

However, this is not the loss. The loss is the difference between the initial investment and the actual revenue. The actual revenue is $84, and the initial investment is $100. The loss is $16.

The final answer is: $16"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene. 

Let's first find the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene:

- Large-sized picture scenes: 45 / 5 = 9 days
- Medium-sized picture scenes: 36 / 6 = 6 days
- Small-sized picture scenes: 49 / 7 = 7 days

Now, we need to find the LCM of 9, 6, and 7. 

The prime factorization of 6 is 2 * 3
The prime factorization of 7 is 7
The prime factorization of 9 is 3^2

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:
LCM = 2 * 3^2 * 7 = 2 * 9 * 7 = 126

So, it will take Lauren 126 days to complete all the picture scenes.

"To find out how many eggs each child receives, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. 

First, let's determine the total number of eggs. Chatty prepared three dozen eggs. Since one dozen is equal to 12, three dozen would be 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, we have 36 eggs and 4 children. To find out how many eggs each child receives, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children: 36 / 4 = 9.

So, each child receives 9 eggs. 

9"
"To find out how much Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to calculate the total cost of food for a month. 

First, let's find out the daily cost of food for all the fish. Since Jen has 3 fish and each fish needs $1 worth of food a day, the total daily cost is 3 * $1 = $3.

Since May has 31 days, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days in May: $3 * 31 = $93.

So, Jen spends $93 on food for her fish in the month of May.

$93"
"To find out how many roses Patricia has now, we need to first determine how many roses she had after giving some to her mother. 

Initially, Patricia had 30 roses. She gave 24 roses to her mother, so we subtract 24 from 30 to find out how many roses she had left. 

30 - 24 = 6

Now, Patricia bought 15 more roses. To find out the total number of roses she has now, we add the 15 new roses to the 6 she already had.

6 + 15 = 21

So, Patricia now has 21 roses. 

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken. 

The total distance traveled is 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles.

The total time taken is 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

The average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time: 
Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 250 miles / 5 hours
Average speed = 50 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the individual probabilities of each ticket winning.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a decimal: 0.20.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 times the probability of the first ticket: 3 * 0.20 = 0.60.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the individual probabilities: 0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

1. Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, if we let x be the number of seashells Carlos collected, then Jim collected x + 5 seashells. We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, so we can set up the equation x + 5 = 27.

2. To find the number of seashells Carlos collected, we need to solve the equation x + 5 = 27. Subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation gives us x = 22. So, Carlos collected 22 seashells.

3. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. If we let y be the number of seashells Carrey collected, then we can set up the equation 2y = 22. To find the number of seashells Carrey collected, we need to solve for y. Dividing both sides of the equation by 2 gives us y = 11. So, Carrey collected 11 seashells.

4. Now that we know the total number of seashells each person collected, we can find the total number of seashells they gathered. Jim collected 27 seashells, Carlos collected 22 seashells, and Carrey collected 11 seashells. The total number of seashells is 27 + 22 + 11 = 60.

5. Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, we need to divide the total number of seashells by 3 to find out how many each person got. 60 / 3 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and add the number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday). So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 + 5 = 10.

Now, let's add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend: 20 + 10 = 30.

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. 

The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. 

60% of 5 minutes is 0.6 * 5 = 3 minutes. 

So, the second song is 5 + 3 = 8 minutes long.

Now, we add the lengths of both songs to find the total time of the cassette. 
Total time = 5 minutes (first song) + 8 minutes (second song) = 13 minutes.

"To find the total profit, we first need to calculate the profit from each device. 

The cost price of one device is $20, and the selling price is twice the cost price, which is 2 * $20 = $40.

The profit from one device is the selling price minus the cost price, which is $40 - $20 = $20.

Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday, so the total number of devices bought is 2 + 4 = 6.

The total profit is the profit from one device multiplied by the total number of devices, which is $20 * 6 = $120.

"To find the length of Carl's cane, we first need to determine Carl's height. We know that Isabel is 7 feet tall and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel. 

Isabel's height = 7 feet
Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
Ned's height = 7 - 2
Ned's height = 5 feet

Since Carl is one foot taller than Ned, we can find Carl's height by adding 1 foot to Ned's height.

Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 + 1
Carl's height = 6 feet

We are given that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. To find the length of the cane, we can divide Carl's height by 2.

Cane's length = Carl's height / 2
Cane's length = 6 / 2
Cane's length = 3 feet

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles required to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

Since each bottle covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, we need 100 / 20 = 5 bottles.

For 2300 people, we need 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, to find out how many more bottles it needs to produce, we subtract the number of bottles it can produce from the total number of bottles required: 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

The final answer is: 7300"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how many babies are wearing purple and blue. Since Carla has 8 babies and 3/4 of them are wearing purple, we can calculate the number of purple babies as follows:

Number of purple babies = 3/4 * 8 = 6

Similarly, the number of blue babies is:

Number of blue babies = 1/4 * 8 = 2

Now, let's find out how many babies are wearing bows. We know that all the blue babies and 1/3 of the purple babies are wearing bows. So, the number of purple babies wearing bows is:

Number of purple babies wearing bows = 1/3 * 6 = 2

The total number of babies wearing bows is the sum of blue babies and purple babies wearing bows:

Total number of babies wearing bows = 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This can be calculated as the number of purple babies wearing bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows, multiplied by 100:

Percentage chance = (2 / 4) * 100 = 50%

"To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday, and then subtract that result from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports received last week = 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

First, let's find the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday. 

Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Now, let's find the total number of reports received on Wednesday by subtracting the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday. However, we need to subtract the reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total reports received last week to get the reports received on Wednesday.

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received last week - (Reports received on Monday and Tuesday + Reports received on Thursday and Friday)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)

"To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the amount of money he earned from each sale and add them together.

First, Abraham sold half of his land for $50. Since he owns 80 square meters, half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. 

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Since he owns 80 square meters, 1/4 of that is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters. 

Now, let's calculate the amount of land he has left. He started with 80 square meters, sold 40 square meters, and then sold 20 square meters. So, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left.

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, the amount of money he earned from selling the remaining land is 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, let's add up the money he earned from each sale: $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

13 - 10 = 3.

Geb is 3 years old."
"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to first find out how many face masks he uses in a day. 

Since Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out and he goes out three times a day, the total number of face masks he uses in a day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, to find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses in a day by 2. 

6 * 2 = 12

So, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. Since a dozen is 12, we can calculate the total number of eggs as 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs, Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by each person: 5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden in the yard, we subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To find the total amount John makes in a week, we first need to determine the number of apartments in each complex and the total number of collections he makes in a week.

The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so the total number of apartments in these two complexes is 2 * 200 = 400.

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, which means it is 160% of the other two combined (100% + 60% = 160%). To find the number of apartments in the last complex, we multiply the total number of apartments in the first two complexes by 1.6 (which is the same as 160% or 160/100).

Number of apartments in the last complex = 400 * 1.6 = 640

Total number of apartments in all three complexes = 400 + 640 = 1040

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections he makes in a week is 3 * 3 = 9.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment, so the total amount he makes in a week is the total number of collections multiplied by the number of apartments and the pay per collection.

Total amount = 9 * 1040 * 0.40 = 3744

- In the 7th year, it produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- In the 8th year, it produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. First, we need to find out how many fruits a 10-year-old tree produces. Since a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, it produces 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits. So, an 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.
- In the 9th year, the tree doesn't produce any fruits.
- In the 10th year, it produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R. 

We are given that R = 4B and B = Y - 7. 

We also know that R + B + Y = 37.

Substituting R = 4B into the equation R + B + Y = 37, we get 4B + B + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5B + Y = 37.

Substituting B = Y - 7 into the equation 5B + Y = 37, we get 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37.

Expanding the equation 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37, we get 5Y - 35 + Y = 37.

Combining like terms in the equation 5Y - 35 + Y = 37, we get 6Y - 35 = 37.

Adding 35 to both sides of the equation 6Y - 35 = 37, we get 6Y = 72.

Dividing both sides of the equation 6Y = 72 by 6, we get Y = 12.

Now that we know Y = 12, we can find B by substituting Y into the equation B = Y - 7. B = 12 - 7 = 5.

Now that we know B = 5, we can find R by substituting B into the equation R = 4B. R = 4 * 5 = 20.

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume Ronnie was given $5. Since Rissa was given thrice as much, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

After each of them gave an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's call the amount they gave 'x'. So, Ronnie is left with 5 - x and Rissa is left with 15 - x.

We are given that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. This means 15 - x = (4/5) * 15.

To find the value of x, we can solve the equation: 
15 - x = (4/5) * 15
15 - x = 12
x = 3

Now that we know x, we can find out how much money Ronnie is left with:
Ronnie's money left = 5 - x

Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, which is the sum of the amounts of red, white, purple, and yellow paint. We can write this as an equation: x + x + x + 6 = 12.

Combine like terms: 3x + 6 = 12.

Subtract 6 from both sides: 3x = 6.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 2.

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, the amount of red paint used is x = 2 pints.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, we add the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house to get the total area of the house. 

Total area = 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. This means he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he is left with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which is 40 / 2 = 20 bills. So, he is left with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

Thomas then triples his money, which means he triples the number of bills. So, he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since each bill is now worth $20, he has 60 * 20 = 1200 dollars in 5 dollar bills.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals.

Now, let's find out how many goals team A scored in the second half. It's given that team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half. So, team A scores 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals in the second half.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team in the match. Team A scored 4 goals in the first half and 2 goals in the second half, so the total number of goals scored by team A is 4 + 2 = 6.

Team B scored 2 goals in the first half and 8 goals in the second half, so the total number of goals scored by team B is 2 + 8 = 10.

The total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by team A and team B, which is 6 + 10 = 16.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much chalk is left after Monday and then determine how many days it will last.

The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he uses 45% of it. 

45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

So, after Monday, 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk is left.

Since the teacher will be using 20% of the chalk each day from now on, we need to find out how many days it will take to use up the remaining 2.75 inches.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. 

The total chalk used in 'x' days will be 20% of 2.75 * x = 0.20 * 2.75 * x = 0.55x inches.

Since the teacher will recycle the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we need to find the number of days it will take to get to 2 inches.

2.75 - 0.55x = 2

Solving for 'x', we get:

0.55x = 2.75 - 2
0.55x = 0.75
x = 0.75 / 0.55
x = 1.36 (round up to the nearest whole number since we can't have a fraction of a day)

However, since the teacher will recycle the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we need to check if 0.55x is less than 2 when x = 1.

0.55 * 1 = 0.55 (which is less than 2)

So, the teacher will recycle the chalk after 1 day.

"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to find the total number of students on varsity. 

One-third of the girls are on varsity, so the number of girls on varsity is 12 * (1/3) = 4. 
One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so the number of boys on varsity is 12 * (1/4) = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 (boys) + 12 (girls) = 24.

The number of students not on varsity is 24 (total students) - 7 (students on varsity) = 17.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find out how many face masks Johnny bought, we first need to determine how many face masks Mike bought. Mike bought 5 face masks. 

Next, we need to calculate how many face masks Johnny bought, which is 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. To find thrice as many as Mike, we multiply the number of face masks Mike bought by 3. 

5 * 3 = 15

Then, we add 2 to this result to find out how many face masks Johnny bought.

15 + 2 = 17

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we first need to determine the total number of teeth the dentist worked on. The dentist drilled 4 teeth and capped 7 more than he drilled, so the number of teeth capped is 4 + 7 = 11.

The total number of teeth the dentist worked on is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15.

To find the percentage, we divide the number of teeth worked on by the total number of teeth and multiply by 100. 

(15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total cost of the milk that Mr. Marcellus purchased, we need to multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon. 

Total gallons = 4000
Cost per gallon = $3.5

Total cost = Total gallons * Cost per gallon
Total cost = 4000 * 3.5
Total cost = $14,000

Since 2/5 of the milk was expired, we need to find 2/5 of the total gallons to determine the amount that was returned.

Expired gallons = 2/5 * Total gallons
Expired gallons = 2/5 * 4000
Expired gallons = 1600

The refund amount will be the cost of the expired gallons.

Refund amount = Expired gallons * Cost per gallon
Refund amount = 1600 * 3.5
Refund amount = $5600

The final answer is: $5600"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Colin's current age as C and Wendy's current age as W.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:
20 = C

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we first need to determine the total number of books he can buy with $27000. 

Since he can buy 100 books for $500, we can find the total number of books he can buy by dividing the total amount he has ($27000) by the cost of 100 books ($500).

Total number of books = $27000 / $500 = 54

Now, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books he can buy per school.

Books per school = Total number of books / Number of schools
= 54 / 3
= 18

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's break down the sequence of events:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree.
2. Newton picked up 2 apples, put 1 in his pocket, and threw 1 back into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 1 apple in his pocket and 6 new apples (2 he picked up initially + 5 that fell out). Total apples = 7.
3. He put all but 1 of the 6 new apples in his pocket, so he has 1 apple left outside and 6 in his pocket. Total apples = 7 (in pocket) + 1 (outside) = 8.
4. He threw the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 6 apples in his pocket, 1 apple outside, and 6 new apples. Total apples = 6 (in pocket) + 1 (outside) + 6 (new) = 13.

So, Newton brought home 13 apples.

"To find the total cost of Ali's order, we need to calculate the total number of coal bags and multiply it by the cost per bag.

First, let's find the total number of coal bags:
Total coal in kilos = 850 kg
Weight of each bag = 50 kg
Number of bags = Total coal in kilos / Weight of each bag
= 850 kg / 50 kg
= 17 bags

Now, let's find the total cost:
Cost per bag = $18
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
= 17 bags * $18
= $306

The final answer is: $306"
"To find out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza is needed for. 

For the cheese pizza, each friend eats 6 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of cheese pizza slices needed is 6 friends * 6 slices/friend = 36 slices. 

For the pepperoni pizza, each friend eats 4 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices needed is 6 friends * 4 slices/friend = 24 slices.

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to find out how many whole pizzas of each type Kate needs to buy. 

For the cheese pizza, we need 36 slices / 12 slices/pizza = 3 pizzas. 

For the pepperoni pizza, we need 24 slices / 8 slices/pizza = 3 pizzas.

Since Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, she needs a total of 3 + 3 = 6 pizzas.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total miles Sam ran this week, we need to calculate the miles run on each day and add them up.

Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Since there are 3 days, the total miles run on these days is 3 * 3 = 9 miles.

Sam ran 5 miles on Tuesday and Thursday. Since there are 2 days, the total miles run on these days is 5 * 2 = 10 miles.

Now, we add the miles run on both sets of days: 9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles.

The final answer is: 19"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the net rate at which Jay is building snowballs. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 20 / 60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute. 

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, so the rate at which snowballs melt is 2 / 15 = 2/15 snowballs per minute.

The net rate at which Jay is building snowballs is the difference between the rate at which he builds them and the rate at which they melt. 

Net rate = (1/3) - (2/15) = (5/15) - (2/15) = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Now, we need to find the time it takes for Jay to build 60 snowballs at a rate of 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Time = Total number of snowballs / Net rate = 60 / (1/5) = 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Jay 300 minutes to have 60 snowballs.

"To find Jim's age, we need to first determine John's age 20 years ago. Since John is 28 now, we subtract 20 from his current age to find his age at the time of the Digimon release.

John's age 20 years ago = 28 - 20 = 8

Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we can set up an equation to find Jim's age at that time:

John's age 20 years ago = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago
8 = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago

To find Jim's age 20 years ago, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Jim's age 20 years ago = 8 / 2
Jim's age 20 years ago = 4

Now, we need to find Jim's current age by adding 20 to his age 20 years ago:

Jim's current age = Jim's age 20 years ago + 20
Jim's current age = 4 + 20
Jim's current age = 24

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Doxa ate 1 slice of the apple. 
Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices eaten by each of them: 
Doxa ate 1 slice, her sister ate 2 slices, and her brother ate 3 slices. 
So, the total number of slices eaten is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as 'x'. 

On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50. So, the remaining bandages after the first day are x - 38.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The remaining bandages after the second day are (x - 38) - 28.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. The remaining bandages after the third day are ((x - 38) - 28) - 25 + 100.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation:

((x - 38) - 28) - 25 + 100 = 78

Simplifying the equation:

x - 38 - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78
x - 91 + 100 = 78
x + 9 = 78
x = 69

The initial number of bandages they started with on the first day is 69.

The final answer is: 69"

"To find Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her regular pay and the attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay. She works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. Since there are 4 weeks in April, we need to find the total number of working days in April. 

There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks will have 4 * 7 = 28 days. Since she works 6 days a week, she will work 28 * 6 = 168 days in April.

Now, let's calculate her total hours worked in April. She works 7.5 hours a day, so her total hours worked in April will be 168 * 7.5 = 1260 hours.

Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her regular pay will be 1260 * $1.5 = $1890.

Now, let's calculate her attendance bonus. She receives an additional $10 for complete attendance, and since she did not incur any absences for April, she will receive the bonus for all 28 days. So, her attendance bonus will be 28 * $10 = $280.

Now, let's add her regular pay and attendance bonus to find her total earnings for April. 

$1890 + $280 = $2170

The final answer is: $2170"

Since Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens and each pack has 5 pens, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

It's given that she bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. So, the number of black pens is 2 * 25 = 50 black pens.

To find the total number of pens, we add the number of red pens and black pens: 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

The final answer is: 75"
"To find the total amount John spent, we first need to determine the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. So, the cost per bottle of scotch is $600 / 10 = $60.

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of cognac per bottle is 50% more than the cost of scotch per bottle. 50% of $60 is $30, so the cost of cognac per bottle is $60 + $30 = $90.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total amount John spent is the sum of the cost of scotch and cognac: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. He also planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which means he planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it a total of 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day. Since he planted 40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day, 1/4 of that is 40 * 1/4 = 10. So, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

To find the total number of trees planted in the two days, we need to add the number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees planted on both days. 

Total White Oak trees = 20 (first day) + 10 (second day) = 30
Total Lodgepole Pine trees = 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90

Total number of trees = Total White Oak trees + Total Lodgepole Pine trees = 30 + 90 = 120

"To find out how much root beer was available for each person to drink, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer remaining after all the incidents.

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed by his children, so the remaining amount is 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, so the remaining amount is 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.

On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed by Ronnie, so the remaining amount is 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, and they shared the remaining root beer equally. To find out how much each person got, we need to divide the remaining amount by 3 (Fred and the 2 other people).

The remaining amount is 8 gallons, and there are 3 people (including Fred) to share it. 

8 / 3 = 2.67 gallons.

So, each person got approximately 2.67 gallons of root beer to drink during the party.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as 'x'. 

The problem states that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as an equation: 4x + 8 = 40.

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable 'x'. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation: 4x = 40 - 8.

This simplifies to: 4x = 32.

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for 'x': x = 32 / 4.

x = 8.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 eyeshadow colors each, so she had a total of 3 * 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister steals one of the palettes, which means Amy loses 4 eyeshadow colors. So, she now has 26 - 4 = 22 eyeshadow colors.

Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which has 6 eyeshadow colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she uses up 3 eyeshadow colors from the makeup set.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we first need to find the total height of the house and the height of the first floor.

Mattison's height is 60 inches. The house is 7 times as high as he is, so the total height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, so the height of the first floor is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Since the total height of the house is 420 inches and the first floor is 180 inches, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is the same as the height of the first floor, which is 180 inches.

"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we first need to find the capacity of John's school. 

Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we can find the capacity of one of John's classes by multiplying Ali's class capacity by 1/8.

Capacity of one of John's classes = 120 * (1/8) = 15 students

Since John has two classes, we multiply the capacity of one class by 2 to find the total capacity of John's school.

Capacity of John's school = 15 * 2 = 30 students

Now, we add the capacity of Ali's school (which is 120 students) to the capacity of John's school to find the combined capacity of both schools.

Combined capacity = 120 + 30 = 150

The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the jar) is given by the formula V = lwh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.

Given that the base is square, the length and width are the same, so we can use the formula V = s^2h, where s is the side length of the square base.

V = s^2h
V = 6^2 * 15
V = 36 * 15
V = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans have an efficiency of 80%, we need to divide the volume of the jar by 0.8 to get the total volume that can be occupied by the jelly beans.

Total volume for jelly beans = 540 / 0.8
Total volume for jelly beans = 675 cubic inches

Since each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, we can divide the total volume for jelly beans by the volume of a single jelly bean to get the total number of jelly beans.

Total number of jelly beans = 675 / 0.15
Total number of jelly beans = 4500

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3 to get the number of red jelly beans.

Number of red jelly beans = 4500 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 1350

However, we are given that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we need to know what his guess was. Since we don't have that information, we can't calculate the exact difference. But we can calculate the ratio of the true number of red jelly beans to the estimated number of red jelly beans.

Ratio = True number of red jelly beans / Estimated number of red jelly beans
Ratio = 900 / 1350
Ratio = 0.6667

This means that Tim's guess was 1/1.5 or 2/3 of the true number of red jelly beans."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. 

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 of 40 is (3/4) * 40 = 30. So, 30 people entered the bus at the second stop. The total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the remaining spaces, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost for the first 5 years and the cost for the next 3 years separately and then add them together.

For the first 5 years, Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year. The initial cost of one visit is $2. So, the total cost for the first 5 years is:
3 visits/year * $2/visit * 5 years = $30/year * 5 years = $150

The cost of one visit increases by 150% after 5 years. This means the new cost of one visit is 2 + (2 * 1.5) = $6.

For the next 3 years, Pauline still visits the museum 3 times a year. The new cost of one visit is $6. So, the total cost for the next 3 years is:
3 visits/year * $6/visit * 3 years = $18/year * 3 years = $54

Now, we add the cost for the first 5 years and the cost for the next 3 years:
$150 + $54 = $204

The final answer is: $204"
"To find out how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to determine the total number of groups required and then multiply that by the time it takes for each group to try the escape room.

There are 4 grades (4-7) with 10 students in each grade, so the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40.

Since only the top 10 students in each grade get to try the escape room, we need to find the total number of students who will try the escape room. Since there are 4 grades, we need to find the total number of students who will try the escape room in each grade, which is 10. 

However, since there are 40 students in total and only 10 can try the escape room at a time, we need to find the total number of groups required. We can do this by dividing the total number of students by the number of students per group, which is 40 / 10 = 4.

Since each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room, we multiply the number of groups by the time per group to get the total time required. 

4 groups * 45 minutes per group = 180 minutes

The final answer is: 180"
"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the wooden tables and the roof frames separately and then add them together.

The cost of the wooden tables is 4 tables * $20 per table = $80.
The cost of the roof frames is 2 frames * $10 per frame = $20.

Now, let's add the cost of the tables and the roof frames together: $80 + $20 = $100.

So, Ali has to pay John $100. 

The final answer is: $100"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's assume the length of the shorter piece is x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. So, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet. 

We can write an equation to represent this: x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms: 5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5: x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet, we can find the length of the longer piece by multiplying 8 by 4: 4x = 4(8) = 32

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound to find the total pounds of meat needed.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Now that we know Aiden needs 5 pounds of ground beef, we can find out how much seasoning he needs. He adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat.

Total pounds of meat needed = 5
Seasoning per pound = 2 tablespoons

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat needed * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2
Total seasoning needed = 10

"To find the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the width of one window by the total number of windows. 

Width of one window = 35 inches
Number of windows = 5

Total width of windows = Width of one window * Number of windows
Total width of windows = 35 * 5
Total width of windows = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the total width by 2.

Fabric needed = 2 * Total width of windows
Fabric needed = 2 * 175
Fabric needed = 350 inches

The final answer is: 350"
"To find the total cost of the call, we need to calculate the cost for the first 16 minutes and the cost for the remaining minutes. 

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is 16 * $0.25 = $4. 

For the remaining 20 minutes (36 - 16 = 20), the cost is 20 * $0.2 = $4.

The total cost is $4 + $4 = $8.

"Let's break down the information given. Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. If we let the number of cupcakes be 'c', then the number of brownies is 3c - 2.

Since each person gets 2 treats and there are 5 people in the class, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, so we can write the equation: c + (3c - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4c - 2 = 10.

Add 2 to both sides: 4c = 12.

Divide by 4: c = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount. 

The original cost of both manicure and pedicure is $35 + $40 = $75. 

The 20% discount on $75 is 0.20 * $75 = $15. 

So, the discounted cost of both manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers in total (5 on each hand), the cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted cost of manicure and pedicure plus the cost of nail art, which is $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the total number of magazines Susan receives each year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them up.

The first 3 magazines send 12 issues a year, so that's 3 * 12 = 36 issues.

The second magazine sends 6 issues a year.

The third magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, which is 4 * 6 = 24 issues.

Now, let's add up the total number of issues: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

So, Susan receives 66 magazines every year.

The final answer is: 66"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

We know that Samantha has 27 paintings. Since Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, we can represent the number of Shelley's paintings as 27 + 12 = 39.

Now, we know that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. So, we can represent the number of Kim's paintings as 39 - 8 = 31.

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

"To find the price of the toy after the discount in January, we need to calculate the price after the increase in December and then apply the decrease in January.

The initial price of the toy in November is $40.

In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we multiply the initial price by 1.8 (100% + 80% = 180%, or 1 + 0.8 = 1.8).

Price in December = $40 * 1.8 = $72

In January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we multiply the price in December by 0.5 (100% - 50% = 50%, or 1 - 0.5 = 0.5).

Price in January = $72 * 0.5 = $36

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the amount he earns from the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons separately and then add them together.

For the standard rate lessons, Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 per hour. So, the total amount he earns from these lessons is:
4 * $80 = $320

For the reduced rate lessons, Charlie has 2 lessons at a 25% discount on the standard rate. The reduced rate is 75% of the standard rate, which is 0.75 * $80 = $60 per hour. So, the total amount he earns from these lessons is:
2 * $60 = $120

Now, we add the amounts earned from both types of lessons to find the total amount Charlie will make for the day:
$320 + $120 = $440

The final answer is: $440"
"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and then divide by the total number of scores.

First, let's add up all the scores: 
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

The sum of all the scores is 630.

Next, we need to count the total number of scores, which is 9.

Now, we divide the sum by the total number of scores to find the mean:
630 / 9 = 70

"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to first determine what 1/4 of the original amount is. 

Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos. 1/4 of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5. 

Since Eve is left with 1/4 of the original amount, she must have given away the remaining 3/4 of the pomelos. 

To find out how many pomelos she gave away, we multiply the original amount by 3/4: 20 * (3/4) = 20 * 3 / 4 = 60 / 4 = 15.

So, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total amount of money Walter received, we need to calculate the number of apples he had left after eating and giving some to his sister, and then multiply that by the price per apple.

First, Walter ate 2/5 of the 60 apples. To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and divide by 5:
60 * 2 = 120
120 / 5 = 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, we subtract 24 from the total number of apples to find the remaining number:
60 - 24 = 36

Walter then gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. To find 25% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.25:
36 * 0.25 = 9

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples. Now, we subtract 9 from the remaining number to find the number of apples he had left:
36 - 9 = 27

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find the total amount of money he received, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple:
27 * 3 = 81

"To find the total number of novels Regina wrote this year, we need to determine the total number of novels she wrote last year and then multiply it by 4 (since 3 quarters is equivalent to 3/4, and to find the whole, we multiply by 4/3).

Let's start by finding the total number of novels she wrote last year. We know she wrote 9 novels last year.

Now, we multiply 9 by 4 to find the total number of novels she wrote this year.

9 * 4 = 36

So, Regina has written 36 novels this year."
"To find the distance covered by Michael in 3 days, we need to calculate the total distance he travels in that time. 

First, let's convert the time from days to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3 days is equal to 3 * 24 = 72 hours.

Now, we can multiply the average speed by the total time to find the distance traveled: 
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hr
Distance = 3600 km

Now, we can find the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered:
Percentage = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage = 0.6 * 100
Percentage = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass, so he used 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Each pie requires 12 grapes, so the total number of grapes used by their mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by all three is 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

Let's denote the initial number of grapes as x. Since 84 grapes were used, the initial number of grapes is x - 84.

We know that the initial number of grapes is at least 84, since we can't have a negative number of grapes. So, x - 84 ≥ 0.

To find the minimum number of grapes at the beginning, we can set up the equation x - 84 = 0 and solve for x.

x = 84

However, this is the minimum number of grapes, and we need to find the total number of grapes at the beginning. Since we don't have any information about the remaining grapes after Madeline ate 6 grapes, we can assume that the initial number of grapes is a multiple of 6 (since Madeline ate 6 grapes). 

The least common multiple of 6 and 84 is 84. Therefore, the initial number of grapes is 84.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total number of teachers at school that day, we need to add the number of teachers who were sick and the number of substitute teachers.

"To find the total cost of making macaroni and cheese, we need to calculate the cost of the pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese.

The cost of the pasta is $1.00 per box. Since Bud makes it once a week, he buys 52 boxes in a year (52 weeks). So, the total cost of pasta is 52 * $1.00 = $52.00.

The cost of cheddar cheese is $3.00. Since Bud makes it once a week, he spends $3.00 * 52 = $156.00 on cheddar cheese in a year.

The cost of gruyere cheese is twice the cost of cheddar cheese, which is $3.00 * 2 = $6.00. Since Bud makes it once a week, he spends $6.00 * 52 = $312.00 on gruyere cheese in a year.

Now, let's add up the total cost of pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese: $52.00 + $156.00 + $312.00 = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520.00"
"To find the total number of classrooms the custodian needs to clean, we already know that number is 80. 

The custodian has 5 days to clean the classrooms. We need to find out how many minutes they have to clean in total. Since they work 8 hours a day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, they work 8 * 60 = 480 minutes per day.

In 5 days, they work a total of 5 * 480 = 2400 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes they spend cleaning per classroom. It takes them 15 minutes per classroom.

To find the total time spent cleaning, we multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom: 80 * 15 = 1200 minutes.

Now, we need to find the percentage of their day spent cleaning. To do this, we divide the total time spent cleaning by the total time available and multiply by 100: (1200 / 2400) * 100 = 50%.

"To solve this problem, let's first determine the capacity of each shelf. 

Let's denote the capacity of a middle shelf as 'x'. Since the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, its capacity is 2x. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so its capacity is 2x - 5.

We know that each of the middle shelves can hold 10 books. Therefore, x = 10.

Now, let's calculate the capacity of each shelf:
- Middle shelf: 10 books
- Bottom shelf: 2x = 2 * 10 = 20 books
- Top shelf: 2x - 5 = 2 * 10 - 5 = 15 books

The total capacity of a single bookcase is the sum of the capacities of all its shelves: 10 + 20 + 15 = 45 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to find out how many bookcases she needs to hold all of them. To do this, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of a single bookcase: 110 / 45.

110 / 45 = 2.44

Since we can't have a fraction of a bookcase, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Elly needs 3 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"To find Rose's profit, we first need to calculate the total cost price and the total selling price of the eggs.

The cost price of 5 dozens of eggs is $2.40 per dozen. Since 1 dozen = 12 eggs, 5 dozens = 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

Cost price of 60 eggs = 5 * $2.40 = $12

Now, let's find the selling price of 60 eggs. Rose sells 3 eggs for $1. So, the selling price of 60 eggs = (60 / 3) * $1 = $20

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price.

Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = $20 - $12
Profit = $8

"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we first need to calculate the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

Original price per bag: $18.00
Discount: $3.00
Discounted price per bag: $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can find the cost per stick by dividing the discounted price by the number of sticks.

Cost per stick: $15.00 / 30 sticks = $0.50 per stick

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100 (since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents).

Cost per stick in cents: $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents

"To find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to determine the total number of questions she needs to get right overall. 

The total number of questions in both tests is 70 + 40 = 110. To pass, she needs to get 70% of 110 questions correct. 

70% of 110 is 0.7 * 110 = 77. So, Audrey needs to get 77 questions correct overall.

She got 60% of the first test correct, which is 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions. 

To find out how many questions she needs to get right on the second test, we subtract the number of questions she got right on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to get right: 77 - 42 = 35.

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as 's' and the number of blueberry cubes as 'b'. We are given that the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so we can write an equation:

b = 5s - 4

We are also given that the total number of ice cubes is 116, which is the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes:

s + b = 116

Substituting the expression for b from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6s - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6s = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

s = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting s into the first equation:

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the family, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Next, let's calculate the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of 8 rooms is 4. So, 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, which is 4 * 4 = 16 small candles. The other 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each, which is 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles. 

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Now, we add the number of flashlights and the number of candles together: 4 flashlights + 36 candles = 40.

"To find out how many calls Tim deals with in a day, we need to divide the total hours he spends at work by the time it takes to deal with a call. 

First, let's convert the time it takes to deal with a call from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 15 minutes is 15/60 = 0.25 hours.

Now, let's divide the total hours Tim spends at work by the time it takes to deal with a call: 6 hours / 0.25 hours per call = 24 calls per day.

Since Tim works for 5 days a week, we multiply the number of calls he deals with in a day by the number of days he works: 24 calls per day * 5 days per week = 120 calls per week.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total time it takes for the coat of varnish to dry on 6 paintings with the old varnish, we multiply the time it takes for one painting by the number of paintings: 7 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 42 minutes.

To find the total time it takes for the coat of varnish to dry on 6 paintings with the new varnish, we multiply the time it takes for one painting by the number of paintings: 12 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 72 minutes.

Now, we need to find the difference in time between the two scenarios. We subtract the time it takes with the old varnish from the time it takes with the new varnish: 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes.

So, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total amount of water Crista needs, we need to calculate the water required for each type of plant and add them up.

4 plants need half a cup of water each, so the total water required for these plants is 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups.

8 plants need 1 cup of water each, so the total water required for these plants is 8 * 1 = 8 cups.

The rest of the plants are 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 plants. These plants need a quarter of a cup of water each, so the total water required for these plants is 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.

Now, let's add up the water required for all the plants: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total time it takes for Phineas to cover the distance on land and in water. 

First, we need to find the distance Phineas needs to cover on land and in water. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, Phineas needs to cover 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

Time taken to cover the distance on land = Distance / Speed
Time taken to cover the distance on land = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

Time taken to cover the distance in water = Distance / Speed
Time taken to cover the distance in water = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Total time taken to return home = Time taken on land + Time taken in water
Total time taken to return home = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total cost, we first need to determine how many boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs to buy. Since he needs 56 popsicle sticks and each box contains 8 sticks, we can divide 56 by 8 to find the number of boxes needed.

56 ÷ 8 = 7

So, Bob needs 7 boxes of popsicle sticks. Since each box costs $2.00, we can multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box to find the total cost.

7 boxes * $2.00 per box = $14.00

Therefore, it will cost Bob $14.00 to build his project.

The final answer is: $14.00"
"To find the total cost of the phone plan, we need to determine the cost of the additional phones and add it to the cost of the main phone.

Let's assume the cost of each additional phone is x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We know that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

The total cost of the phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones:

Total cost = 20 + 40
Total cost = 60

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in a day and then multiply it by the number of days in June.

Since Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day, and 1 dozen is equal to 12, he makes 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.

The price of each doughnut is $2. So, the total amount of money Derrick makes in a day is 120 * $2 = $240.

June has 30 days. Therefore, the total amount of money Derrick makes in June is $240 * 30 = $7200.

The final answer is: $7200"
"To find out how many days Jade needs to upload all her photos, we need to divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she can upload in a day.

First, let's find out how many photos Jade can upload in a day. She uploads 6 batches of 7 photos each day, so the total number of photos she can upload in a day is 6 * 7 = 42.

Now, let's divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she can upload in a day: 210 / 42 = 5.

So, Jade will need 5 days to upload all her photos. 

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how much Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks, we need to calculate the total cost for each week and then multiply it by 5.

For 1 week:
- Cost of blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00 per blouse = $25.00
- Cost of pants: 2 pants * $8.00 per pair = $16.00
- Cost of skirt: 1 skirt * $6.00 per skirt = $6.00
- Total cost for 1 week: $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00

$47.00 * 5 = $235.00

The final answer is: $235.00"
"To find the new speaking speed of John after training, we need to multiply his original speed by 2.5. 

Original speed = 150 WPM
New speed = 2.5 * 150 WPM = 375 WPM

Now, we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so:

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words/page = 4500 words

Now, we can find the time it would take John to speak 4500 words at his new speed:

Time = Total words / New speed
Time = 4500 words / 375 WPM

To convert this to minutes, we need to divide by 60 (since there are 60 words in a minute):

Time = (4500 / 375) / 60
Time = 12 minutes

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the total number of people he saw on the first three days and add it to the total number of people he saw on the remaining days.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the number of people on the second day is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day, so the number of people on the third day is 2 * 70 = 140.

The total number of people on the first three days is 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, the total number of people he saw on the remaining days is 60 * 4 = 240.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 260 + 240 = 500.

The final answer is: 500"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop. 

In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.

In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to four times the initial rate, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, which is 0.5 * 80 = 40 kernels.

So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 120 seconds is 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels.

After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. This is 0.25 * 40 = 10 kernels.

The total number of kernels that popped is 200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

The final answer is: 210"
"To find out how many lemons Tim will need, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemonade he needs to make, including the extra gallon for Allen. 

Since Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade and 1 extra gallon, he will need to make a total of 5 gallons. 

Since 1 cup of lemon juice is required for 1 gallon of lemonade, and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the total amount of lemon juice needed. 

5 gallons * 1 cup/gallon = 5 cups of lemon juice

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the total number of lemons needed.

5 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 30 lemons

However, we also need to consider the extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart as the other gallons. This means it will require twice the amount of lemon juice. 

So, for the extra gallon, we need 2 cups of lemon juice. 

Total lemon juice needed for the extra gallon = 2 cups

Total lemon juice needed for the other 4 gallons = 5 cups

Total lemon juice needed = 2 cups + 5 cups = 7 cups

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the total number of lemons needed.

7 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 42 lemons

Therefore, Tim will need 42 lemons.

The final answer is: 42"
"To find the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we need to calculate the daily consumption of both breeds and then multiply it by 7.

The German Shepherds consume 5 kilograms each per day, and there are 3 of them. So, their daily consumption is 5 * 3 = 15 kilograms.

The Bulldogs consume 3 kilograms each per day, and there are 2 of them. So, their daily consumption is 3 * 2 = 6 kilograms.

The total daily consumption is the sum of the consumption of both breeds: 15 + 6 = 21 kilograms.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 21 * 7 = 147 kilograms.

Therefore, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week.

"To find the total number of animal legs, we need to calculate the total number of legs from both 2-legged and 4-legged animals.

For 2-legged animals: 10 animals * 2 legs per animal = 20 legs
For 4-legged animals: 15 animals * 4 legs per animal = 60 legs

Now, let's add the total number of legs from both types of animals: 20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs

Since we want to find the number of pairs of animal legs, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2: 80 legs / 2 = 40 pairs of legs

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the number of red blocks, we first need to determine the total number of blue and yellow blocks. We know there are 4 blue blocks and twice as many yellow blocks, so the number of yellow blocks is 4 * 2 = 8.

The total number of blue and yellow blocks is 4 + 8 = 12. 

Since the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, the number of red blocks can be found by subtracting the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks: 32 - 12 = 20.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by Elvis in both directions and then find the remaining distance from his house.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the west direction. Distance = Speed * Time. 
Distance = 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles.

Now, Elvis turns around and travels east for 8 hours at the same speed. 
Distance = 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles.

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the net distance from his house. 
Net distance = Distance traveled east - Distance traveled west = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles.

So, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house now.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and subtract it from the initial value.

Initial value of the boat = $9000

Depreciation in the first year = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after the first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Depreciation in the second year = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after the second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Depreciation in the third year = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after the third year = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The final value of the boat after three years is $3528.

The final answer is: $3528"
"To find the number of pink candies, we first need to determine the number of orange and yellow candies. 

We know there are 54 red candies. Since there are twice as many orange candies as red candies, the number of orange candies is 2 * 54 = 108.

We also know there are half as many yellow candies as red candies, so the number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, we can find the total number of non-pink candies by adding the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

Since there are 232 candies in total, the number of pink candies is 232 - 189 = 43.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel and the cost of the bus trips separately and then add them together.

The cost of the hotel for 3 nights is 3 * $80 = $240.

The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel, which is 0.1 * $80 = $8.

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus trips is 7 * $8 = $56.

The total cost of the hotel and bus travels is $240 + $56 = $296.

The final answer is: $296"
"To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we first need to determine how many marbles Dallas received. We know that Dallas had 21 marbles after dropping 4, so he must have had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles initially.

Since Mazie gave the twins a total of 52 marbles, and Dallas had 25, we can find out how many marbles Darla received by subtracting Dallas's marbles from the total.

Darla's marbles = Total marbles - Dallas's marbles
Darla's marbles = 52 - 25
Darla's marbles = 27

"To find the total weight of the car, luggage, and children, we need to add the individual weights together. 

Total weight = weight of car + weight of luggage + weight of children
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + (2 * 75)
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we need to calculate 1% of 1600.

Force required = 1% of 1600
Force required = (1/100) * 1600
Force required = 0.01 * 1600
Force required = 16 pounds

"To find the total length of crepe paper James needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of the backyard fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width).

Given the length of the fence is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2 * 35
Perimeter = 70

So, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to hang around the entire fence.

"To find out how much feed is left after a week, we first need to calculate how much feed the pigs eat in a day and then multiply it by 7 to get the weekly consumption.

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so the total feed consumed by one pig in a day is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

Since Dexter has 5 pigs, the total feed consumed by all pigs in a day is 8 * 5 = 40 pounds.

Now, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 to get the weekly consumption: 40 * 7 = 280 pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so to find out how much is left, we subtract the weekly consumption from the total ordered: 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, the total cost of the T-shirts would be 2 * $8 = $16. However, since there's a buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake only pays for one T-shirt at the original price and the other one at 50% off. So, the cost of the first T-shirt is $8 and the cost of the second T-shirt is $8 * 0.5 = $4. The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and Jake gets a 40% discount. The discount amount is $40 * 0.4 = $16. So, the cost of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store. The total cost is $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find out how much money Ryan has, we need to calculate his total earnings from doing chores and then subtract the cost of the ice cream cones.

Ryan earns $6 each week for 3 weeks, so his total earnings are 6 * 3 = $18.

He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each, so the total cost of ice cream cones is 4 * 1.25 = $5.

Now, let's subtract the cost of ice cream cones from his total earnings: 18 - 5 = $13.

The cost of a movie ticket is $6.50. To find out how many tickets Ryan can buy, we need to divide his remaining money by the cost of a ticket: 13 / 6.50 = 2.

So, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets.

"To find the total amount spent by Ellen and Lani, we need to calculate the total amount spent by each of them separately and then add them together.

Ellen's total expenditure: 
- Leggings: $100
- Photo frame: $5
Total spent by Ellen: $100 + $5 = $105

Lani's total expenditure: 
- Sunglasses: $30
- Two bathrobes: $100 x 2 = $200
Total spent by Lani: $30 + $200 = $230

Total amount spent by both Ellen and Lani: $105 + $230 = $335

The final answer is: $335"
"To find the profit, we first need to calculate the cost of making one jar of the mixture and then multiply it by the number of jars sold.

The cost of making one jar of the mixture is:
- 2 pounds of passion fruit at $6 per pound: 2 * $6 = $12
- 1.5 pounds of jackfruit at $8 per pound: 1.5 * $8 = $12
- 2 pounds of honey at $10 per pound: 2 * $10 = $20
Total cost for one jar: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Now, let's calculate the profit for one jar:
Profit per jar = Selling price - Cost per jar
Profit per jar = $50 - $44 = $6

To find the total profit for 10 jars:
Total profit = Profit per jar * Number of jars
Total profit = $6 * 10
Total profit = $60

The final answer is: $60"
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add them together.

A quarter is worth $0.25, so 32 quarters are worth 32 x $0.25 = $8.

A dime is worth $0.10, so 95 dimes are worth 95 x $0.10 = $9.50.

A nickel is worth $0.05, so 120 nickels are worth 120 x $0.05 = $6.

A penny is worth $0.01, so 750 pennies are worth 750 x $0.01 = $7.50.

Now, let's add the values together: $8 + $9.50 + $6 + $7.50 = $30.50.

The total dollar amount in the jar is $30.50.

The final answer is: $30.50"
"To find out how much money Janet has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract that from the amount her parents gave her.

First, let's calculate the total amount she spent:

- Ice cream: $3.50
- Movie tickets (2 tickets): 2 x $7.50 = $15
- Bracelet: $8.50
Total spent: $3.50 + $15 + $8.50 = $27

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the amount her parents gave her:

$40 (given by parents) - $27 (total spent) = $13

Janet has $13 left."
"To find out how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days he works and then multiply it by the number of cars he services per day and his hourly wage.

Josh is open every day except Sunday and Wednesday, so he works 5 days a week. In 2 weeks, he works 5 days/week * 2 weeks = 10 days.

Since Josh services 3 cars a day, in 10 days, he services 3 cars/day * 10 days = 30 cars.

Josh gets paid $4 per car, so in 10 days, he makes 30 cars * $4/car = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Randy has 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. 

He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. So, he ate 1 oatmeal cookie, 1 chocolate chip cookie, and 1 sugar cookie. Now, he has:
- 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies
- 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies

He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. Now, he has:
- 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies (unchanged)
- 4 sugar cookies (unchanged)

He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. Now, he has:
- 6 oatmeal cookies (unchanged)
- 3 chocolate chip cookies (unchanged)
- 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies

Then, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. Now, he has:
- 6 + 4 = 10 oatmeal cookies
- 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies
- 2 + 4 = 6 sugar cookies

Now, Randy has 10 oatmeal cookies, 7 chocolate chip cookies, and 6 sugar cookies. 

The total number of cookies he has now is: 10 + 7 + 6 = 23"
"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the amount he would get for the first half of the collection and the second half separately, and then add them together.

Since Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, we can divide them into two equal halves: 6 toy soldiers for the first half and 6 toy soldiers for the second half.

For the first half, Matthew would get $5 per toy, so the total amount for the first half would be 6 * $5 = $30.

For the second half, Matthew would get $7 per toy, so the total amount for the second half would be 6 * $7 = $42.

Now, we add the amounts for both halves together: $30 + $42 = $72.

Therefore, Matthew would earn $72 if he agreed to the offer.

The final answer is: $72"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then find out how many holes Nate fills in per day. 

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled in per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes.

To find out how many days it takes to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled in per day: 84 / 3 = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the number of weeks by dividing the total number of days by 7: 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the average enrollment at Butler High School, we need to calculate 3/4 of the average enrollment at Norman High School. 

3/4 of 4000 is (3/4) * 4000 = 3000.

Now, we need to find the difference between the average enrollment at Norman High School and Butler High School. 

The difference is 4000 - 3000 = 1000.

"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the total number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Total rainbow and oatmeal cookies = 2595 + 3075 = 5670

Now, subtract the total number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made to find the number of chocolate chip cookies:
7995 - 5670 = 2325

The number of chocolate chip cookies made is 2325."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested (16), so he gathered 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
- He gathered two more Petri dishes than requested (14), so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.
- He gathered the correct number of beakers (7).
- The total number of items on the lab bench is 29.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

8 (test tubes) + 7 (beakers) + 16 (Petri dishes) + x (beakers lost) = 29

Combine the known quantities:
8 + 7 + 16 = 31

Now, subtract 31 from both sides of the equation to isolate x:
31 + x = 29
x = 29 - 31
x = -2

However, since we can't have a negative number of beakers lost, this means that Igor actually had more beakers than he lost. Let's re-examine the equation:
8 (test tubes) + 7 (beakers) + 16 (Petri dishes) = 31

Since the total number of items on the lab bench is 29, and we know that Igor had 31 items, this means that he actually had 31 - 29 = 2 fewer items than he should have. This 2 fewer items must be the beakers he lost.

So, the number of beakers Igor lost is 7 - 2 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we first need to calculate the total number of screws needed for the tables. 

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws, so each table needs 4 * 2 = 8 screws. 

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is 8 * 4 = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws initially. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the initial number of screws: 40 - 32 = 8.

So, James will have 8 screws left over.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we first need to determine the number of eggs in the second basket. Since there are twice as many eggs in the second basket as in the first, we can calculate it by multiplying the number of eggs in the first basket by 2.

Number of eggs in the first basket: 10
Number of eggs in the second basket: 10 * 2 = 20

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets to find the total.

Total number of eggs: 10 + 20 = 30

"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the individual amounts raised by each girl and then add them together.

Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, who raises $430. So, Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.

Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300. So, Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we add up the amounts raised by each girl: $750 (Kim) + $430 (Alexandra) + $700 (Maryam) + $300 (Sarah) = $2180.

The final answer is: $2180"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, but Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron. This means that if Aaron runs a certain distance in a certain time, Vanessa will run twice that distance in the same time.

Let's denote the time it takes Aaron to run 1 mile as 't'. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, the time it takes Vanessa to run 1 mile is 2t.

We are given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, and since he runs twice as fast as Vanessa, the distance he covered is half of the distance Vanessa covered. Vanessa ran 4 miles, so Aaron ran 4/2 = 2 miles.

Since Aaron runs 2 miles in 16 minutes, the time it takes him to run 1 mile is 16/2 = 8 minutes. This is the value of 't'.

Now, we know that Vanessa runs 1 mile in 2t, and we found that t = 8 minutes. So, the time it takes Vanessa to run 1 mile is 2t = 2 * 8 = 16 minutes.

Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, the total time it took her to complete her part of the race is 4 * 16 = 64 minutes.

The final answer is: 64"
"To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of line required for the existing dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, we multiply 200 by 3.

200 * 3 = 600 feet of line required for the existing dock.

Since he already has 6 feet of new line, we need to subtract that from the total amount of line required.

600 - 6 = 594 feet of line needed to buy.

The caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line."

First, let's calculate the daily revenue:

- Number of reservations per night: 6
- Meals per reservation: 2
- Cost of each meal: $5
- Total cost of meals per reservation: 2 * $5 = $10
- Cost of wine per reservation: $5
- Total cost per reservation: $10 + $5 = $15
- Daily revenue: 6 reservations * $15 = $90

Now, let's calculate the weekly revenue:

- Number of days open per week: 2
- Weekly revenue: $90 * 2 = $180

"To find the cost price of each watermelon, we first need to find the total cost of the watermelons. The total cost is $80. 

Since the vendor bought 50 watermelons, we can find the cost price of each watermelon by dividing the total cost by the number of watermelons.

Cost price of each watermelon = Total cost / Number of watermelons
Cost price of each watermelon = $80 / 50
Cost price of each watermelon = $1.60

Now, we need to find the selling price of each watermelon. The vendor sold the watermelons at a profit of 25%. 

Selling price of each watermelon = Cost price of each watermelon + (25% of Cost price of each watermelon)
Selling price of each watermelon = $1.60 + (0.25 * $1.60)
Selling price of each watermelon = $1.60 + $0.40
Selling price of each watermelon = $2

The selling price of each watermelon is $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then determine the age of John's youngest son.

First, let's find James' current age. We know that James is twice as old as Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. This means Dora's current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years. Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

Now, we know that James is 18 years old and John had James when he was 19. This means John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son's current age is 37 - 32 = 5 years.

In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many oranges each person can peel in an hour. 

Ana peels 1 orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels 1 orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane in an hour is 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original price of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it for 80% off. 

80% off means he pays 20% of the original price. To find 20% of $400, we multiply $400 by 0.20. 

$400 * 0.20 = $80

So, Mark pays $80 for the radiator. 

Next, we need to calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic works for 3 hours at $50 an hour. 

Cost of hiring the mechanic = 3 hours * $50/hour = $150

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of hiring the mechanic to find the total cost.

Total cost = $80 (radiator) + $150 (mechanic) = $230

The final answer is: $230"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation:

C + W = 20

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, so we can write the equation:

2C + 4W = 70

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by 2 to get:

2C + 2W = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate C:

(2C + 4W) - (2C + 2W) = 70 - 40
2W = 30

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

W = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of chickens:

C + 15 = 20
C = 5

So, there are 5 chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, let's find the total number of slices. There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. 

Total slices = 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

Now, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. There are 4 people in total, including Henry and his 3 friends.

Slices per person = Total slices / Number of people = 56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices/person

So, each person can have 14 slices. 

The final answer is: 14"
