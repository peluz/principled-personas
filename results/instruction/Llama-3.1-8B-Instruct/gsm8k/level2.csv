"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first determine how many eggs she has left after eating and baking. 

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and bakes 4 for muffins, so she uses a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. 

To find the number of eggs left, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

Janet sells these 9 eggs at $2 each, so she makes 9 * 2 = $18 per day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts needed, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, we can calculate the white fiber as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we add the blue fiber and white fiber to get the total:

Total bolts = 2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit Josh made, we first need to find the total value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

Let's denote the total value of the house after repairs as x. We can set up the equation:

x = 80,000 + 50,000
x = 130,000

However, the value of the house increased by 150%, so we need to find 150% of the original value and add it to the original value.

150% of 80,000 is 1.5 * 80,000 = 120,000

Now, we add this to the original value:

x = 80,000 + 120,000
x = 200,000

So, the total value of the house after repairs is $200,000.

To find the profit, we subtract the original cost of the house and the repairs from the total value:

Profit = Total value - (Original cost + Repairs)
Profit = 200,000 - (80,000 + 50,000)
Profit = 200,000 - 130,000
Profit = 70,000

The final answer is: $70,000"
"To find the total number of meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total number of meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sprint sessions he does in a week.

Since James runs 3 sprints in one session, and each sprint is 60 meters, the total meters he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James does this 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to determine the total number of cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals. 

In the morning, Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives her chickens 25 cups of feed. 

Total feed given in the morning and afternoon = 15 + 25 = 40 cups

Since Wendi feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per meal, and she has 20 chickens, the total number of cups of feed needed per meal is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

However, since the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is 40 cups, we need to subtract this from the total number of cups of feed needed per meal to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day.

Total feed needed per meal - Total feed given in the morning and afternoon = 60 - 40 = 20 cups

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 
The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * $3 = $1.8. 
We can see that the cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of the previous glass. 

The sequence of the cost of the glasses is: $5, $3, $1.8, $1.08, $0.64, $0.384, $0.2304, $0.13824, $0.082944, $0.0497664, $0.02986584, $0.017949504, $0.010794903, $0.00646784128, $0.003863960576, $0.0023281813456.

To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of all the glasses. 
Total cost = $5 + $3 + $1.8 + $1.08 + $0.64 + $0.384 + $0.2304 + $0.13824 + $0.082944 + $0.0497664 + $0.02986584 + $0.017949504 + $0.010794903 + $0.00646784128 + $0.003863960576 + $0.0023281813456
Total cost ≈ $23.999999999999996

However, we can simplify this process by using a formula. The cost of the first glass is $5, and the cost of the second glass is 60% of $5. The cost of the third glass is 60% of the second glass, which is (0.6)^2 * $5. The cost of the fourth glass is (0.6)^3 * $5, and so on. 

The total cost can be calculated as:
Total cost = $5 + 2 * (0.6 * $5) + 3 * (0.6^2 * $5) + 4 * (0.6^3 * $5) + ... + 16 * (0.6^15 * $5)

This is a geometric series with the first term a = $5, the common ratio r = 0.6, and the number of terms n = 16. The sum of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula:
S_n = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

However, since we are multiplying each term by the term number, we need to use the formula for the sum of a geometric series with the first term multiplied by the term number:
S_n = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)^2

Plugging in the values, we get:
S_n = $5 * (1 - 0.6^16) / (1 - 0.6)^2
S_n ≈ $23.999999999999996

"To find the number of sheep in Toulouse, we first need to find the number of sheep in Charleston. Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, we can multiply 20 by 4 to find the number of sheep in Charleston.

Charleston sheep = 20 * 4 = 80

Since Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, we can multiply the number of sheep in Charleston by 2 to find the number of sheep in Toulouse.

Toulouse sheep = 80 * 2 = 160

Now, we can add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle to find the total number of sheep.

Total sheep = Toulouse sheep + Charleston sheep + Seattle sheep
Total sheep = 160 + 80 + 20
Total sheep = 260

The final answer is: 260"
"To find the total time it takes Carla to download the file, we need to calculate the time it takes to download the first 80% of the file, add the time it takes to install the updates, and then add the time it takes to download the remaining 20% of the file.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download the first 80% of the file:
80% of 200 GB is 0.8 x 200 = 160 GB
Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, the time it takes to download 160 GB is 160 / 2 = 80 minutes

Next, we add the time it takes to install the updates, which is 20 minutes.

Now, we need to calculate the time it takes to download the remaining 20% of the file:
20% of 200 GB is 0.2 x 200 = 40 GB
The time it takes to download 40 GB is 40 / 2 = 20 minutes

Finally, we add the time it takes to download the first 80% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the remaining 20% of the file:
80 minutes + 20 minutes + 20 minutes = 120 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the distance covered in each segment.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. The distance covered in this segment is:

Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

Now, John turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours. However, he spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance in this segment.

Next, he drives for half an hour (0.5 hours) at 30 mph. The distance covered in this segment is:

Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

After that, he drives the remaining time (4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours) at 80 mph. The distance covered in this segment is:

Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles

Now, we need to find the total distance from home. Since John drove 180 miles away and then covered a total of 135 miles (15 + 120) towards home, we subtract the distance covered towards home from the distance driven away:

Total distance from home = 180 - 135 = 45 miles

The final answer is: 45"
"To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately, then add them together.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so her overtime rate is:
$10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour

Her overtime earnings are:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Now, we add her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours:
$400 + $60 = $460

Her total earnings for the week are $460.

"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. Then, we subtract 54 from 180 to get 126 downloads in the third month.

Now, we add the downloads from each month together: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"

"To solve this problem, we need to find the break-even point, which is the point at which the total cost of planting and maintaining the tree equals the total revenue from selling the lemons.

Let's denote the number of years as 'n'. The total cost of planting the tree is $90. The annual cost of watering and feeding the tree is $3. The total revenue from selling the lemons is 7n * $1.5.

The total cost is the sum of the initial cost and the annual costs, which is $90 + $3n. The total revenue is 7n * $1.5.

To find the break-even point, we set the total cost equal to the total revenue and solve for 'n':

$90 + $3n = 7n * $1.5

Subtract $3n from both sides:

$90 = 7n * $1.5 - $3n

Combine like terms:

$90 = 4.5n

Divide both sides by 4.5:

n = $90 / 4.5

n = 20

It will take 20 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

n = 20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

At the green house, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners, which is x/3.

At the red house, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners.

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which is (x - x/3 - 2)/2.

We know that after selling at all three houses, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the fractions:

6x - 2x - 12 - 3(x - x/3 - 2) = 30

Combine like terms:

4x - 12 - 3x + x + 6 = 30

Combine like terms:

2x - 6 = 30

Add 6 to both sides:

2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance and jazz dance.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20% of 20 = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

The number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is the remaining students after subtracting the students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance:
16 - 4 = 12 students

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To maximize profit, we need to consider the potential increase in value of both options. 

Let's calculate the potential increase in value for each option:

Jewelry: 2.5% of $5,000 = 0.025 * $5,000 = $125
Electronic gadgets: 1.2% of $8,000 = 0.012 * $8,000 = $96

Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, we should choose the option with the higher potential increase in value, which is the jewelry. 

However, to calculate the profit, we need to consider the initial cost of the jewelry, which is $5,000. 

Profit = Potential increase in value - Initial cost
Profit = $125 - $5,000 = -$4,875

The negative profit indicates that the merchant would actually incur a loss if they choose the jewelry option.

However, if we consider the electronic gadgets option, the profit would be:

Profit = Potential increase in value - Initial cost
Profit = $96 - $8,000 = -$7,904

Since both options result in a loss, we need to choose the option with the least loss to maximize profit.

The least loss is $4,875 for the jewelry option.

The final answer is: $-4875"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered on the first day and the distance covered on the second day.

On the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance. 

On the second day, they travel 150 miles northward. Again, since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance.

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is:

Day 1: 80 miles (westward)
Day 2: 150 miles (northward)

The total distance covered by each train in the two days is the sum of the distances covered on each day, which is 80 + 150 = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:

She works 35 hours a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total hours she works as a teacher in a year is:
35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year

Her hourly wage as a teacher is $20, so her annual earnings from teaching are:
1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:

She works 15 hours a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total hours she works as a coach in a year is:
15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year

Her hourly wage as a coach is $30, so her annual earnings from coaching are:
750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
$35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To find out how many eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week and then multiply it by 4.

Since Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. 

There are 7 days in a week, so she eats 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week.

In 4 weeks, she will eat 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she will eat in 4 weeks.

84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozen eggs.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total time Marissa has taken to walk the first 6 miles. She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles and another hour to walk the next 2 miles, so the total time taken is 1 + 1 = 2 hours.

The total distance she has covered is 6 miles, and she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail. Since average speed is calculated as total distance divided by total time, we can set up the equation:

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
4 = 12 / Total time

To find the total time, we can rearrange the equation:

Total time = 12 / 4
Total time = 3 hours

Since Marissa has already taken 2 hours to walk the first 6 miles, she has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left to walk the remaining 6 miles.

Now, we can find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance by dividing the remaining distance by the remaining time:

Speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 miles per hour

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To find the amount of water in the orange drink, we first need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. 

Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters.

Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in the orange drink is 6.67 liters.

Now, to find the amount of water in the pineapple drink, we need to calculate three-fifths of 15 liters.

Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is 9 liters.

Now, we have 6.67 liters of water from the orange drink and 9 liters of water from the pineapple drink. However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract 1/3 of the water from the orange drink.

1/3 of 6.67 liters is (1/3) * 6.67 = 2.22 liters.

So, the amount of water from the orange drink after spilling is 6.67 - 2.22 = 4.45 liters.

Now, we add the water from the orange drink and the pineapple drink: 4.45 + 9 = 13.45 liters.

However, we have a total of 24 liters after adding both drinks and spilling 1 liter of the orange drink. To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the 24 liters.

The total amount of water in the 24 liters is 13.45 + 10.8 (water in the remaining 10 liters of orange drink) = 24.25 liters.

However, we need to find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, not the total amount of water in the 24 liters. Since we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is the same as the total amount of water in the 24 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24.25}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how old Raymond was when his son was born. Since Raymond had a son at the age of 23, we can calculate his current age by adding the age of his son to his age at the time of his son's birth. 

Raymond's current age = 23 (age at son's birth) + son's current age. 

However, we don't know the son's current age. We can find it by calculating the difference between Samantha's current age and Raymond's current age. 

Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is 31 now, we can find Raymond's current age by subtracting 6 from Samantha's age.

Raymond's current age = 31 (Samantha's age) - 6 = 25

Now, we can find the son's current age by subtracting Raymond's age at the time of his son's birth from his current age.

Son's current age = 25 (Raymond's current age) - 23 (age at son's birth) = 2

Now that we know the son's current age, we can find out how many years ago he was born by subtracting his age from the current year. However, the current year is not provided in the question. We can assume it as 't'. 

Years ago son was born = t - 2

However, we can also find the difference in years between Samantha and Raymond's birth years. Since Samantha is 31 now and was born 6 years after Raymond, we can find the difference in years between their birth years.

Years between their birth years = 6

Now, we can find the difference in years between Samantha's birth year and the year Raymond's son was born. 

Years between Samantha's birth year and son's birth year = 31 (Samantha's age) - 2 (son's age) = 29

Since the difference in years between their birth years is 6, we can find the difference in years between Samantha's birth year and the year Raymond was born.

Years between Samantha's birth year and Raymond's birth year = 6

Now, we can find the difference in years between the year Raymond was born and the year his son was born.

Years between Raymond's birth year and son's birth year = 29 (years between Samantha's birth year and son's birth year) - 6 (years between Samantha's birth year and Raymond's birth year) = 23

However, this is the difference in years between the year Raymond was born and the year his son was born. Since we want to find the years ago son was born, we can simply use the difference in years between Raymond's birth year and son's birth year.

Years ago son was born = 23

"To find the total number of DVDs sold, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers.

The first 3 customers buy 1 DVD each, so they buy a total of 3 * 1 = 3 DVDs.
The next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each, so they buy a total of 2 * 2 = 4 DVDs.

Now, we add the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers: 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

The last 3 customers don't buy any DVDs, so we don't need to add anything to the total.

The total number of DVDs sold on Tuesday is 7."
"To find the total number of centimeters the candle will be shorter, we need to calculate the total time it burns and multiply it by the rate at which it melts.

The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is a total of 4 hours.

The rate at which the candle melts is 2 centimeters per hour.

So, the total number of centimeters the candle will be shorter is 4 hours * 2 centimeters/hour = 8 centimeters.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the original price of the book, we need to use the concept of percentage decrease. Since Kyle bought the book with a 25% discount, that means he paid 75% of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%).

Let's denote the original price as x. We know that 75% of x is equal to $19.50. We can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To solve for x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To find the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she ordered excluding the pizza. 

The cost of the chicken meal is $12. 
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15. 
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6. 

The total cost of the items excluding pizza is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33. 

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17. 

Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so the number of boxes of pizza is $17 / $8.50 = 2.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total amount Mishka spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

The cost of 3 pairs of shorts is 3 x $16.50 = $49.50.

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she buys and multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will go through 60 servings in 60 days. 

Each carton has 15 servings, so we need to divide 60 servings by 15 servings per carton to find out how many cartons she buys:

60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Now, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton:

4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

So, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find the distance traveled between Henry's first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip was 60 miles, we can find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip by subtracting 15 miles from 60 miles. 

60 - 15 = 45 miles

Now, we know that the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip. 

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip = 60 miles
Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip = 45 miles

Distance between the first and second stops = 60 - 45
Distance between the first and second stops = 15 miles

However, this is the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip minus the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip. To find the distance between the first and second stops, we need to subtract the distance from the first stop to the second stop, which is 15 miles.

Distance between the first and second stops = 20 - 15
Distance between the first and second stops = 5 miles

The distance between Henry's first and second stops is 5 miles.

"Let's denote the cost of the boots as B, the cost of the first pair of heels as H1, and the cost of the second pair of heels as H2. We are given that H1 = $33 and H2 = 2 * H1 = 2 * 33 = $66.

We are also given that the total cost of the two pairs of heels is $5 less than the cost of the boots. This can be expressed as:

H1 + H2 = B - 5

Substituting the values of H1 and H2, we get:

33 + 66 = B - 5

Combine like terms:

99 = B - 5

Add 5 to both sides:

104 = B

The cost of the boots is $104.

The final answer is: $104"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Darrell's age be 7x and Allen's age be 11x, where x is a constant.

Since their total age now is 162, we can set up the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms:

18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Darrell's and Allen's current ages:

Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

The third person guesses 25% more than the first one, which is 80 + (80 * 0.25) = 100.

Now, let's add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

There are 3 people, so we divide the total by 3 to find the average: 240 / 3 = 80.

"To find the total hours John spends taking care of dogs in a day, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time spent on each dog. 

Number of dogs: 10
Time spent on each dog: 0.5 hours

Total time spent in a day = Number of dogs * Time spent on each dog
Total time spent in a day = 10 * 0.5
Total time spent in a day = 5 hours

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to multiply the total time spent in a day by 7 to find the total time spent in a week.

Total time spent in a week = Total time spent in a day * 7
Total time spent in a week = 5 * 7
Total time spent in a week = 35 hours

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G.

We are given two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110: S + G = 110
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins: G = S + 30

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for S:

S + (S + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:

2S + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2S = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

S = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins by substituting S into the second equation:

G = S + 30
G = 40 + 30
G = 70

"To find the total points scored by Mike, we need to calculate the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes separately, and then add them together.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25 (since 25% = 25/100 = 0.25). 

4 * 0.25 = 1

So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in both periods: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The total points scored by Mike is 9."

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Since they are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry buys in 30 days. To do this, we divide the total number of yogurts he eats by 4: 60 / 4 = 15.

Now, we multiply the number of sets by the cost per set: 15 * $5.00 = $75.00.

"To find out how many Lego sets John still has, we first need to determine how much money he made from selling the Lego sets and how much he spent on video games.

John sells 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is:
13 * 15 = 195 dollars

He then buys 8 video games for $20 each, so the total amount of money he spent is:
8 * 20 = 160 dollars

Since he had $5 left after buying the video games, we can find out how much money he had before buying the video games by adding the $5 to the amount he spent:
195 - 160 = 35 dollars

However, this is the amount of money he had before buying the video games, not the amount he made from selling the Lego sets. Since he spent $160 on video games, we need to subtract this from the total amount he made to find out how much he had left:
195 - 160 = 35 dollars

Now, we know that John had $35 left after buying the video games, and he had $5 left after buying the video games. This means that the $35 is the amount he had before buying the video games, and the $5 is the remaining amount after buying the video games. To find out how much he spent on the video games, we subtract the remaining amount from the amount he had before buying the video games:
35 - 5 = 30 dollars

However, we already know that he spent $160 on video games, so we can ignore this calculation.

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his total running time in hours and then divide the total distance by that time.

First, let's find out how many hours John runs in a week. He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. Half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours. So, he runs 1.5 hours on each of the other two days.

Total hours run per week = 3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day) = 6 hours

Now, we know John runs 60 miles in 6 hours. To find out his speed, we need to divide the total distance by the total time.

Speed = Total distance / Total time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running and walking speeds. 

Given that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour and her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed, we can find her running speed by multiplying her skipping speed by 2. 

Running speed = 2 * Skipping speed
Running speed = 2 * 3
Running speed = 6 miles per hour

Since Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, we can find her walking speed by dividing her running speed by 4.

Walking speed = Running speed / 4
Walking speed = 6 / 4
Walking speed = 1.5 miles per hour

Now, we know that Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, in 6 hours, she will spend 2 hours running and 4 hours walking.

Distance traveled while running = Speed * Time
Distance traveled while running = 6 * 2
Distance traveled while running = 12 miles

Distance traveled while walking = Speed * Time
Distance traveled while walking = 1.5 * 4
Distance traveled while walking = 6 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance traveled while running + Distance traveled while walking
Total distance traveled = 12 + 6
Total distance traveled = 18 miles

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the age of Brandon's iPhone, we need to first find the age of Ben's iPhone. Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, and Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, we can calculate Ben's iPhone age as follows:

Ben's iPhone age = 2 * Suzy's iPhone age
Ben's iPhone age = 2 * 1
Ben's iPhone age = 2 years

Now, we know that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. So, we can calculate Brandon's iPhone age as follows:

Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * Ben's iPhone age
Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * 2
Brandon's iPhone age = 8 years

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone. Since she can throw it three times farther than without the gemstone, we multiply the original distance by 3.

Original distance = 400 feet
Distance with gemstone = 3 * 400 = 1200 feet

Now, we need to find the distance outside the dragon's reach where Polly can stand and still hit the dragon. The dragon's reach is 1000 feet, so we subtract this from the distance Polly can throw with the gemstone.

Distance outside reach = Distance with gemstone - Dragon's reach
= 1200 - 1000
= 200 feet

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces initially available.

First, let's calculate the total number of pieces initially available. Since Grandma Jones baked 5 pies and cut each pie into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is:

5 pies * 8 pieces/pie = 40 pieces

Now, let's subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces:

40 pieces - 14 pieces = 26 pieces

So, 26 pieces of pie were taken by the guests.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how many calories are left, we need to subtract the calories already consumed from the daily target. 

Daily target: 2000 calories
Calories already consumed: 1800 calories
Remaining calories: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, we need to find out how many servings can be eaten with the remaining calories.

Remaining calories: 200 calories
Calories per serving: 250 calories
Number of servings: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings

Since there are 5 servings in a 300g bag, we need to find out how many grams are in 0.8 servings.

Number of servings in a bag: 5 servings
Number of servings to be eaten: 0.8 servings
Fraction of the bag: 0.8 / 5 = 0.16

To find the grams that can be eaten, we multiply the fraction of the bag by the total weight of the bag.

Total weight of the bag: 300g
Fraction of the bag: 0.16
Grams that can be eaten: 300 * 0.16 = 48

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's find the total cost. Since one pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00, and Charlie makes 10 candles from one pound of beeswax, the cost per candle is $1.00 ($10.00 / 10 candles). 

The total cost for 20 candles is $20.00 ($1.00 per candle * 20 candles).

Now, let's find the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, so the total revenue for 20 candles is $40.00 ($2.00 per candle * 20 candles).

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $20.00.

Net profit: $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply it by the average time it takes to write an article (4 hours).

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. To find 2/5 of 5, we multiply 5 by 2/5:
5 * (2/5) = 2
So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days:
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many Post-it notes Candice had after placing one on each of the 220 cups of coffee. We know that she had 80 Post-it notes initially and 23 remaining after placing the notes on the cups. 

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as x. The total number of Post-it notes Candice had after purchasing the package is 80 + x. After placing one note on each of the 220 cups, she had 80 + x - 220 = 23 remaining. 

Now, let's solve for x:

80 + x - 220 = 23
x - 140 = 23
x = 23 + 140
x = 163

The final answer is: 163"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of blue ties John bought and the cost of the red ties.

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties by dividing the total amount spent by the cost per tie:

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

The cost of the red ties is 50% more than the cost of the blue ties. Since the blue ties cost $40 each, the cost of the red ties is:

Cost of red ties = Cost of blue ties + (50% of the cost of blue ties)
= $40 + (0.5 * $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can find the total amount spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost per red tie:

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

The total amount spent on ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches, since the pieces are 6 inches long. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so we multiply 4 feet by 12 inches/foot to get the total length of the wire in inches.

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we divide the total length of the wire in inches by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces Tracy obtained.

48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces

"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs produced per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs produced per week:
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since Lloyd sells eggs by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
1764 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's calculate the total amount Lloyd makes per week:
147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

"To find the total time Tom's ship takes to travel from 1 to 4 PM and back, we need to calculate the time taken for each leg of the journey separately.

First, let's find the time taken for the first leg of the journey (from 1 to 4 PM). Since the time is given in a 12-hour format, we can assume that the time from 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles

Now, let's find the time taken for the return journey. We know the distance is the same (30 miles) and the speed is 6 mph.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours

So, the time taken for the return journey is 5 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much weight the comic books weigh in total. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and Uriah removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * (1/4) = 7.5 pounds.

Since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, the remaining weight that needs to be removed from toys is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so to find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / (1/2) = 7.5 * 2 = 15.

"To find the revenue earned on Thursday, we need to calculate the total revenue from truck tires and car tires separately and then add them together. 

Revenue from truck tires on Thursday = 6 * $60 = $360
Revenue from car tires on Thursday = 4 * $40 = $160
Total revenue on Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520

Revenue from car tires on Friday = 12 * $40 = $480

Since the revenue from car tires on Friday ($480) is higher than the revenue from truck tires on Thursday ($360), we need to compare it with the total revenue on Thursday ($520) to find the day with higher revenue. 

The total revenue on Thursday ($520) is higher than the revenue from car tires on Friday ($480). 

Now, we need to find the difference in revenue between the day with higher revenue and the day with lower revenue. 

Difference in revenue = Total revenue on Thursday - Revenue from car tires on Friday
= $520 - $480
= $40

"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit, and then divide the result by the weight of each box.

First, let's calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge:

Bridge's weight limit: 5000 pounds
Combined weight of driver and empty truck: 3755 pounds
Remaining weight capacity: 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Next, let's divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of each box:

Weight of each box: 15 pounds
Maximum number of boxes: 1245 / 15 = 83

So, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83.

"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to follow the order of operations. 

First, let's find the total cost of the groceries before the delivery fee and tip. We know that the final bill was $40.00, but this includes the delivery fee and tip. To find the original cost of the groceries, we need to subtract the delivery fee and tip from the final bill.

Delivery fee and tip: $3.00 + $4.00 = $7.00
Final bill: $40.00
Original cost of groceries: $40.00 - $7.00 = $33.00

Now, we need to find the cost of the groceries before the 25% delivery fee was added. Let's call this x. The 25% delivery fee is 0.25x. We know that x + 0.25x = $33.00 (the original cost of the groceries).

Combine like terms: 1.25x = $33.00
Divide both sides by 1.25: x = $33.00 / 1.25
x = $26.40

So, the original cost of the groceries was $26.40. 

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $26.40."

"To find Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to calculate the value of the pension after 20 years and then add the additional 5% per year for the remaining 10 years.

The pension after 20 years is $50,000/year. 

For the next 10 years, she gets 5% of the value of the pension per year. This means her pension increases by 5% of $50,000 each year.

To find the increase in pension, we multiply $50,000 by 5% (or 0.05). 

$50,000 * 0.05 = $2,500

Since this is an annual increase, we multiply this by the number of years (10) to find the total increase in pension.

$2,500 * 10 = $25,000

Now, we add the total increase to the initial pension to find the final pension.

$50,000 + $25,000 = $75,000

"To find the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to calculate the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately and then add them together.

The first half of the year is 6 months, so the amount she paid for the first half is:
$140 * 6 = $840

For the second half of the year, she paid 10% less than the initial amount. To find 10% of $140, we multiply $140 by 0.1:
$140 * 0.1 = $14
Then, we subtract this amount from the initial amount to find the reduced amount:
$140 - $14 = $126
The amount she paid for the second half of the year is:
$126 * 6 = $756

Now, we add the amounts she paid for the first and second half of the year to find the total amount:

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to determine the car's mileage per gallon. We can do this by dividing the distance she traveled since the last fill-up (100 miles) by the amount of gas she used to fill up (4 gallons).

Mileage per gallon = Distance / Amount of gas used
Mileage per gallon = 100 miles / 4 gallons
Mileage per gallon = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know the car's mileage per gallon, we can find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a full tank by multiplying the mileage per gallon by the tank's capacity.

Total miles per tank = Mileage per gallon * Tank capacity
Total miles per tank = 25 miles/gallon * 12 gallons
Total miles per tank = 300 miles

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so the total amount she receives from her allowance is 5 * 8 = $40.

At the end of the 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100, which is the sum of her initial amount and the allowance she received. We can write this as an equation:

x + 40 = 100

To find the initial amount Bailey had, we need to isolate 'x' by subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation:

x = 100 - 40
x = 60

So, Bailey started with $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how much Judy makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week and then multiply it by the number of students per class and the charge per student.

Judy teaches 5 classes per day on weekdays, which is 5 classes/day * 5 days = 25 classes. 
On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes. 
So, the total number of classes in a week is 25 classes + 8 classes = 33 classes.

Each class has 15 students, so the total number of students per week is 33 classes * 15 students/class = 495 students.

Judy charges $15.00 per student, so the total amount she makes in a week is 495 students * $15/student = $7,425.

The final answer is: $7425"
"To find the total number of instructions, we need to add the number of instructions in the first recipe to the number of instructions in the second recipe.

The first recipe has 20 instructions. 
The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, so it has 2 * 20 = 40 instructions.

Now, we add the number of instructions in both recipes: 20 + 40 = 60.

"To find the total cost of the cell phones, we need to calculate the interest charged and add it to the original price. 

First, let's find the total cost of the cell phones: 
5 cell phones * $150 each = $750

Next, let's calculate the interest charged for 3 months at 2% per month:
Interest per month = 2% of $750 = 0.02 * $750 = $15
Since the interest is charged for 3 months, we multiply the interest per month by 3:
Total interest = $15 * 3 = $45

Now, let's add the total interest to the original price:
Total cost = $750 + $45 = $795

Since Shiela is paying in installments, we need to divide the total cost by 3 months:
Monthly payment = $795 / 3 = $265

The final answer is: $265"

"To find the average square footage of a level, we need to find the total square footage of all levels and then divide it by the number of levels.

The top level has a square footage of 16. Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can find the square footage of the other levels by dividing the previous level's square footage by 2.

Level 1 (top): 16
Level 2: 16 / 2 = 8
Level 3: 8 / 2 = 4
Level 4 (bottom): 4 / 2 = 2

Now, we add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30

There are 4 levels in total. To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels: 30 / 4 = 7.5

The final answer is: 7.5"
"To find the total number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total number of cups of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year.

The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days. So, the total number of cups of dog food eaten in the first 180 days is 1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups.

The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food per day for the rest of its life, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days. So, the total number of cups of dog food eaten in the rest of the year is 2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups.

The total number of cups of dog food eaten in the first year is 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year is 550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.
3. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.

From point 2, we can express the amount of laundry David does in terms of Sarah's laundry: 
David's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 4
David's laundry = 400 / 4
David's laundry = 100 pounds

From point 1, we can express the amount of laundry Raymond does in terms of Sarah's laundry: 
Raymond's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 2
Raymond's laundry = 400 / 2
Raymond's laundry = 200 pounds

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:
Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
Difference = 200 - 100
Difference = 100 pounds

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the better price, we need to calculate the cost per flower for each package option.

For the package of 3 flowers for $2.50, the cost per flower is:
$2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower

For the package of 2 flowers for $1, the cost per flower is:
$1 / 2 = $0.50 per flower

Since $0.50 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers for $1 is the better option.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price:
18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages
9 packages * $1 per package = $9

To find the cost of buying 18 flowers at the original price:
18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages
6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15

The amount of money saved by buying 18 flowers at the better price is:

"To find out how much water the girls got, we need to calculate 1/6 of 24 liters. 

1/6 of 24 liters = (1/6) * 24 = 4 liters

Since there are two girls, they each got 4 liters of water. So, the total amount of water the girls got is 4 * 2 = 8 liters.

Now, we subtract the total amount of water the girls got from the initial 24 liters to find out how much water is left. 

24 - 8 = 16 liters

Then, we subtract the 6 liters the boy got from the remaining 16 liters.

16 - 6 = 10 liters

"Let's denote the number of games the team lost as L and the number of games they won as W. We are given that W = L + 8. We also know that the total number of games played is 22, so W + L = 22.

We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation: (L + 8) + L = 22.

Combine like terms: 2L + 8 = 22.

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2L = 14.

Divide both sides by 2: L = 7.

Now that we know L, we can find W by substituting L into the first equation: W = L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15.

"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her salary after the 5th year and then increase it by 10% for each of the next three years.

Initial salary: $600
Increase after 5 years: 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 5 years: $600 + $60 = $660

Now, we need to increase her salary by 10% for each of the next three years:
- Year 6: 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
- Year 7: 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
- Year 8: 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86

"To find out how many gift bags Christina needs, we first need to calculate the number of guests who will actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, we can find the number of guests who will attend by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of invited guests.

16 (total invited guests) - (1/4) * 16 = 16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply the number of guests who will attend by 0.75 to find the total number of gift bags needed.

12 (guests attending) * 0.75 (gift bags per guest) = 9

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can set up an equation:

Lee's time = Gerald's time + 2 seconds
38 = Gerald's time + 2

Now, we need to isolate Gerald's time:
Gerald's time = 38 - 2
Gerald's time = 36 seconds

Gerald's speed improved by 10% after changing his diet. To find his new time, we need to calculate 10% of his original time and subtract it from his original time:
10% of 36 = 0.1 * 36 = 3.6 seconds

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.
2. There are two cats for every dog.
3. The number of dogs is 60.

Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, the number of cats can be calculated as follows:

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
= 2 * 60
= 120

Now, we know the number of dogs and cats. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. Let's calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 60 + 120
= 180

Now, we can find the number of rabbits:

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
= 180 - 12
= 168

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
= 60 + 120 + 168

Number of boys = (2/5) * 200 = (2 * 200) / 5 = 400 / 5 = 80

Since there are 200 students in total, the number of girls is:
Number of girls = Total students - Number of boys = 200 - 80 = 120

Now, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = (2/3) * Number of girls = (2 * 120) / 3 = 240 / 3 = 80

Now, to find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we need to first calculate the total number of potted plants she has initially. 

She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so the total number of potted plants she has is 2 * 40 = 80.

Yesterday, she received 18 new potted plants, so the total number of potted plants she has now is 80 + 18 = 98.

Tomorrow, she will give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to her friends and family, so she will give away 40 potted plants.

To find out how many potted plants she will have left, we subtract the number of potted plants she gives away from the total number of potted plants she has now: 98 - 40 = 58.

The final answer is: 58"
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and add them up.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. 
1/4 of 20 is 5, so the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
Since the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, we add up the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell: 
20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 70 (third friend) + 60 (fourth friend) = 175

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."
"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read in total, we need to add up the pages from all his textbooks. 

4 pages (Science) + 20 pages (Social Studies) + 7 pages (History) + 8 pages (Geography) = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, we need to subtract those from the total to find out how many pages are left to read.

39 pages - 15 pages = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average per day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days.

24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately, and then add them together.

On weekdays, John drinks 4 glasses of water (one with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and one before bed). Since there are 5 weekdays, he drinks 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 3 glasses of water (one with breakfast, lunch, and one before bed, but not with dinner since he has a soda). Since there are 2 weekend days, he drinks 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water on weekends.

To find the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we add the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends: 20 + 6 = 26.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find the time it takes for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to determine how many 3-mile sections the city is divided into and then multiply that by the time it takes to cover each section.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

To find the number of 3-mile sections, we divide the total distance by the length of each section: 
42 miles / 3 miles per section = 14 sections

Now, we multiply the number of sections by the time it takes to cover each section:
14 sections * 10 minutes per section = 140 minutes

"To find out how many pieces Poppy placed, we need to calculate a quarter of 1000. 

A quarter of 1000 is 1000 / 4 = 250 pieces.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left after Poppy placed 250 pieces. 

1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left.

Then, her mom places a third of the remaining pieces. 

A third of 750 is 750 / 3 = 250 pieces.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left after her mom placed 250 pieces. 

750 - 250 = 500 pieces left.

"To find the total number of cookies both Cody and Amir eat, we need to first determine how many cookies Cody eats. Since Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, and Amir eats 5 cookies, we can multiply the number of cookies Amir eats by 3 to find the number of cookies Cody eats.

Cody eats 3 * 5 = 15 cookies.

Now, to find the total number of cookies both of them eat, we add the number of cookies Amir eats to the number of cookies Cody eats.

Total cookies = 5 (Amir's cookies) + 15 (Cody's cookies) = 20

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to find the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The dimensions of the box are given as 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick. This means that the inner dimensions of the box are (5-2) inches by (6-2) inches by (4-2) inches, which is 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches.

The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is length * width * height. 

So, the inner volume of one box is 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 3 * 24 = 72 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 2 episodes of a 1-hour show, which is 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's call the number of episodes x. Since each episode is 30 minutes, the total time he watched on Wednesday is 30x minutes.

On Thursday, he watched 1 hour (60 minutes) and 1 30-minute episode, for a total of 90 minutes.

On Friday, he watched 2 episodes of a 1-hour show, which is 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

The total time Frankie watched TV is 7 hours, which is 7 * 60 = 420 minutes.

We can set up an equation to represent the total time Frankie watched TV:

2 + 30x + 90 + 2 * 60 = 420

Combine like terms:

2 + 30x + 90 + 120 = 420

Combine the constants:

212 + 30x = 420

Subtract 212 from both sides:

30x = 208

Divide both sides by 30:

x = 208 / 30

x = 6.93 (round down to 6.93, but since you can't watch a fraction of an episode, we'll round down to 6)

However, we need to check if this solution is correct. Let's calculate the total time Frankie watched TV using x = 6:

2 + 30 * 6 + 90 + 2 * 60 = 2 + 180 + 90 + 120 = 392

This is less than 420, so we need to try x = 7:

2 + 30 * 7 + 90 + 2 * 60 = 2 + 210 + 90 + 120 = 422

This is more than 420, so x must be between 6 and 7. Let's try x = 6.5:

2 + 30 * 6.5 + 90 + 2 * 60 = 2 + 195 + 90 + 120 = 407

This is still less than 420, so we need to try x = 6.67 (the average of 6 and 7):

2 + 30 * 6.67 + 90 + 2 * 60 = 2 + 200.1 + 90 + 120 = 412.1

This is still less than 420, so we need to try x = 7.33 (the average of 6.67 and 7):

2 + 30 * 7.33 + 90 + 2 * 60 = 2 + 219.9 + 90 + 120 = 431.9

This is more than 420, so x must be between 6.67 and 7.33. Let's try x = 7. 

2 + 30 * 7 + 90 + 2 * 60 = 2 + 210 + 90 + 120 = 422

This is still more than 420, so we need to try x = 6.67 again.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let x be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.

Since Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, he plans to bake 2x cookies this year.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has a total of 110 cookies. This can be represented by the equation:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x = 100

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total cost of gas before the cashback, we multiply the price per gallon by the number of gallons purchased: 

$3.00 per gallon * 10 gallons = $30.00

Next, we calculate the total cashback reward by multiplying the cashback per gallon by the number of gallons purchased:

$.20 per gallon * 10 gallons = $2.00

Now, we subtract the cashback reward from the total cost of gas to find the final cost:

$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The final answer is: $28.00"
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by each, we need to multiply the width by the length of each roll-up. 

Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 roll-ups wide * 24 roll-ups long = 48 roll-ups
Marcell's roll-ups: 3 roll-ups wide * 14 roll-ups long = 42 roll-ups

Next, we need to find the total number of roll-ups eaten by both of them. 
Total roll-ups = Beatrice's roll-ups + Marcell's roll-ups = 48 + 42 = 90

To find the average number of roll-ups eaten, we need to divide the total number of roll-ups by 2 (since there are two people).
Average roll-ups = Total roll-ups / 2 = 90 / 2 = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to calculate the total amount of water taken on per second and then multiply it by the total time it took to reach the shore.

First, let's find the rate at which the boat takes on water per second. Since it takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet, the boat takes on 2 liters for every 10 feet. 

To find the rate per second, we need to find out how much water is taken on per foot. Since 2 liters are taken on for every 10 feet, the rate per foot is 2/10 = 0.2 liters per foot.

Now, we need to find the rate per second. Since it takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet, the rate per second is (0.2 liters/foot) / (20 feet / 16 seconds) = 0.2 / (20/16) = 0.2 * (16/20) = 0.16 liters per second.

Now, we need to find the total time it took to reach the shore, which is 64 seconds.

The total amount of water taken on is the rate per second multiplied by the total time: 0.16 liters/second * 64 seconds = 10.24 liters.

The final answer is: 10.24"
"To find the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to calculate the total number of lessons and then multiply it by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

Each teacher has 2 lessons per day, and there are 4 teachers. So, the total number of lessons per day is 2 * 4 = 8.

The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson. Therefore, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is 8 * 3 = 24.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
2. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.
3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

From point 1, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. Let's denote the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as B. Then, Jamal's phone can hold 6B photographs.

We are given that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. So, we can set up the equation:

6B = 1800

To find the value of B, we divide both sides by 6:

B = 1800 / 6
B = 300

Now, we know that Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs. From point 2, we are told that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of birds in Jamal's photograph as D. Then, we can set up the equation:

300 = 50D

To find the value of D, we divide both sides by 50:

D = 300 / 50
D = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the profit, we first need to calculate the total cost of the lumber and the total selling price. 

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 = $100. 
The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80. 
The total cost is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each. 
The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

The total selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $15 = $150. 
The total selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $24 = $120. 
The total selling price is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total selling price minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we need to first find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 7 + 13 = 20. 

Since the total amount of sugar and water used is 120, we can set up a proportion to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used. Let's say the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used is 7x. 

The proportion can be set up as follows: 7x / 20 = 120 / 20. 

Solving for x, we get x = 120 / 7 = 17.14 (round to 2 decimal places). 

Since we are dealing with teaspoons, we can round down to the nearest whole number as you can't have a fraction of a teaspoon. 

However, in this case, we can use the exact value of x to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used. 

The number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used is 7x = 7 * 17.14 = 120. 

However, this is not the answer we are looking for. We need to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used, which is 7x. 

The number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used is 7 * 17.14 = 120.98."
"To find the total amount John paid, we need to calculate the cost of the shoes for each child and then multiply it by the number of children.

Since John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each child and each pair costs $60, the cost for each child is 2 * $60 = $120.

Now, we multiply the cost for each child by the number of children: $120 * 3 = $360.

Therefore, John paid $360.

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we first need to find the total number of vehicles that were already at the port. We know that there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles initially is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30. To find the number of vehicles brought in on the second day, we subtract the initial number of vehicles from the total number of vehicles: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers brought in on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles brought in by the number of vehicles per container: 20 / 5 = 4.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Lylah's original salary, then find Adrien's salary four years later, and finally find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later.

Let's start by finding Lylah's original salary. We know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. If Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, then Lylah's salary four years ago can be found by dividing Adrien's salary by 1.3 (since 100% + 30% = 130%, or 1.3).

Lylah's original salary = $40000 / 1.3
Lylah's original salary = $30769.23

Now, let's find Adrien's salary four years later. We know that his salary increased by 40% from four years ago. To find his new salary, we multiply his original salary by 1.4 (since 100% + 40% = 140%, or 1.4).

Adrien's salary four years later = $40000 * 1.4
Adrien's salary four years later = $56000

Now, let's find Lylah's salary four years later. We know that her salary also increased by 40% from four years ago. To find her new salary, we multiply her original salary by 1.4.

Lylah's salary four years later = $30769.23 * 1.4
Lylah's salary four years later = $43055.522

Now, we can find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later by adding their salaries.

Total salary four years later = Adrien's salary four years later + Lylah's salary four years later
Total salary four years later = $56000 + $43055.522
Total salary four years later = $99055.522

"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he uses in a week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a month.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So, the total number of sheets he uses in a week is:
2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the number of sheets used in a week by 4 to get the total number of sheets used in a month:
60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, so Kael brought 2 * 5 = 10 apples. 
Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, so Kael brought 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits each person brought:
Morisette: 5 apples + 8 oranges = 13 fruits
Kael: 10 apples + 4 oranges = 14 fruits

The total number of fruits they have is 13 + 14 = 27.

"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate the hours she slept on each day and add them up.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

The rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday) she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours she slept for each period:

- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday and Wednesday: 2 days * 6 hours = 12 hours
- Thursday to Sunday: 5 days * 7 hours = 35 hours

"To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour.

First, let's calculate the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's calculate the remaining time after 3 hours:
Total time = 7 hours
Time already run = 3 hours
Remaining time = Total time - Time already run
Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours
Remaining time = 4 hours

Next, let's calculate the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distances together to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours:
Total distance = Distance at 10 miles/hour + Distance at 5 miles/hour
Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total distance = 50 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many letters Jennie stamped and then subtract that from the total number of letters that were already stamped when she began.

We know that Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. Since there are 60 letters needing stamps, one-third of that is 60 / 3 = 20 letters.

We also know that after Jennie stamped the letters, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This means that the 20 letters Jennie stamped were added to the pile of already-stamped letters.

So, to find out how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began, we need to subtract the 20 letters Jennie stamped from the current total of 30 letters.

30 - 20 = 10

Therefore, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to determine the cost of each item and then multiply it by the quantity.

Let's start by finding the cost of a watermelon. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs $15, the cost of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45.

Next, we find the cost of an orange. An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so the cost of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each item:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is the sum of the costs of all items: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

"To find the profit, we first need to calculate the total time spent by doctors and the total amount charged to patients.

The hospital sees 500 people a day, and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. 

First, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

24 minutes / 60 = 0.4 hours

Now, we can calculate the total time spent by doctors:

500 patients * 0.4 hours/patient = 200 hours

The doctors charge $150 an hour, so the total amount charged by doctors is:

200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

The hospital charges the patients $200 an hour, so the total amount charged to patients is:

500 patients * 0.4 hours/patient * $200/hour = $80,000

We are given that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B.

We are also given that there are twice as many babies as queens, so B = 2Q.

We know that the total number of bees in the hive is 700, so W + B + Q = 700.

Substituting W = 2B and B = 2Q into the equation W + B + Q = 700, we get:

2B + B + Q = 700
3B + Q = 700

Since B = 2Q, we can substitute this into the equation 3B + Q = 700 to get:

3(2Q) + Q = 700
6Q + Q = 700
7Q = 700

Dividing both sides by 7, we get:

Q = 100

Now that we know Q = 100, we can find B by substituting Q into the equation B = 2Q:

B = 2(100)
B = 200

Now that we know B = 200, we can find W by substituting B into the equation W = 2B:

W = 2(200)
W = 400

The number of worker bees is 400."
"To find out how much money Jordan would earn in one week, we need to calculate the total hours he would work in a week and then multiply it by his hourly wage.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day, if he spent that time working instead, he would work 2 hours a day. 

There are 7 days in a week, so the total hours he would work in a week is 2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week.

His hourly wage is $10, so the total amount he would earn in a week is 14 hours/week * $10/hour = $140/week.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of food items and non-food items separately and then add them together.

Food items: milk and eggs
Cost of milk = 2 dollars
Cost of eggs = 3 dollars
Total cost of food items = 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Non-food items: light bulbs, cups, and roach traps
Cost of light bulbs = 3 dollars
Cost of cups = 3 dollars
Cost of roach traps = 4 dollars
Total cost of non-food items = 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount:
Tax amount = 10% of 10 dollars = 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar

Now, we add the tax amount to the total cost of non-food items:
Total cost of non-food items with tax = 10 + 1 = 11 dollars

Now, we add the total cost of food items and the total cost of non-food items with tax:
Total cost = 5 + 11 = 16 dollars

The final answer is: $16"
"To find the total profit, we first need to calculate the total income and total expenses. 

Kim has 3 current clients and 5 potential clients, making a total of 8 clients. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. 

Total bottles of bleach needed per week = 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed per week = 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

The cost of bleach per week = 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
The cost of cloths per week = 8 packs * $5/pack = $40

Total expenses per week = $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72

Since Kim's total income per week is $92, we can find the profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total income.

Profit per week = Total income - Total expenses
Profit per week = $92 - $72
Profit per week = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To find the total number of pineapples John has, we multiply the number of hectares by the number of pineapples per hectare. 

10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we need to find out how many 3-month periods are in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so we divide 12 by 3 to get the number of harvests per year.

12 months/year / 3 months/harvest = 4 harvests/year

Now, we multiply the total number of pineapples by the number of harvests per year to find the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year.

1000 pineapples * 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples/year

The final answer is: 4000"
"To find the total number of blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each set and add them together.

The first set has 500 pieces.
The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.
The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set, so it has 500 / 4 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the number of pieces in each set together:
500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125

The final answer is: 2125"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return. So, 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees return.
3. The number of bees that have left but not returned so far is 30 - 15 = 15 bees.
4. In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the ones that left in the first 6 hours fly from the hive and leave. So, 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave.
5. The total number of bees that have left but not returned so far is 15 (from step 3) + 60 (from step 4) = 75 bees.
6. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. So, 75 bees return.

"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then add the change she received.

The cost of 1 adult ticket is $12 and the cost of 1 child ticket is $10. 

Total cost = cost of adult ticket + cost of child ticket
Total cost = $12 + $10
Total cost = $22

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, we need to add this to the total cost to find out how much she gave the cashier.

Total given = Total cost + Change
Total given = $22 + $8
Total given = $30

The final answer is: $30"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many friends Dorothy has. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up the equation:

Charlie's friends = 3 * Dorothy's friends
12 = 3 * Dorothy's friends

To find Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

Dorothy's friends = 12 / 3
Dorothy's friends = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find out how many friends James has. Since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, we can set up the equation:

James' friends = 4 * Dorothy's friends
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

"To find out who will win the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distance from miles to feet for both Steve and Tim. Since 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet, we can convert their distances as follows:

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school:

Steve's time: distance / speed = 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: distance / speed = 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes to get home and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will win the race. To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to subtract the winner's time from the loser's time:

Waiting time = Tim's time - Steve's time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find the total amount of money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating all the tires.

First, let's calculate the cost of inflating the bicycle tires. Each bicycle has 2 tires, and there were 5 bicycles. So, the total number of bicycle tires is 5 * 2 = 10. 

The cost of inflating each tire is 25 cents, so the total cost of inflating the bicycle tires is 10 * 25 cents = 250 cents.

Next, let's calculate the cost of inflating the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and there were 3 tricycles. So, the total number of tricycle tires is 3 * 3 = 9. 

The cost of inflating each tire is 25 cents, so the total cost of inflating the tricycle tires is 9 * 25 cents = 225 cents.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of inflating the unicycle tire. A unicycle has 1 tire, and there was 1 unicycle. So, the total number of unicycle tires is 1 * 1 = 1.

The cost of inflating each tire is 25 cents, so the total cost of inflating the unicycle tire is 1 * 25 cents = 25 cents.

Now, let's add up the total cost of inflating all the tires: 250 cents + 225 cents + 25 cents = 500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 500 cents / 100 = 5 dollars.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Dave ate 14 french fries initially.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   Now, the total number of fries eaten by Dave and the seagull is 14 + 7 = 21.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
   Now, the total number of fries eaten by Dave, the seagull, and the pigeons is 21 + 9 = 30.
4. A raccoon ate two-thirds of the remaining fries. Let's denote the total number of fries initially as 'x'. 
   After the pigeons ate, the remaining fries are x - 30. The raccoon ate 2/3 of this, which is (2/3)(x - 30).
   The remaining fries after the raccoon ate are (1/3)(x - 30).
5. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 behind. This means that (1/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5.
6. To solve for x, we need to isolate it. First, add 1 to both sides of the equation: (1/3)(x - 30) = 6.
7. Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction: x - 30 = 18.
8. Add 30 to both sides to solve for x: x = 48.

"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in a week, we need to calculate the total hours he spends on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and the total hours he spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes each day, and each class is 1 hour long. So, the total hours he spends on these days is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes each day, and each class is 2 hours long. So, the total hours he spends on these days is 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 hours.

The total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a week is 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester is 17 * 16 = 272 hours.

"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to convert the length of each item to the same unit. Since the baguettes are given in feet, we'll convert the rolls and croissants to feet.

There are 12 inches in a foot, so we'll convert the rolls and croissants to feet:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Convert inches to feet: 1200 inches / 12 inches/foot = 100 feet
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Convert inches to feet: 720 inches / 12 inches/foot = 60 feet
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet

Now, we add up the lengths of all the baked goods in feet:
100 feet (rolls) + 60 feet (croissants) + 120 feet (baguettes) = 280 feet

The total length of the baked goods is 280 feet.

"To find the total number of bananas needed for 2 months, we need to calculate the total number of bananas needed for each type of ape and then add them together.

The monkeys need 200 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 200 * 2 = 400 bananas.

The gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 400 * 2 = 800 bananas.

The baboons need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, let's add the total number of bananas needed for each type of ape: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he's running back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 80 = 160 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she ran is 200 + (34 * 160) = 200 + 5440 = 5640 yards.

Since 5640 is greater than 3000, Kelly is the winner.

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract the distance Blake ran from the distance Kelly ran: 5640 - 3000 = 2640 yards.

"To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin, we need to add the number of starfish, sea horses, and clownfish he caught. 

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 

Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Now, let's find the number of fish caught by Locsin. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Now, let's find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin. 

Total fish caught = Total fish caught by Anakin + Total fish caught by Locsin
Total fish caught = 19 + 13
Total fish caught = 32

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price increase every two months and then add it to the original price. 

The original price of the bag of marbles is $20. 

After 2 months, the price increases by 20% of $20, which is 0.20 * $20 = $4. 
So, the price after 2 months is $20 + $4 = $24.

After 4 months, the price increases by 20% of $24, which is 0.20 * $24 = $4.80. 
So, the price after 4 months is $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.

After 6 months, the price increases by 20% of $28.80, which is 0.20 * $28.80 = $5.76. 
So, the price after 6 months is $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56.

After 8 months, the price increases by 20% of $34.56, which is 0.20 * $34.56 = $6.912. 
So, the price after 8 months is $34.56 + $6.912 = $41.472.

After 10 months, the price increases by 20% of $41.472, which is 0.20 * $41.472 = $8.2944. 
So, the price after 10 months is $41.472 + $8.2944 = $49.7664.

After 12 months, the price increases by 20% of $49.7664, which is 0.20 * $49.7664 = $9.95328. 
So, the price after 12 months is $49.7664 + $9.95328 = $59.71968.

After 14 months, the price increases by 20% of $59.71968, which is 0.20 * $59.71968 = $11.943936. 
So, the price after 14 months is $59.71968 + $11.943936 = $71.663616.

After 16 months, the price increases by 20% of $71.663616, which is 0.20 * $71.663616 = $14.3327232. 
So, the price after 16 months is $71.663616 + $14.3327232 = $85.9963392.

After 18 months, the price increases by 20% of $85.9963392, which is 0.20 * $85.9963392 = $17.19926784.

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can write an equation:

S = 2B

In 2 years, their ages will be B + 2 and S + 2. According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write another equation:

(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28

Substituting S = 2B into the second equation, we get:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

The cost of the jacket is three times as much as the hat, so it is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. The average cost of the pants is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

The final answer is: $150"
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each group and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of legs for the spiders:
80 spiders * 8 legs/spider = 640 legs

Next, let's calculate the number of legs for the insects:
90 insects * 6 legs/insect = 540 legs

Now, let's calculate the number of legs for the rare mutant invertebrates:
3 invertebrates * 10 legs/invertebrate = 30 legs

Finally, let's add the number of legs for each group together:
640 legs + 540 legs + 30 legs = 1210 legs

The final answer is: 1210"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red.
2. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four.
3. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, and Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.

From point 3, we know Sally Four is 8 years old. 

From point 2, we can write an equation for Granny Red's age: 
Granny Red's age = 2 * Sally Four's age
Granny Red's age = 2 * 8
Granny Red's age = 16

From point 1, we can write an equation for Sally Two's age: 
Sally Two's age = Granny Red's age + 3
Sally Two's age = 16 + 3
Sally Two's age = 19

Now, we know the ages of Sally Four, Sally Two, and Granny Red. We still need to find the age of the fourth bird, but there is no information about the fourth bird's age. However, the question asks for the total age of the four birds. Since we have three of the four birds' ages, we can add them up and leave the fourth bird's age as a variable.

Total age of the four birds = Sally Four's age + Sally Two's age + Granny Red's age + unknown age
Total age of the four birds = 8 + 19 + 16 + x

However, since we are asked for a numerical answer, we need to realize that the question is incomplete or has missing information about the fourth bird's age. Without knowing the age of the fourth bird, we cannot provide a numerical answer."
"To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to calculate the total monthly payments and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the increased minimum payments:

- Student loans: $300 * 1.5 = $450
- Credit card: $200 * 1.5 = $300
- Mortgage: $500 * 1.5 = $750

Now, let's add up the increased minimum payments:
$450 + $300 + $750 = $1500

Since Jessica pays this amount every month, we multiply it by 12 to find the total annual payment:
$1500 * 12 = $18,000

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To find the total time it takes Billy to peel and cut all the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes, and then add the time it takes to cut one potato multiplied by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds = 5/60 minutes (converting seconds to minutes)

Total time to peel all potatoes: 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes/potato = 90 minutes
Total time to cut all potatoes: 60 potatoes * (5/60) minutes/potato = 5 minutes

Total time to peel and cut all potatoes: 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

The final answer is: 95"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much they made in total from selling the lemonade, and then find out how much they spent on lemons.

Let's start by finding out how much they made in total from selling the lemonade. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so they make $0.50 * 20 = $10 per gallon. 

Since they made a profit of $25, and they sell each gallon for $10, the total revenue from selling the lemonade is $25 + (cost of lemons + cost of sugar). 

The cost of sugar is $2 per gallon, and the cost of lemons is $3 per gallon. Let's denote the number of gallons as 'x'. Then the total cost is 3x + 2x = 5x.

The total revenue is 10x (since they make $10 per gallon). The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, so we can set up the equation:

10x - 5x = 25

Simplifying the equation, we get:

5x = 25

Dividing both sides by 5, we get:

x = 5

So they made 5 gallons of lemonade.

Now that we know they made 5 gallons, we can find out how much they spent on lemons. The cost of lemons is $3 per gallon, so they spent 3 * 5 = $15 on lemons.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the number of Chinese participants, we first need to subtract the number of Japanese participants from the total number of participants. 

Total participants = 240
Japanese participants = 80
Chinese participants = Total participants - Japanese participants
Chinese participants = 240 - 80
Chinese participants = 160

Since we know that the number of boys on the Chinese team was 60, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of girls = Chinese participants - Number of boys
Number of girls = 160 - 60
Number of girls = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the amount of money Zaid has left after all expenses and donations, we need to follow the order of operations.

1. Zaid earns 6000$ per month.
2. He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent: 1/4 * 6000 = 1500$
3. He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel: 1/3 * 6000 = 2000$
4. The remaining amount after rent and car fuel is: 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500$
5. He donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity: 1/2 * 2500 = 1250$
6. The remaining amount after donation is: 2500 - 1250 = 1250$
7. He gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$, so the total amount given away is: 200 + 700 = 900$
8. The final amount Zaid has left is: 1250 - 900 = 350$

The final answer is: $350"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of crabs each person has and then add them together.

We know that Bo has 40 crabs.

Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.

Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, we add the number of crabs each person has to find the total number of crabs:

40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122

The final answer is: 122"
"To find out how much Lloyd earned in the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd tutored 5 hours at $10 per hour, so his earnings for the first week are:
5 hours * $10/hour = $50

For the second week, Lloyd tutored 8 hours at $10 per hour, so his earnings for the second week are:
8 hours * $10/hour = $80

Now, we add his earnings for the first and second weeks together:
$50 + $80 = $130

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the number of votes the loser got, we first need to find the number of votes the winner got. Since the winner got 3/4 of the votes, we can multiply the total number of students who voted (80) by 3/4.

Winner's votes = 3/4 * 80
Winner's votes = (3 * 80) / 4
Winner's votes = 240 / 4
Winner's votes = 60

Now, we know the winner got 60 votes. To find the number of votes the loser got, we subtract the winner's votes from the total number of votes.

Loser's votes = Total votes - Winner's votes
Loser's votes = 80 - 60
Loser's votes = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses is 4x.

We are also given that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, which is 5x.

We know that the total number of pink calla lilies is 200, so we can set up the equation 5x = 200 to find the value of x.

Solving for x, we get x = 200 / 5 = 40.

Now that we know the value of x, we can find the number of red roses by multiplying x by 4: 4x = 4 * 40 = 160.

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final answer is: 160"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

From point 3, we know Jan's current age is 30. 

Two years ago, Jan's age would have been 30 - 2 = 28.

From point 2, we know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 28 / 2 = 14. 

So, two years ago, Mark's age would have been 14 + 5 = 19.

Since Mark was 19 two years ago, his current age would be 19 + 2 = 21.

From point 1, we know that Jean is two years older than Mark. Therefore, Jean's current age would be 21 + 2 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time for each team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them up.

The well-rounded team's total time is 4 x 55 seconds = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner runs 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's total time is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, and then find the difference between them.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is the probability of rolling a 4, 5, or 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5, since there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25 or 25%.

Now, we need to find the difference between the two probabilities. The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 50% and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 25%. The difference is 50% - 25% = 25%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To find out how many apples Jenna picked, we need to determine half of the number of apples her mom picked. Since her mom picked 20 apples, we can calculate Jenna's share by dividing 20 by 2.

20 / 2 = 10

Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom picked 20, Jenna picked 10 apples.

To find the total number of apples they both picked, we need to add the number of apples Jenna picked to the number of apples her mom picked.

20 (mom's apples) + 10 (Jenna's apples) = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of small rodents (rats and hamsters) and the total number of straw pieces given to them. We know that 160 pieces of straw are distributed among the small rodents.

Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'r'. Since there are 3 cages of rats, the total number of rats is 3r.

The number of hamsters is given as 10.

The total number of small rodents is the sum of the number of rats and hamsters: 3r + 10.

Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. The total number of straw pieces given to the small rodents is 160. We can set up the equation:

6(3r) + 5(10) = 160

Simplifying the equation:

18r + 50 = 160

Subtract 50 from both sides:

18r = 110

Divide both sides by 18:

r = 110 / 18
r = 110/18
r = 55/9
r = 6.11 (approximately)

However, since the number of rats must be a whole number, we need to find the closest whole number that satisfies the equation. We can try r = 6:

18(6) + 50 = 108 + 50 = 158 (not equal to 160)

We can try r = 7:

18(7) + 50 = 126 + 50 = 176 (greater than 160)

Since r = 6 is too low and r = 7 is too high, we can try r = 6.11, which is approximately equal to 6.11. However, since we are looking for a whole number, we can round down to 6 and check if it satisfies the equation.

However, we can also try r = 6.11, which is approximately equal to 6.11. However, since we are looking for a whole number, we can round down to 6 and check if it satisfies the equation.

"To calculate the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest accrued over 3 months and add it to the principal amount.

The formula for simple interest is: Interest = Principal x Rate x Time

Given:
Principal (P) = $100
Rate (R) = 2% or 0.02 (as a decimal)
Time (T) = 3 months

Interest = P x R x T
= $100 x 0.02 x 3
= $6

Now, we add the interest to the principal amount:
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
= $100 + $6
= $106

So, Mandy should pay Benedict $106.

The final answer is: $106"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total cost of buying the bags of wheat and the total cost of transporting them. Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'.

The cost of buying the bags is $20x.

The cost of transporting each bag is $2, so the total cost of transportation is $2x.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of buying and the cost of transportation: $20x + $2x = $22x.

The trader sold the bags at a rate of $30 each, so the total revenue is $30x.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: $30x - $22x = $8x.

We are given that the profit is $400, so we can set up the equation: $8x = $400.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8: x = $400 / $8 = 50.

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide it by 3.

First, let's find the cost of the food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. Since they spent $20.25 on tickets, the cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

The cost of the rides is 2 rides * $33 per ride = $66.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3: $102 / 3 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total number of peaches John collects, we need to calculate the total minutes he works and then multiply it by the number of peaches he collects per minute.

Since John collects peaches for 3 hours, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, we know John collects 2 peaches per minute. To find the total number of peaches, we multiply the total minutes by the peaches per minute:

180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ducks needs per day, we need to first calculate the total pounds of insects needed per week for the flock, and then divide that by 7 to get the daily amount.

The total pounds of insects needed per week for the flock is 3.5 pounds per duck multiplied by 10 ducks, which is 3.5 * 10 = 35 pounds per week.

Now, to find the daily amount, we divide the total pounds per week by 7: 35 pounds / 7 days = 5 pounds per day.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of trees Tom has left, we need to calculate the net change in the number of trees over 10 years.

Initially, Tom has 50 trees.

Each year, he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, resulting in a net gain of 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year.

Over 10 years, the net gain is 8 * 10 = 80 trees.

So, the total number of trees after 10 years is 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we multiply 130 by 0.3 (which is 30% as a decimal).

Number of trees that die = 130 * 0.3 = 39

Now, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years to find the final number of trees Tom has left.

Number of trees left = 130 - 39 = 91

The final answer is: 91"
"To find the number of pink and white flamingos, we need to break down the events step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out. So, the number of pink flamingos left is 18 - 6 = 12, and the number of white flamingos is 6.

On Sunday morning, the neighbors added 18 more pink flamingos to the collection. So, the total number of pink flamingos is now 12 + 18 = 30, and the number of white flamingos remains 6.

At noon on Sunday, the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos is 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how many crayons Violetta can buy, we need to divide the amount of money she has by the cost of one crayon. 

Number of crayons = Total money / Cost of one crayon
Number of crayons = $20 / $2
Number of crayons = 10

Since Violetta needs 5 different colors, she can buy 2 crayons of each color.

Total number of crayons bought = 2 * 5
Total number of crayons bought = 10

Since Violetta bought 10 crayons and she only needed 5 different colors, she has 5 extra crayons.

Change = Total money - (Cost of crayons bought * Number of crayons bought)
Change = $20 - ($2 * 10)
Change = $20 - $20
Change = $0

However, this is not the case because Violetta bought 10 crayons and she only needed 5 different colors. She has 5 extra crayons, but she still needs to pay for them. 

Cost of extra crayons = Number of extra crayons * Cost of one crayon
Cost of extra crayons = 5 * $2
Cost of extra crayons = $10

Change = Total money - (Cost of crayons bought + Cost of extra crayons)
Change = $20 - ($20 + $10)
Change = $20 - $30
Change = -$10

Since we cannot have a negative change, this means Violetta does not have enough money to buy 10 crayons. She can only buy 5 crayons.

Total money = $20
Cost of 5 crayons = 5 * $2
Cost of 5 crayons = $10

Change = Total money - Cost of 5 crayons
Change = $20 - $10
Change = $10

The final answer is: $10"
"To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser, since a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined.

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30

Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens.
Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to calculate the total pounds of carrots that will be used by the restaurants and subtract that from the total pounds of carrots available.

Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. 

Total pounds of carrots used = Number of restaurants * Pounds per restaurant
Total pounds of carrots used = 40 * 2
Total pounds of carrots used = 80 pounds

Now, we subtract the total pounds of carrots used from the total pounds of carrots available to find out how many pounds will not be used.

Pounds not used = Total pounds of carrots available - Total pounds of carrots used
Pounds not used = 200 - 80
Pounds not used = 120

"To find the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and add them to the initial number of cards.

Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times the initial number of cards: 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month: 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months: (60 + 40) * 2 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the cards from each month and the initial number of cards: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 cards.

The final answer is: 320"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher as x. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, x is the same for both.

Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, so the total amount Mark earns from Publisher A is 5x cents.

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 2 * 5 = 10 cents per sentence. The total amount Mark earns from Publisher B is 10x cents.

The total number of sentences Mark edits each week is 1000, and he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, so x + x = 1000. This simplifies to 2x = 1000.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 2: x = 1000 / 2 = 500.

Now that we know x, we can find the total amount Mark earns from each publisher. From Publisher A, he earns 5x = 5 * 500 = 2500 cents. From Publisher B, he earns 10x = 10 * 500 = 5000 cents.

The total amount Mark earns in a week is the sum of what he earns from both publishers: 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

The final answer is: 7500"

"To find the total amount John made that year, we need to calculate his new salary after the 5% raise and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise on his weekly salary:
5% of $2000 = 0.05 * $2000 = $100

New weekly salary = $2000 + $100 = $2100

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply his new weekly salary by 52:
Total annual salary = $2100 * 52 = $109200

Now, let's add the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to his total annual salary:
Total amount made that year = $109200 + $5000 = $114200

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish separately and then add them together.

For sandwiches, Carl ate 1 sandwich per day for 7 days, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. So, the total slices used for sandwiches = 7 days * 2 slices/day = 14 slices.

For omelets, Carl ate 3 omelets, using 1 more slice per omelet than per sandwich. So, the number of slices per omelet = 2 + 1 = 3 slices. The total slices used for omelets = 3 omelets * 3 slices/omelet = 9 slices.

For the macaroni and cheese dish, Carl used 8 slices.

Now, let's add the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish together: 14 slices (sandwiches) + 9 slices (omelets) + 8 slices (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices.

"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the number of blue and red pens she bought and add them to the initial number of pens she had.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so she had a total of 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag, so she bought 6 x 9 = 54 blue pens.

She bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag, so she bought 2 x 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, let's add the number of blue and red pens she bought to the initial number of pens she had: 54 + 12 = 66.

Adding the blue and red pens to the initial number of pens, we get: 32 + 66 = 98.

Janet now has 98 pens.

"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to find the total score she needs for the semester. Since there are six tests and she wants an average of 93, we multiply 93 by 6 to get the total score.

Total score needed = 93 * 6
Total score needed = 558

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score from the average, we need to find the total of the five scores she has so far, and then add the score she needs on the sixth test to reach the total score needed.

The total of the five scores Brinley has so far is:
89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 338

Now, we subtract the total of the five scores from the total score needed to find the score she needs on the sixth test:
Score needed on the sixth test = Total score needed - Total of the five scores
Score needed on the sixth test = 558 - 338
Score needed on the sixth test = 220

"To find the total number of kilometers Michael rode his bike, we need to calculate the total kilometers for the first four weeks and the total kilometers for the next three weeks, then add them together.

In the first four weeks, Michael rode 5 times a week for 4 weeks. So, the total number of times he rode in the first four weeks is 5 * 4 = 20 times. Since he rode 25 kilometers each time, the total kilometers for the first four weeks is 20 * 25 = 500 kilometers.

In the next three weeks, Michael rode 2 times a week for 3 weeks. So, the total number of times he rode in the next three weeks is 2 * 3 = 6 times. Since he rode 60 kilometers each time, the total kilometers for the next three weeks is 6 * 60 = 360 kilometers.

Now, we add the total kilometers for the first four weeks and the next three weeks: 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

25 * 40g = 1000g

Next, let's find the weight of the candied apples. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, the weight of each candied apple is:
40g / 2 = 20g

Now, let's find the total weight of the candied apples:
80 * 20g = 1600g

Finally, let's add the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, half a dozen plates will cost 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

We are also given that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since there are 24 cups in a dozen, twenty dozen cups will be 20 * 24 = 480 cups.

To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups: $34,800 / 480 = $72.50.

The final answer is: $72.50"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy and the total amount of money she has earned from babysitting. 

The total cost of the items is the cost of the jacket plus the cost of 2 pairs of shoes: 
$30 (jacket) + 2 * $20 (shoes) = $30 + $40 = $70

Sara already has $10 saved, and she earns $5 each time she babysits. To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she already has from the total cost:
$70 (total cost) - $10 (initial savings) = $60

Since Sara earns $5 each time she babysits, we need to find out how many times she needs to babysit to earn $60:
$60 (amount needed) / $5 (babysitting pay) = 12 times

However, we also need to consider that Sara earns money from mowing the lawn. Her parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn, we need to subtract the amount she earns from babysitting from the amount she needs:
$60 (amount needed) - $60 (babysitting earnings) = $0

Since she already has enough money from babysitting, she doesn't need to mow the lawn at all.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42, and each red chicken produces 3 eggs and each white chicken produces 5 eggs. So, we can set up the equation:

3R + 5W = 42

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

"To find the time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle, as he walks around the edge. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the dimensions of the park, l = 6 miles and w = 1.5 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the perimeter by his speed:

Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of customers Sloane counted on the first day. Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so the number of customers on the second day is x + 50.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500, which is the sum of the customers on the first and second days. We can write the equation:

x + (x + 50) = 500

Combine like terms:

2x + 50 = 500

Subtract 50 from both sides:

2x = 450

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 225

So, Sloane counted 225 customers on the first day. 

Now, we need to find the number of customers she counted on the third day. We already know that the total number of customers by the third day was 500, and we know that the number of customers on the first day was 225. We can find the number of customers on the second day by subtracting 225 from 500:

500 - 225 = 275

Since the number of customers on the second day is 275, and she counted 50 more customers than the first day, we can find the number of customers on the third day by adding 50 to 275:

275 + 50 = 325

"Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, the rate of change of water in each pool is -4 gallons/minute. 

The time elapsed is 4 minutes, so the change in water in each pool is -4 * 4 = -16 gallons.

The current amount of water in the small pool is x - 16 gallons.

The current amount of water in the big pool is 2x - 16 gallons.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-16 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

24 = x

The initial amount of water in the small pool is 24 gallons. 

The current amount of water in the small pool is 24 - 16 = 8 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months and then subtract that from the initial amount borrowed plus the additional 10% interest.

First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months:

Monthly payment = $165
Number of months = 12
Total amount paid = Monthly payment * Number of months
Total amount paid = $165 * 12
Total amount paid = $1980

Next, let's calculate the total amount Janeth needs to pay, including the interest:

Initial amount borrowed = $2000
Interest = 10% of $2000 = 0.1 * $2000 = $200
Total amount to be paid = Initial amount borrowed + Interest
Total amount to be paid = $2000 + $200
Total amount to be paid = $2200

Now, let's calculate the remaining balance:

Remaining balance = Total amount to be paid - Total amount paid
Remaining balance = $2200 - $1980
Remaining balance = $220

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the current ages of Adrian and Zack. 

Since Harriet is 21 years old, and she is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is twice Harriet's age. 
Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age = 2 * 21 = 42 years.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age = 3 * 21 = 63 years.

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet's age in 3 years = 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack's age in 3 years = 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian's age in 3 years = 63 + 3 = 66 years

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:

Naomi scored 68 points. 
Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. 
Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 
Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. 
Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

We know that the total points scored by the four students is 251.

The company spends a third of $15000 on advertising for the second year. To find a third of $15000, we divide $15000 by 3.

$15000 / 3 = $5000

Now, we add the amount spent in the first year to the amount spent in the second year to find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years.

$15000 + $5000 = $20000

The total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."
"To find the total cost of the rentals, we need to calculate the cost for Carlos and Benji separately and then add them together.

Carlos rents the canoe for $30 an hour and uses it for 3 hours. The cost for Carlos is 30 * 3 = $90.

Benji rents the banana boat raft for $18 an hour and uses it for 5 hours. The cost for Benji is 18 * 5 = $90.

The total cost for both Carlos and Benji is 90 + 90 = $180.

"To find the total number of days Andrew will travel, we need to calculate the total number of days for the trip to Rochester by bus and the return trip from Rochester by car.

The trip to Rochester by bus takes 6 days. 
The trip from New Jersey to Rochester by car takes half as many days as the bus trip, which is 6 / 2 = 3 days.

Since Andrew will be traveling to Rochester by bus and returning from Rochester by car, we need to add the number of days for each trip. 
Total days = 6 (bus trip to Rochester) + 3 (car trip from New Jersey to Rochester) + 3 (car trip from Rochester to New Jersey) = 12

"To find the probability of picking a water type card, we need to first calculate the total number of cards James has after losing 8 water type and buying 14 grass type.

Initially, James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. 

After losing 8 water type cards, he has:
- 30 (fire type) + 20 (grass type) + (40 - 8) (water type) = 30 + 20 + 32 = 82 cards

After buying 14 grass type cards, he has:
- 30 (fire type) + (20 + 14) (grass type) + 32 (water type) = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 cards

Now, the probability of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards.

Probability = (Number of water type cards) / (Total number of cards) = 32 / 96

To find the percentage, we multiply the probability by 100:
(32 / 96) * 100 = 33.333...

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance of picking a water type card is 33."
"To find out how much Chad still owes, we need to calculate the total cost of his meal and then subtract the gift card amount.

The base burrito is $6.50. 
He adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each, so 2 * $0.25 = $0.50. 
The total cost of the extra items is $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50.
The total cost of the meal before the upgrade is $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00.
He upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, so the new total is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.
He has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract this from the total: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To find the total number of pieces Kalinda and her mom can place per minute, we need to determine how many pieces her mom can place per minute. Since her mom can place half as many pieces as Kalinda, and Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute, her mom can place 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

The total number of pieces they can place per minute is 4 (Kalinda) + 2 (her mom) = 6 pieces per minute.

To find the total time it will take to complete the puzzle, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place per minute. 

360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time from minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

"To find the number of melons not ready to be harvested after two weeks, we need to calculate the number of melons harvested in the first and second trips.

Initially, 30% of 120 melons were ready for harvest, so the number of melons taken home in the first trip is 0.3 * 120 = 36.

The remaining melons after the first trip are 120 - 36 = 84.

In the second trip, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready for harvest, so the number of melons taken home in the second trip is (3/4) * 84 = 63.

The total number of melons harvested is 36 + 63 = 99.

The number of melons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is 120 - 99 = 21.

"To find out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we first need to determine how many shells she collected on Monday. 

Since Robert collects 20 shells on Monday and Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, we can calculate Kylie's Monday collection as follows:
Kylie's Monday collection = Robert's Monday collection + 5
Kylie's Monday collection = 20 + 5
Kylie's Monday collection = 25

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday.

"To find the number of penguins left sunbathing, we need to calculate the number of penguins that jumped in the ocean and the number that went inside the cave, and then subtract that from the total number of penguins.

One-third of the penguins jumped in the ocean, so that's 36 / 3 = 12 penguins.

Another one-third of the penguins went inside the cave, so that's also 36 / 3 = 12 penguins.

The total number of penguins that left the snow is 12 + 12 = 24 penguins.

To find the number of penguins left sunbathing, we subtract the number of penguins that left from the total number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12 penguins.

"To find out how many vines Steve needs, we first need to determine how many tomatoes he eats per week. Since he eats 6 tomatoes per day, we multiply this by 7 to get the weekly amount:

6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we can assume his girlfriend eats half as much as him. So, she eats:

42 tomatoes/week / 2 = 21 tomatoes/week

Now, we add Steve's and his girlfriend's weekly consumption to get the total:

42 tomatoes/week + 21 tomatoes/week = 63 tomatoes/week

Since a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, we divide the total weekly consumption by the number of tomatoes per vine:

63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines

"To find out how many pizzas John needs to order, we need to calculate the total number of slices required and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

First, let's calculate the total number of slices required:
20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices

Since pizzas are sold in 8 slices, we need to divide the total number of slices required by 8 to find out how many pizzas John needs to order:
80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas

So, John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many new pens Ram can make from the 25 pens he buys. Since he can make one full pen from the ink of five empty pens, we can divide the total number of pens by 5 to find out how many new pens he can make.

25 pens / 5 pens per new pen = 5 new pens

Since Ram starts with 25 pens and makes 5 new pens, we need to add the initial number of pens to the number of new pens he makes.

25 (initial pens) + 5 (new pens) = 30 pens

So, Ram gets to have 30 pens in total.

"To find the final amount of money Johnny had after a year, we need to follow the steps:

1. Johnny started with $20 and added an extra $10, so the total amount he had initially is $20 + $10 = $30.
2. This sum of $30 tripled in a year, which means it became 3 times the initial amount.
3. To find the final amount, we multiply the initial amount by 3: $30 * 3 = $90.

The final amount of money Johnny had after a year is $90."
"To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we need to determine the ages of Mary and Joan first.

Since Jessa is 20 years old, and Joan is five years older than Jessa, we can calculate Joan's age as follows:
Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5
Joan's age = 20 + 5
Joan's age = 25

Now, we know that Mary is two years younger than Joan, so we can calculate Mary's age as follows:
Mary's age = Joan's age - 2
Mary's age = 25 - 2
Mary's age = 23

Now that we have the ages of all three girls, we can find the sum of their ages:
Sum of ages = Jessa's age + Joan's age + Mary's age
Sum of ages = 20 + 25 + 23
Sum of ages = 68

"To find the total number of hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he receives and responds to, and then multiply it by the time it takes him to write one page.

First, let's find the number of letters Mike receives from his remaining 3 pen pals. Since each of them sends 2 letters a week, the total number of letters he receives is:
3 pen pals * 2 letters/week/pen pal = 6 letters/week

Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week.

Now, let's find the total number of pages he writes in a week. Since each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages is:
6 letters/week * 5 pages/letter = 30 pages/week

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is:
30 pages/week * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes/week

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
180 minutes/week / 60 = 3 hours/week

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries.

Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin. So, Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which means Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Ginger gave Griffin some fries, and then Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken. Since Kyle took 5 fries, Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries.

After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had 9 - 2 = 7 fries. But we know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. This means that Ginger gave Griffin 27 - 7 = 20 fries.

"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as x. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2(2x)

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

14 = 2x

Now, divide both sides by 2:

7 = x

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for each day, then multiply it by the number of days, and finally multiply it by the number of weeks. 

The makeup artist charges $250 an hour and works 6 hours a day. So, the cost for each day is $250 * 6 = $1500.

Since she needs it done 4 times a week, the cost for each week is $1500 * 4 = $6000.

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so the total cost before the discount is $6000 * 5 = $30,000.

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 0.10: $30,000 * 0.10 = $3000.

The final cost after the discount is $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000.

"To find out how many cookies Sue ate on Monday and Tuesday, we need to calculate her sister's cookie consumption first. 

Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday. 

Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, she ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so she ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, the total calories consumed by Sue = 46 * 200 = 9200 calories.

The total calories consumed by her sister = 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

The difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister = 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories.

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the school. Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60.

Given that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls, the total number of girls in the school is 15 + 12 = 27.

Since the school is 50% girls, the number of girls represents half of the total students. Therefore, the total number of students in the school is 27 * 2 = 54. However, we know that the total number of students is 60, so this is an error in our calculation. The correct total number of students is indeed 60.

Since the school has 60 students and 27 of them are girls, the number of boys is 60 - 27 = 33.

The first class has 20 students, and 15 of them are girls, so the number of boys in the first class is 20 - 15 = 5. The second class has 20 students, and 12 of them are girls, so the number of boys in the second class is 20 - 12 = 8.

The total number of boys in the first two classes is 5 + 8 = 13. Since the total number of boys in the school is 33, the number of boys in the third class is 33 - 13 = 20.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. 

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's represent the number of cougars killed today as 'x'. Then, the number of wolves killed today is 3x.

We also know that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, the number of cougars killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since we know the number of cougars killed today is 12, we can set up the equation 3x = 12 to find the number of wolves killed today. Solving for x, we get x = 4.

Now that we know x, we can find the number of wolves killed today by multiplying 3 and x, which is 3 * 4 = 12.

The total number of wolves killed is 10 (last night) + 12 (today) = 22.

The total number of cougars killed is 15 (last night) + 12 (today) = 27.

The total number of animals killed is 22 (wolves) + 27 (cougars) = 49.

To find out how many cows each stall got, we divide 40 by 10: 
40 / 10 = 4

So, each stall got 4 new cows. 

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. We know that each stall has 20 original cows and 4 new cows. 

First, we find out how many cows are in one stall: 
20 (original cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows per stall

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the total weight of the wood and then subtract the weight of the wood that termites ate.

First, let's find the total weight of the redwood. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we need to divide the total height of the redwood (200 feet) by 10 to find the number of sections.

200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections

Now, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section to find the total weight of the redwood.

20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds

Next, we need to find the weight of the wood that termites ate. Since termites ate 30% of the wood, we need to find 30% of the total weight of the redwood.

30% of 8000 pounds = 0.30 * 8000 = 2400 pounds

2. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.
3. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits:

Apples: 52 (Andrea) + 44 (Jamal) = 96
Bananas: 24 (Andrea) + 48 (Jamal) = 72

"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we first need to determine how many cups are needed for each day. 

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens are in 36 cookies. 

36 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 3 dozen cookies

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 1 dozen cookies, we multiply the number of dozens by 2 to find the total cups needed for today:

3 dozen cookies * 2 cups per dozen = 6 cups

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. Again, we need to find out how many dozens are in 30 cookies:

30 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 2.5 dozen cookies

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 1 dozen cookies, we multiply the number of dozens by 2 to find the total cups needed for tomorrow:

2.5 dozen cookies * 2 cups per dozen = 5 cups

"To find the total dollar amount of two-thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to first calculate two-thirds of 9,300.

Two-thirds of 9,300 can be calculated as (2/3) * 9,300.

To multiply a fraction by a number, we multiply the numerator (2) by the number (9,300) and keep the denominator (3) the same.

(2 * 9,300) / 3 = 18,600 / 3

Now, we divide 18,600 by 3 to get the result.

18,600 / 3 = 6,200

   Then, we add 5 to that: 6 + 5 = 11
   So, Harry has 11 trees.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard.
Harry has 11 trees, and Ferdinand has 3 trees.
The difference is 11 - 3 = 8

"To find the total amount of money the three girls have combined, we need to calculate the amount each girl has and then add them together.

Carmen has $100.
Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.
Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, let's add the amounts together: $100 + $125 + $175 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To find the total price of the house, we need to add the brokerage fee and the transfer fee to the selling price.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500.

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

The total price of the house is the sum of the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

To find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price: $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

The final answer is: $9,500"
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid in fees and subtract that from the selling price, then subtract the remaining loan amount.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 x $400,000 = $12,000.

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 x $400,000 = $20,000.

The total amount paid in fees is $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

Now, let's subtract the total fees from the selling price: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000.

Finally, let's subtract the remaining loan amount: $368,000 - $250,000 = $118,000.

The final answer is: $118,000"
"To find the time it takes to heat up to 400 degrees, we need to calculate 40% of 20 minutes and add it to 20 minutes. 

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. 
So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.

It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil, so the cooking time is 28 - 5 = 23 minutes.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is the sum of the time it takes to heat up to 400 degrees and the cooking time, which is 28 + 23 = 51 minutes.

The final answer is: 51"
"To find the total amount spent on newspaper ads, we multiply the cost of each newspaper ad by the number of newspaper ads: $5 * 50 = $250.

To find the total amount spent on television ads, we multiply the cost of each television ad by the number of television ads: $75 * 15 = $1125.

To find the total amount spent on all ads, we add the total amount spent on newspaper ads and the total amount spent on television ads: $250 + $1125 = $1375.

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and add them together.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag together: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

The final answer is: 762"
"To find the total number of windows, we need to calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows in each house.

Each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows. So, the total number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is 3 * 2 = 6.

There are 4 additional windows in each house not connected to bedrooms.

So, the total number of windows in one house is 6 (from bedrooms) + 4 (additional) = 10.

Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows is 10 * 2 = 20.

Change = $20 - $14.00 = $6.00

The final answer is: $6.00"
"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we first need to determine the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette. 

The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is 900 * 0.1 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is a 1800-stitch project, the total number of stitches used for the body and the sleeves is 1800 - 270 = 1530 stitches.

The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches, so the number of stitches used for the sleeves is 1530 - 900 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

The final answer is: 315"

The total cost of the seeds is $800 + $2400 = $3200.

The final numerical answer is: $3200"
"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each scene and the song, and then add them together.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

The final answer is: 138"
"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to find the number of cards that do not have the letters A, B, or C.

First, let's find the number of cards with the letter A: 
2/5 of 80 cards had the letter A, so the number of cards with A is (2/5) * 80 = 32.

Now, we subtract the number of cards with A from the total number of cards to find the remaining cards: 
80 - 32 = 48.

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B: 
1/2 of the remaining 48 cards had the letter B, so the number of cards with B is (1/2) * 48 = 24.

Now, we subtract the number of cards with B from the remaining cards to find the number of cards that do not have A or B: 
48 - 24 = 24.

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter C: 
5/8 of the remaining 24 cards had the letter C, so the number of cards with C is (5/8) * 24 = 15.

Now, we subtract the number of cards with C from the remaining cards to find the number of cards with the letter D: 
24 - 15 = 9.

"To find the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

Time for small holes: 3 minutes per hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes
Time for large holes: 10 minutes per hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

Total time in minutes: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 
240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we first need to determine their current ages. Since the sum of their ages is 20, we can represent their ages as x and 20 - x.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be x + 10 and Marco's age will be (20 - x) + 10.

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (x + 10) + ((20 - x) + 10).

Simplifying the expression, we get:
x + 10 + 20 - x + 10
Combine like terms:
20 + 20
30 + 10
30 + 20 - x + x
30 + 20

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be 30 + 20.

"Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S. We are given two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: R = 6S
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: (R + 9) = 3(S + 9)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for S:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides:

3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides:

3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3:

S = 6

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars together: $5 + $2 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To find the total number of spots on the cobras, we multiply the number of cobras by the number of spots on each cobra: 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.

Since the mambas have half the number of spots as the cobras, we divide the number of spots on the cobras by 2 to find the number of spots on each mamba: 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

Now, we multiply the number of mambas by the number of spots on each mamba: 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.

To find the total number of spots on both cobras and mambas, we add the spots on the cobras and the mambas: 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

Finally, to find half the number of spots, we divide the total number of spots by 2: 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is: 2450"
"To find out how many people Maddy needs to buy pizza for, we need to calculate the total number of team members and their guests. 

There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of people from the team is 12 + 3 = 15. Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. 

The total number of people Maddy needs to buy pizza for is 15 (team members and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, the total number of pizzas Maddy needs to buy is 39 / 3 = 13.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total amount Maddy will spend is 13 * 15 = $195.

The final answer is: $195"
"To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we first need to calculate the total space occupied by the topaz gemstones and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace to find the space occupied by the silver beads.

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 gemstones per necklace. So, the total space occupied by the gemstones is 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. To find the space occupied by the silver beads, we subtract the space occupied by the gemstones from the total length of the necklace: 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Each silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find the number of silver beads, we divide the space occupied by the silver beads by the length of each bead: 17 / (1/4) = 17 * 4 = 68.

Total stories in the first week = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week. 

Alani doubled her stories: 20 * 2 = 40
Braylen doubled his stories: 40 * 2 = 80
Margot doubled her stories: 60 * 2 = 120

Total stories in the second week = 40 + 80 + 120 = 240

"To find the number of rows of 5-star, we first need to find the total number of stars in the flag and then subtract the number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows.

The total number of stars in the 8-star rows is 3 * 8 = 24.
The total number of stars in the 6-star rows is 2 * 6 = 12.

The total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36.

The total number of stars in the flag is 76.

The number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since it's traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, we can calculate it as:

Speed of car in slow lane = 60 miles/hour / 2
Speed of car in slow lane = 30 miles/hour

Now, we know the distance covered by both cars is the same, which is 480 miles. We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

For the car in the fast lane:
Time = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour
Time = 8 hours

Since the car in the slow lane travels at half the speed, it will take twice the time to cover the same distance. Therefore, the time taken by the car in the slow lane is:

Time = 2 * 8 hours
Time = 16 hours

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ali has 22 medals.
2. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.
3. Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.
4. Together, they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting, which means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.

Let's represent the total number of medals given out as 'x'. Then, we can write the equation:

x = 10 * 39

To find the total number of medals given out, we multiply 10 by 39.

x = 10 * 39

"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

First, let's find the total time she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

Total time worked = 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the total time to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:

150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her hourly wage:

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

"To find the total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed, we need to first calculate their points after the fourth round.

Initially, Mike has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point. Now Mike has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
Jim has 18 points, so he does not get an extra point. Jim still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point. Now Tony has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's calculate the total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed:
Mike has 22 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points.
Total points = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83

"To find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then divide the total amount of rice available by that amount.

First, let's calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day. Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 3 meals per day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). Since 5 members of the household eat rice every lunch and dinner, we can assume they also eat it for breakfast. So, the total number of people eating rice per day is 5.

The total amount of rice consumed per day is:
5 people * 0.2 kg/person/meal * 3 meals/day = 3 kg/day

Now, let's calculate the total amount of rice available:
42 kg

To find out how many days the rice will last, we can divide the total amount of rice available by the amount consumed per day:
42 kg / 3 kg/day = 14 days

Since we want to know how many weeks the rice will last, we can divide the number of days by 7:
14 days / 7 days/week = 2 weeks

"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first need to calculate the total number of crates he sold in the week. 

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he sold crates on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and the weekend (Saturday and Sunday). 

He sold 20 crates over the weekend. 
On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates. 
On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates. 
On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.

Total crates sold = 20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) 
Total crates sold = 65

Since Sam's target was 120 crates, we subtract the total crates sold from the target to find out how many crates he was off from his target.

Crates off target = Target - Total crates sold 
Crates off target = 120 - 65 
Crates off target = 55

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. A standard tabloid has 32 pages.
2. When folded, the paper is folded vertically, creating two halves.
3. Each half will have 16 pages (since 32 / 2 = 16).
4. When unfolded, the pages are arranged as follows: 
   - Left back: page 1
   - Left front: page 2
   - Right back: page 32
   - Right front: page 31
   - Then, the pattern continues with the remaining pages, alternating between the left and right sides.
5. Since each half has 16 pages, and we have two halves, we need to consider the total number of pages in both halves.
6. However, the question asks for the number of pieces of paper, not the number of pages. Since each piece of paper is used to create two pages (one on the front and one on the back), we need to divide the total number of pages by 2.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pieces of paper needed:

Total pages = 32
Pages per piece of paper = 2
Total pieces of paper = Total pages / Pages per piece of paper
Total pieces of paper = 32 / 2
Total pieces of paper = 16

2. Unsold books = 50
3. Books sold this year = 45
4. Books sold in the first year = 2 * Books sold this year = 2 * 45 = 90
5. Books sold in the second year = Total books - Unsold books - Books sold this year - Books sold in the first year
   = 250 - 50 - 45 - 90
   = 65

Since each book sells at $20, the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
Total money earned in the second year = Books sold in the second year * Price per book
= 65 * 20
= 1300

The final answer is: $1300"
"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week: 
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Since Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

Since the company performed well for the whole month, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week. 
So, his total weekly earnings are:
$500/week (hourly wage) + $300/week (bonus) = $800/week

April has 4 weeks. 
So, Watson's total earnings in April are:
$800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

The final answer is: $3200"
"To find out how many people John lost to, we need to calculate 20% of 20, since he beats 80% of the people he arm wrestled.

20% of 20 is calculated as 0.20 * 20 = 4.

So, John lost to 4 people. 

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we first need to determine how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 

Two-thirds of 60 is calculated as (2/3) * 60 = (2 * 60) / 3 = 120 / 3 = 40.

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning. 

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

The total number of loaves produced is 60, and 40 are sold in the morning. 

The number of loaves left is 60 - 40 = 20.

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. 

Half of 20 is calculated as (1/2) * 20 = 20 / 2 = 10.

So, 10 loaves are sold in the afternoon.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much weight Joey loses in a single week. 

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much he loses in a week, we divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks: 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, we multiply the number of weeks it takes Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey by the amount of weight Joey loses in a week: 4 weeks * 2 pounds/week = 8 pounds.

However, the question asks for the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, not the amount of weight itself. Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a week, the answer is 4 weeks.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

The original price of one tub of ice cream is $13, and it's now sold at $11. The discount is $13 - $11 = $2 per tub.

Since you're buying 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings on ice cream will be 2 * $2 = $4.

The original price of one packet of milk is not given, but it's sold at a discount of $0.5. Let's assume the original price is x. The discount is $0.5, so the selling price is x - $0.5.

You're buying 4 packets of milk, so the total savings on milk will be 4 * ($x - $0.5). However, we don't know the original price of the milk packet, so we can't calculate the exact savings on milk.

But we can express the total savings as $4 (from ice cream) + 4 * ($x - $0.5) (from milk). However, we are missing the value of x.

If we assume the original price of the milk packet is $1, then the total savings will be $4 + 4 * ($1 - $0.5) = $4 + 4 * $0.5 = $4 + $2 = $6.

However, since we don't know the original price of the milk packet, we can't give an exact answer."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs grown after 15 days.

The person will grow an extra arm every 3 days. To find out how many arms they will grow in 15 days, we divide 15 by 3. 

15 / 3 = 5

So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

The person will grow an extra leg every 5 days. To find out how many legs they will grow in 15 days, we divide 15 by 5.

15 / 5 = 3

So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

To find the total number of new limbs, we add the number of extra arms and legs.

5 (extra arms) + 3 (extra legs) = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. Calculate the total cost of the business suits:
   Number of suits = 6
   Cost per suit = $100
   Total cost of suits = 6 * $100 = $600

2. Calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
   Number of suitcases = 3
   Cost per suitcase = $50
   Total cost of suitcases = 3 * $50 = $150

3. Calculate the cost of the flight ticket:
   Cost of a business suit = $100
   Flight ticket cost = 5 * $100 + $700 = $1500 + $700 = $2200

4. Calculate the total amount spent so far:
   Total spent = Cost of suits + Cost of suitcases + Cost of flight ticket
   Total spent = $600 + $150 + $2200 = $2950

5. Calculate the amount left after saving $2000:
   Total amount = $6000
   Amount saved = $2000
   Amount left = Total amount - Amount saved
   Amount left = $6000 - $2000 = $4000

6. Calculate the amount left to spend on gifts:
   Amount left for gifts = Amount left - Total spent
   Amount left for gifts = $4000 - $2950 = $1050

The final answer is: $1050"
"To find the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to first find the number of eggs consumed by each group and then add them together.

Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so the total number of eggs consumed by this group is 3 * 3 = 9 eggs per day.

The rest of the family members are 5 - 3 = 2 people. They eat 2 eggs each day, so the total number of eggs consumed by this group is 2 * 2 = 4 eggs per day.

The total number of eggs consumed by the family in a day is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week is 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

"To find Trent's age, we need to first find Jane's age, and then add 5 to it. 

Since Quinn is 30, and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, we can find Jane's age by subtracting 3 from Quinn's age: 
30 - 3 = 27

Now that we know Jane's age, we can find Trent's age by adding 5 to Jane's age: 
27 + 5 = 32

The final answer is: 32"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Noah's current age as N and the population of Chile now as P.

Since Cera is 46 years old now, six years ago, Cera's age was 46 - 6 = 40 years.

We are given that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so we can write the equation:

N - 6 = 0.5(40)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

N - 6 = 20

Adding 6 to both sides, we get:

N = 26

Now, we are given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. So, we can write the equation:

Population six years ago = 3000N

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now, so we can write the equation:

Population six years ago = 0.5P

Equating the two expressions, we get:

3000N = 0.5P

Substituting N = 26, we get:

3000(26) = 0.5P

Simplifying the equation, we get:

78000 = 0.5P

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

156000 = P

The final answer is: 156000"
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D, the number of players on the offense as O, and the number of players on the special teams as S.

We are given that there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, so we can write an equation:

O = 2D

We are also given that there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so we can write another equation:

S = D/2

We know that the total number of players on the team is 105, so we can write the equation:

D + O + S = 105

Substituting the expressions for O and S from the first two equations into the third equation, we get:

D + 2D + D/2 = 105

Combine like terms:

4.5D = 105

Divide both sides by 4.5:

D = 105 / 4.5
D = 23.33

Since the number of players must be a whole number, we round down to the nearest whole number, as you can't have a fraction of a player.

D = 23

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total number of people invited, we first need to calculate the number of people from the 2 families with 6 people and the 3 families with 4 people.

For the 2 families with 6 people, the total number of people is 2 * 6 = 12.
For the 3 families with 4 people, the total number of people is 3 * 4 = 12.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. So, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

Then, 1/4 of the people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments. 1/4 of 8 is 2. So, we subtract 2 from the number of people who couldn't come due to illness: 8 - 2 = 6.

Now, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come due to illness and previous commitments from the total number of people invited: 16 - 6 = 10.

"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, his father gave him 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 (initial marbles) + 20 (bought from Johanna) + 8 (given by his father) = 98 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 98 * 2 = 196 kgs.

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool first. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as the pool) is V = length * width * height.

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length (L) = 6 feet
- Width (W) = 4 feet
- Height (H) = 5 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:
V = L * W * H
V = 6 * 4 * 5
V = 120 cubic feet

Now that we have the volume, we can calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. 

Cost = Volume * Cost per cubic foot
Cost = 120 * 0.1
Cost = 12

The final answer is: $12"
"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of girls, nongendered children, and then add them to the number of boys.

Given that there are 30 boys, and the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, we can find the number of girls by multiplying the number of boys by 3:

Girls = 3 * 30 = 90

Next, we are told that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys. To find the number of nongendered children, we can multiply the number of boys by 1/10:

Nongendered children = 30 * (1/10) = 3

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:

Total children = 30 (boys) + 90 (girls) + 3 (nongendered children) = 123

The final answer is: 123"
"To solve this problem, we can use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Let's denote the number of electric poles as P and the number of electric wires as W. We are given that W = 45.

Using the ratio, we can set up a proportion:

P : W = 1 : 3
P : 45 = 1 : 3

We can cross-multiply to get:

P * 3 = 45 * 1
3P = 45

Now, we can solve for P by dividing both sides by 3:

P = 45 / 3
P = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required by the electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of people who left the party and then determine how many women are left.

First, let's find the total number of people who left the party. We know that 1/4 of the total number of people left, and 22 men stayed. Since there were 25 men initially, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3.

Let's denote the total number of people as x. Since 1/4 of the people left, 3/4 of the people stayed. We can set up the equation:

3/4x = 22 + 15 (since 15 women stayed)

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4/3:

x = (4/3)(22 + 15)
x = (4/3)(37)
x = 4 * 12.33
x = 49.33

However, x must be a whole number since it represents the total number of people. We can round x to the nearest whole number, but in this case, we can also check if the initial assumption of 1/4 of the people leaving is correct.

Let's check if 1/4 of 49 is indeed 12.25 (which is close to 12.33). If 1/4 of the people left, then 3/4 of the people stayed, which is 37.75. Since 22 men stayed, the number of women who stayed is 15. 

However, we know that 3 men left, so the total number of people who left is 3 + 15 = 18. If 1/4 of the people left, then 1/4 * 49 = 12.25, which is close to 12.25. However, we know that 18 people left, so the total number of people is actually 49.

Now, let's find the number of women who left. Since 1/4 of the people left, the number of women who left is 1/4 * 15 = 3.75, which is close to 4. However, we know that 3 men left, so the number of women who left is actually 4.

The number of women who left is 4, so the number of women who stayed is 15 - 4 = 11.

"To find the total number of pencils Jam has, we know she has 2 loose pencils and 3 boxes full of pencils. Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as 'x'. The total number of pencils Jam has is 2 (loose pencils) + 3x (pencils in the boxes). We are given that this total is 26. 

So, we can write the equation: 2 + 3x = 26

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: 
3x = 26 - 2
3x = 24

Now, we divide both sides by 3 to find the value of x:
x = 24 / 3
x = 8

This means each box has 8 pencils. Now, we know Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each, so she has 3 * 8 = 24 pencils in the boxes. Adding the 2 loose pencils, Jam has a total of 24 + 2 = 26 pencils.

We are also given that Meg has 46 pencils. To find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have, we add their pencils together: 26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72 pencils.

Since each box has 8 pencils, we need to find how many boxes are needed to store 72 pencils. We divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box:
72 / 8 = 9

So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees and then calculate the total weakening effect of the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can divide 65 by 13 to get the number of ice cubes:

65 / 13 = 5

So, 5 ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees.

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes will make it 5 x 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Now, let's consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. Since any added liquid weakens the coffee, we need to add this to the weakening effect of the ice cubes:

60 + 15 = 75 milliliters

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple ratio. Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, the ratio of old records to new records is 2:1.

Let's say the number of old records brought in is x. Since 5 people come in and leave with 7 new records, the total number of new records is 7. 

Since the ratio of old records to new records is 2:1, the number of old records brought in is twice the number of new records. 

So, we can set up the equation: x = 2 * 7

Solving for x, we get x = 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of junior programmers. We are given that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 100. 

Number of junior programmers = (2/5) * 100 = 40

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, we can find the monthly salary of a senior programmer by adding $400 to the monthly salary of a junior programmer.

Monthly salary of a junior programmer = $2000
Monthly salary of a senior programmer = $2000 + $400 = $2400

Now, let's find the number of senior programmers. The total number of employees is 100, and the number of junior programmers is 40. So, the number of senior programmers is:

Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
= 100 - 40
= 60

Now, we can find the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers separately.

Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Monthly salary of a junior programmer
= 40 * $2000
= $80000

Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Monthly salary of a senior programmer
= 60 * $2400
= $144000

Now, we can find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month by adding the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers.

Total amount paid to all programmers = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
= $80000 + $144000
= $208000

The final answer is: $208000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as 'x'.

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus became x + 5.

At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the number of people on the bus became (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2.

Then, 8 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus became (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6.

We are given that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20, so we can set up the equation:

x + 6 = 20

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:

x = 20 - 6
x = 14

"To find out how many lollipops Oscar has, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Oscar has 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.

He passes 14 out to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.

He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

He eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to first find out how many percentage points are left to charge. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more to be fully charged.

Since the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can find the time it takes to charge 40% by multiplying the rate by the amount left to charge: 40% * 3 minutes/percentage-point = 120 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours.

"To determine which job pays more, we need to calculate the net pay for each job.

For Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per year: 2000
- Annual income: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- State tax rate: 20%
- Tax amount: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

For Job B:
- Annual income: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income before tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- State tax rate: 10%
- Tax amount: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net income: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Since $32,400 is greater than $24,000, Job B pays more.

To find the difference in net pay between the two jobs, we subtract the net income of Job A from the net income of Job B:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the price after the first year and then the price after the second year.

Initially, Maria buys 8 shares for $8 each, so the total cost is 8 * 8 = $64.

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price, we multiply the original price by 1.5 (100% + 50% = 150%, or 1 + 0.5 = 1.5).

New price after the first year = $8 * 1.5 = $12.

The stock price decreases by 25% in the second year. To find the new price, we multiply the price after the first year by 0.75 (100% - 25% = 75%, or 1 - 0.25 = 0.75).

New price after the second year = $12 * 0.75 = $9.

Now, we multiply the new price after the second year by the number of shares to find the final value of all Maria's shares.

Final value = $9 * 8 = $72.

"To find out how many hot dogs John ate, we first need to determine how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, Thomas ate 2 * 3 = 6 hot dogs.

Then, we need to find out how many hot dogs John ate. Since John ate half the amount Thomas ate, John ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

Now, we need to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke. To do this, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate: 3 - 2 = 1.

The final answer is: 1"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as x. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

Since the smallest group has x - 10 students, we can find the number of students in the smallest group by subtracting 10 from x:

x - 10 = 70 - 10
= 60

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's denote the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as Ch. We are given that Ch = 2C, and the total number of animals is 60, so we can write the equation:

C + Ch = 60

Substituting Ch = 2C into the equation, we get:

C + 2C = 60

Combine like terms:

3C = 60

Divide both sides by 3:

C = 20

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

Ch = 2C = 2(20) = 40

The total number of legs for the cows is 4C = 4(20) = 80, and the total number of legs for the chickens is 2Ch = 2(40) = 80.

The total number of legs for all animals is 80 + 80 = 160.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find out how many balls Josh is juggling with at the talent show, we need to determine how many balls he had before the incident and then subtract the balls that were lost.

Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. So, the total number of balls he has after 4 weeks is 3 + (1 * 4) = 7.

However, Josh drops 3 balls, but 2 are caught by the crowd. So, the total number of balls lost is 3 - 2 = 1.

Therefore, Josh starts juggling with 7 - 1 = 6 balls."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The green toad also weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
4. The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the animals and the container:

Total weight of animals = weight of pink frog + weight of blue beetle + weight of green toad + weight of yellow snake + weight of red bird
= 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30
= 240 pounds

Adding the weight of the container:
Total weight = Total weight of animals + weight of container
= 240 + 20
= 260 pounds

The final answer is: 260"
"To find the total number of outfits, we need to add the outfits Laurel received from her friend, the outfits she received at the baby shower, and the outfits her mom gifted her.

Laurel's friend gave her 24 outfits.
At the baby shower, she received twice the amount of new outfits, which is 2 * 24 = 48 outfits.
Her mom gifted her 15 outfits.

Now, let's add the total number of outfits: 24 + 48 + 15 = 87.

The final answer is: 87"
"To find the total distance Tyson covered in June, we first need to calculate the new daily distance he needs to run. 

The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day, which means we need to multiply the original distance by 1.2 (1 + 1/5). 

New daily distance = 5000 * 1.2 = 6000 meters.

Since there are 30 days in June, we can find the total distance covered in June by multiplying the new daily distance by 30.

Total distance in June = 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.

The final answer is: 180000"
"To find the price difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B, we first need to determine the price of each juice box.

Juice Box A is 4 dollars.
Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it is 4 + 5 = 9 dollars.
Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it is 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

Now, we need to find the difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B. 
The difference is 11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of table and then add them together.

The restaurant has 40 tables with 4 legs, so the total number of legs for these tables is:
40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs

The restaurant has 50 tables with 3 legs, so the total number of legs for these tables is:
50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs

Now, we add the total number of legs for both types of tables:
160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs

The total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310."
"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and her husband, and then subtract that from the total number of cookies in a bag.

Jenny's son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so he eats 4 * 5 = 20 cookies per week.

Jenny's husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats 1 * 7 = 7 cookies per week.

The total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies per week.

Since there are 36 cookies in a bag, and 27 are consumed by her son and husband, Jenny eats the remaining cookies. 

36 - 27 = 9

Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To find the total cost of the shirts, we first need to calculate the discount amount. 

The original price of each shirt is $30. 
The discount percentage is 40%. 
To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (as a decimal): 
$30 * 0.4 = $12 

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the discounted price of one shirt: 
$30 - $12 = $18 

Since Davos bought 2 shirts, we multiply the discounted price of one shirt by 2: 
$18 * 2 = $36 

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the percentage increase, we need to first find the difference in daily earnings and then divide it by the original daily earnings.

Original daily earnings = 10 tractors * $100 per tractor = $1000
New daily earnings = 5 silos * $220 per silo = $1100

Difference in daily earnings = New daily earnings - Original daily earnings = $1100 - $1000 = $100

Percentage increase = (Difference in daily earnings / Original daily earnings) * 100
= ($100 / $1000) * 100
= 10%

"To find out how much Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the total cost per month and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the cost of food per month. Since food costs $25 per week and there are 4 weeks in a month, the cost of food per month is:
$25/week * 4 weeks/month = $100/month

Now, let's add the cost of treats and medicine to the cost of food to get the total cost per month:
$100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total cost per year is:
$220/month * 12 months/year = $2640/year

"To find out how many plant pots April has left over, we need to calculate the total number of plant pots she needs and subtract that from the number she already bought.

First, let's calculate the number of plant pots needed for the roses. Since the school needs twice as many plant pots for the roses as for the daisies, and they need 30 plant pots for the daisies, they need 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots for the roses.

The total number of plant pots needed is 30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = 90 plant pots.

Since April already bought 100 plant pots, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number she bought: 100 - 90 = 10.

So, April has 10 plant pots left over.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent from the initial amount she had. 

First, let's calculate the total amount she spent: 
The sweater cost $11 and she gave her brother $4, so the total amount spent is $11 + $4 = $15.

Now, let's subtract the amount spent from the initial amount: 
$36 (initial amount) - $15 (amount spent) = $21.

So, Andrea saved $21. 

The final answer is: $21"
"To find the total time spent, we need to calculate the time spent boating, swimming, and watching shows. 

Time spent boating = 6 hours
Time spent swimming = 6 / 2 = 3 hours
Time spent watching shows = 3 * 2 = 6 hours

Total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows = 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours

Since this is 30% of the total time, we can set up the equation: 
0.3x = 15, where x is the total time spent.

To find x, we divide both sides by 0.3:
x = 15 / 0.3
x = 50

Now that we know the total time spent is 50 hours, we can find the time spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time:
Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * 50
Time spent sightseeing = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate how much money she has saved in total and subtract that from the cost of the phone.

First, let's calculate how much money Annabelle earned from her first job. She worked for 20 hours at $10 per hour, so she earned 20 * 10 = $200.

Next, let's calculate how much money Annabelle earned from her second job. She worked for 15 hours at $5 per hour, so she earned 15 * 5 = $75.

Now, let's add the money Annabelle already had in her savings to the money she earned from both jobs. She had $80, earned $200 from her first job, and earned $75 from her second job, so she has a total of 80 + 200 + 75 = $355.

Finally, let's subtract the total amount Annabelle has from the cost of the phone to find out how much more she needs to save. The phone costs $400, and Annabelle has $355, so she needs 400 - 355 = $45 more.

6 toy cars * $2 per toy car = $12

Next, let's calculate the total amount Dean spent on teddy bears: 
5 teddy bears * $1 per teddy bear = $5

Now, let's add the cost of the toy cars and teddy bears to find the total amount Dean spent: 
$12 (toy cars) + $5 (teddy bears) = $17

Dean initially had $28. After spending $17, he had: 
$28 - $17 = $11

His mother then gave him an extra $10, so we add that to the $11 he had: 
$11 + $10 = $21

"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost of the activities. 

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is 1 round * $5 = $5. 
Since there are 'x' friends, the total cost for mini-golf for all of them will be 1 round * $5 + 1 round * $5 = $10. 

The cost of arcade tokens for Morgan and her friends is 1 * $5 = $5. 

The cost of go-karts for Morgan and her friends is 2 rides * $10 = $20. 

The total cost for all activities is $10 (mini-golf) + $5 (arcade tokens) + $20 (go-karts) = $35.

Since Morgan has a budget of $90, we can subtract the total cost of the activities from her budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. $90 - $35 = $55.

Now, we need to find out how many friends she can invite with the remaining money. Since the cost of mini-golf for each friend is $5, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of mini-golf per person. $55 / $5 = 11.

However, this is the number of friends she can invite, but we also need to include Morgan herself. So, the total number of people (Morgan and her friends) is 11 + 1 = 12.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, let's find out how much change Billy has after buying the candy. Since he spent $1.5 per pound and he has $10, we can set up an equation to find the number of pounds of candy he bought. Let's call the number of pounds 'x'. The total cost of the candy is $1.5x. Since he has $10, the change he has is $10 - $1.5x.

2. After buying the candy, he takes half of his change and spends it on gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of the gumballs is 40 * $0.05 = $2. 

3. Since he took half of his change to buy the gumballs, the amount he spent on gumballs is half of his change. We can set up an equation to find his change: (10 - 1.5x) / 2 = 2.

4. Now, let's solve the equation for x. Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 10 - 1.5x = 4.

5. Subtract 10 from both sides: -1.5x = -6.

6. Divide both sides by -1.5: x = 4.

"Let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S. We are given that Carver is 45 years old, so C = 45.

We are also given that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, which can be expressed as:

C = 2S - 5

Substituting C = 45 into the equation, we get:

45 = 2S - 5

To solve for S, we add 5 to both sides of the equation:

45 + 5 = 2S
50 = 2S

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate S:

50 / 2 = S
25 = S

Therefore, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to add the distances between the three cities. 

Distance from the first city to the second city = 75 miles
Distance from the second city to the third city = 100 miles
Distance from the third city to the first city = 100 - 50 = 50 miles (since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs)

Total distance in one trip = 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day = 225 * 3 = 675 miles

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we need to divide the total distance it can travel before service by the distance it travels in a day.

Days between services = 18,000 / 675 = 26.67

So, the train goes approximately 26.67 days between services."
"To find the amount of stuffing needed for the collie beds, we first need to find the average amount of stuffing between the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds. 

The average amount of stuffing is calculated by adding the amount of stuffing for the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds and then dividing by 2. 

Average stuffing for collie beds = (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we need to find the total amount of stuffing needed for the chihuahua and collie beds. 

For 4 chihuahua beds, the total amount of stuffing needed is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

For 3 collie beds, the total amount of stuffing needed is 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

The total amount of stuffing needed is 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

"To find the total time taken for the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the trip and add them together.

First, let's calculate the time taken for the trip to his friend's house:
Distance = 200 miles
Speed = 70 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 200 / 70 = 2.857 hours (approximately)

However, he took a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. So, the actual distance traveled to his friend's house is 200 + 10 = 210 miles.
Time taken for the detour = 10 / 70 = 0.143 hours (approximately)
Total time taken to reach his friend's house = 2.857 + 0.143 = 3 hours

Now, let's calculate the time taken for the trip back home:
Distance = 240 miles
Speed = 80 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 240 / 80 = 3 hours

Total time taken for the trip = Time taken to reach his friend's house + Time taken to come back home
Total time taken = 3 + 3 = 6 hours

Total present students = Total fourth-graders - Total absent students
Total present students = 96 - 9
Total present students = 87

We know that 43 out of the total 96 fourth-graders are girls. So, the number of fourth-grade boys is:
Total fourth-graders - Total girls = 96 - 43 = 53

Now, we need to find the number of fourth-grade boys who were present on Friday. Since 4 boys were absent, the number of boys present is:

"To find the total cost of the picture frames, we first need to calculate the cost of etching the logo. The cost of etching is 20% of the cost of the picture frame, which is $20. 

20% of $20 is 0.2 x $20 = $4. 

So, the total cost of each picture frame with the logo etched is $20 + $4 = $24.

Since 44 seniors need to receive awards, and 2 of them will also receive pins, the total number of seniors receiving picture frames is 44 - 2 = 42.

The total cost of the picture frames is 42 x $24 = $1008.

The cost of the pins for 2 seniors is 2 x $5 = $10.

1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 1/4 x 44 = 11 officers.

The cost of the cords for the officers is 11 x $12 = $132.

"To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we need to calculate the number of apples picked each day and add them together.

On Monday, Lucy sold all the apples picked, and she got $56 from selling them at $4 per piece. So, the number of apples picked on Monday is $56 / $4 = 14.

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, let's add the number of apples picked each day: 14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many socks Lindsay has washed, we need to calculate the total number of socks she has washed. 

She washed 10 pairs of socks, and since each pair has 2 socks, she washed 10 * 2 = 20 socks from the pairs. 

She also washed 15 loose socks. 

So, the total number of socks she has washed is 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks that need washing, we subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total to find out how many she has missed: 50 - 35 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many cookies are left for Rachel, we need to add the number of cookies she initially bought to the number of cookies Janet gave her, and then subtract the number of cookies her brother ate.

First, let's add the number of cookies Rachel bought to the number of cookies Janet gave her:
23 (initial cookies) + 42 (cookies from Janet) = 65

Now, let's subtract the number of cookies her brother ate:
65 - 44 = 21

So, there are 21 cookies left for Rachel. 

21"
"To find the monthly payment, we can use the formula for monthly payments on a loan:

M = P [ i(1 + i)^n ] / [ (1 + i)^n - 1]

Where:
M = monthly payment
P = principal amount (initial loan amount) = $3,650
i = monthly interest rate = 10%/year / 12 months/year = 0.008333 (or 10%/12)
n = number of payments = 5 months

Plugging in the values, we get:

M = 3650 [ 0.008333(1 + 0.008333)^5 ] / [ (1 + 0.008333)^5 - 1]
M ≈ 3650 [ 0.008333(1.04319) ] / [ 1.04319 - 1]
M ≈ 3650 [ 0.008733 ] / 0.04319
M ≈ 3650 * 0.202
M ≈ 738.65

So, Karan has to pay approximately $738.65 per month. 

The final answer is: $738.65"
"To find out how many kilometers Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time. 

Cho's distance = 14 km/h * 8 h = 112 km

To find out how many kilometers Chloe hiked, we need to multiply her speed by the time she hiked.

Chloe's distance = 9 km/h * 5 h = 45 km

Now, we need to find the difference between Cho's distance and Chloe's distance to determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked.

Difference = Cho's distance - Chloe's distance
= 112 km - 45 km
= 67 km

The final answer is: 67"
"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the total number of silver pesos and gold pesos they have separately and then add them together.

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so Anna has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos.

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so Anna has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's add the total number of silver pesos and gold pesos they have together:
Total silver pesos = 50 (Axel's) + 100 (Anna's) = 150
Total gold pesos = 80 (Axel's) + 120 (Anna's) = 200

The total number of pesos they have together is the sum of the total silver pesos and total gold pesos:
Total pesos = Total silver pesos + Total gold pesos = 150 + 200 = 350

The final answer is: 350"
"To find the total profit per hour, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make with the supplies she bought. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she bought enough supplies to make 3 pitchers, she can make 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue will be the number of cups sold multiplied by the price per cup. Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, the total revenue per hour will be 4 * $1 = $4.

Now, let's find the total cost. Millie spent $18 to buy the supplies. Since she sells all of the lemonade, the total cost is $18.

The profit per hour is the total revenue per hour minus the total cost. So, the profit per hour is $4 - $18 is incorrect, we need to calculate the total number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade. 

To find the total number of hours, we need to divide the total number of cups by the number of cups sold per hour. The total number of cups is 36, and the number of cups sold per hour is 4. So, the total number of hours is 36 / 4 = 9 hours.

Now, we can find the total revenue by multiplying the number of hours by the revenue per hour. The total revenue is 9 * $4 = $36.

The profit per hour is the total revenue divided by the total number of hours. So, the profit per hour is $36 / 9 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we can use the concept of proportions. If he sold 3/5 of his land and had 12.8 hectares left, then the 2/5 of his land that he didn't sell is equal to 12.8 hectares.

Let's set up an equation to represent this:

(2/5) * x = 12.8

where x is the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2 to isolate x:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)

x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land initially.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the number of female members in the choir, we first need to calculate 50% of 52, which is the total number of members. 

50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26

Since there are 26 female members, and half of them can't make it to the show, we need to find half of 26.

Half of 26 = 26 / 2 = 13

Now, we have 13 female members who can make it to the show. The choir's 3 teachers will also be singing, so we need to add them to the number of female members.

Total number of people who sang in the performance = 13 + 3 = 16

The final answer is: 16"

First, we add up all the scores: 
65 + 94 = 159
159 + 81 = 240
240 + 86 = 326
326 + 74 = 400

Next, we divide the sum by the number of tests to find the average:
400 / 5 = 80

Wilson's current math grade is 80.

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu and add it to the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson.

First, let's find the number of messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Mr. Yu to the number of messages to Ms. Thompson to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

"To find out how much money David saves, we need to calculate the cost of the rides for Dasha and compare it to the cost of the ride bracelet for David.

Each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, so the cost of one ride is 2 * $2 = $4.

Dasha buys tickets for 9 rides, so the total cost for her is 9 * $4 = $36.

David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.

To find out how much Dasha would have spent if she bought a ride bracelet, we need to compare the cost of the bracelet to the cost of buying individual tickets. Since the bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides, and each ride costs $4, the cost of buying individual tickets for 9 rides is $36.

However, the question asks how much money David saves, not how much Dasha would have spent. Since David buys a ride bracelet for $30 and Dasha would have spent $36 on tickets, David saves $36 - $30 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to divide the total amount of ribbon by the total number of gifts. 

First, let's calculate the total number of gifts:

"To find the number of popsicles each person has, we can use the given ratio and the total number of popsicles. 

Let's assume the common multiplier for the ratio is x. Then, the number of popsicles Betty has is 5x and the number of popsicles Sam has is 6x. 

Since the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, we can set up the equation: 5x + 6x = 165.

Combine like terms: 11x = 165.

Divide both sides by 11: x = 15.

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of popsicles each person has. Betty has 5x = 5(15) = 75 popsicles, and Sam has 6x = 6(15) = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total cost of the streaming services, we need to calculate the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus. 

The normal cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, so together they cost $10 + $10 = $20. 

Since Tim saves 20% by bundling, we need to find 20% of $20. 
20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4.

So, the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (bundled Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

To find the amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his cable package, we subtract the total cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package: 
$60 (cable package) - $26 (streaming services) = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total time spent, we need to add up the time spent writing, recording, and editing the song. 

Time spent writing: 4 hours
Time spent recording: 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours
Time spent editing: 90 minutes = 1.5 hours

Total time spent = 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours

Now, to find the percentage of time spent editing, we need to divide the time spent editing by the total time and multiply by 100.

Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 / 7.5) * 100 = 20%

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of books Wendy needs to carry, we first need to determine the total number of books in the shelving system. Since it has 6 rows and 6 columns, we can find the total number of books by multiplying the number of rows by the number of columns.

Total number of books in the shelving system = 6 rows * 6 columns = 36 books

Now, Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in the shelving system. To find double the number of books, we multiply the total number of books by 2.

Double the number of books = 36 * 2 = 72

Then, we add 20 to this result to find the total number of books Wendy needs to carry.

Total number of books Wendy needs to carry = 72 + 20 = 92

The final answer is: 92"
"To find out how many Valentine's cards Erica has now, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, added to the cards her dad brought, and then subtract the cards she passed out and add the cards she received.

Initially, Erica made 20 Valentine's cards.

Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards that had 15 cards each, so she received 2 * 15 = 30 cards.

She initially had 20 cards, and her dad brought 30, so she had 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so she gave away 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

She had 50 cards and gave away 29, so she had 50 - 29 = 21 cards left.

She received 17 cards from family and friends, so she now has 21 + 17 = 38 cards.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find out how many slices are left, we first need to determine how many slices Jenny gave away. 

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, we can calculate the number of slices Bill received by multiplying 12 by 1/3. 

12 * (1/3) = 12 * 1 / 3 = 12 / 3 = 4 slices

Jenny gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. We can calculate the number of slices Mark received by multiplying 12 by 1/4.

12 * (1/4) = 12 * 1 / 4 = 12 / 4 = 3 slices

In total, Jenny gave away 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny ate 2 slices, so the total number of slices she gave away and ate is 7 + 2 = 9 slices.

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total number of slices given away and eaten from the total number of slices in the pizza.

12 - 9 = 3 slices

"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs first.

The number of millipedes is 1/3rd as many as the spiders, so it's 90 * (1/3) = 30 millipedes.

The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12, so it's 2 * 30 - 12 = 48 stink bugs.

Now, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs to find the total: 90 + 30 + 48 = 168.

The final answer is: 168"
"To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we first need to determine the ages of Alice and Beth.

Since Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years older than Erica, we can calculate Beth's age as follows:
Beth's age = Erica's age + 5
Beth's age = 30 + 5
Beth's age = 35

Now, we know that Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so we can calculate Alice's age as follows:
Alice's age = Beth's age + 7
Alice's age = 35 + 7
Alice's age = 42

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is:
Difference = Alice's age - Erica's age

"To find out how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for the quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, we multiply the ingredients by 4:

Flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
Milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark will need to buy:
12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark will need to buy:
4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4

"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the energy used per day before and after the reduction. 

Initially, the air conditioner uses 900 watts for 8 hours a day. To find the energy used in watt-hours (Wh), we multiply the power (watts) by the time (hours): 
900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 Wh per day.

Since 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) is equal to 1000 watt-hours (Wh), we can convert the energy used per day to kWh:
7200 Wh / 1000 = 7.2 kWh per day.

If Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours, the new usage time is 8 - 5 = 3 hours per day. 
The energy used per day after the reduction is:
900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh
2700 Wh / 1000 = 2.7 kWh per day.

The energy saved per day is the difference between the initial and final energy usage:
7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh per day.

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily energy saved by 30:
4.5 kWh/day * 30 days = 135 kWh.

"To find the average number of stripes, we need to calculate the total number of stripes and divide it by the total number of zebras.

First, let's find the total number of stripes on the two zebras with 17 stripes each: 2 * 17 = 34 stripes.

Next, we add the stripes of the zebra with 36 stripes: 34 + 36 = 70 stripes.

Then, we find the number of stripes on the zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes: 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Now, we add the stripes of the last zebra: 70 + 18 = 88 stripes.

The total number of zebras is 4 (2 with 17 stripes, 1 with 36 stripes, and 1 with 18 stripes).

To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the total number of zebras: 88 / 4 = 22.

"To find the total cost of the meat and cheese, we need to determine the total number of sandwiches required and the total cost of the ingredients.

First, we need to find the total number of sandwiches required. Since each sandwich serves 4 people and there are 20 people in total, we can divide 20 by 4 to get the total number of sandwiches required:

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we need a total of 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so the total cost of the meat is:

5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so the total cost of the cheese is:

5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is the sum of the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese:

$35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

The final answer is: $50.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, he has 2 * 40 = 80 corns.

He bought 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. So, he bought 60 cannolis and 60 - 40 = 20 corns.

Now, Allan has 40 (initial cannolis) + 60 (bought cannolis) = 100 cannolis and 80 (initial corns) + 20 (bought corns) = 100 corns.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 + 100 = 200.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first calculate the total steps he completed before the jog. 

Elliott finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since he wants to walk 10,000 steps, half of that would be 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.

He also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, the total steps completed before the jog would be 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Since he had 2,000 steps left to take after the jog, we can subtract the steps completed before the jog from the total steps he wants to take. This would be 10,000 - 6,000 = 4,000 steps.

However, this 4,000 steps is the remaining steps after the jog, not the steps taken during the jog. To find the steps taken during the jog, we need to subtract the remaining steps from the total steps he had after the school walks and the walk with his friend. 

So, the steps taken during the jog would be 6,000 + 2,000 = 8,000 steps.

60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

Toby will be 20 minutes early."
"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately and then add them together.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 * $2400 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees left is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in June is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought and subtract that from the initial $10.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means that for every 2 pounds of taffy, she pays $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound (since it's half off). So, the cost of 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. She bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks and the finale firework separately and then add them together.

The first package of fireworks costs $400. The second package costs twice that much, so it's 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the fireworks. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 0.20: $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

The discount amount is subtracted from the total cost: $1200 - $240 = $960.

The finale firework costs $150.

The total amount spent is the sum of the discounted fireworks and the finale firework: $960 + $150 = $1110.

"To find out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she will eat in 30 days and then divide that by the number of cookies her recipe makes.

Shannon eats 2 cookies per night, so in 30 days, she will eat 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she will eat by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs to make.

60 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5 dozens

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of a candle both smelling like wet dog and exploding. 

First, let's find the probability of a candle smelling like wet dog. This is given as 5% or 0.05. 

Next, we need to find the probability of a candle not exploding. Since the probability of a candle exploding is 1% or 0.01, the probability of a candle not exploding is 1 - 0.01 = 0.99.

However, we are given that 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, which means 1% of the candles will explode. This is consistent with the probability we calculated earlier (0.01).

Now, we need to find the probability of a candle both smelling like wet dog and not exploding. We can do this by multiplying the probability of a candle smelling like wet dog (0.05) by the probability of a candle not exploding (0.99). 

Probability of a candle smelling like wet dog and not exploding = 0.05 * 0.99 = 0.0495

Since we are given that 5% of the more dangerous candles (i.e., the ones that can explode) smell like wet dog, we can assume that the probability of a candle smelling like wet dog is conditional on it being one of the more dangerous candles. 

Let's denote the probability of a candle being more dangerous as x. Then, the probability of a candle smelling like wet dog given that it's more dangerous is 0.05. We can set up the equation:

0.05x = 0.05 (since 5% of the more dangerous candles smell like wet dog)

Solving for x, we get x = 1. This means that 100% of the candles that can explode are the more dangerous candles.

Now, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. We can do this by multiplying the probability of a candle smelling like wet dog and exploding (0.0495) by the total number of candles (50000).

Number of candles that smell like wet dog and explode = 0.0495 * 50000 = 2475

The final answer is: $\boxed{2475}$"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to find the discount amount. Since the blouses are 30% off, we can calculate the discount as 30% of the regular price of one blouse.

30% of $20 = 0.30 * $20 = $6

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, we need to multiply the discount amount by 4 to find the total discount.

Total discount = $6 * 4 = $24

Now, we need to find the price of the blouses after the discount. We can do this by subtracting the total discount from the total regular price of the blouses.

Total regular price = 4 * $20 = $80

Price after discount = Total regular price - Total discount
= $80 - $24
= $56

The final answer is: $56"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the tallest trees as T, from the average trees as A, and from the shortest trees as S. 

We know that Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees, so T = 30. 

We also know that Joanne gathered half this amount from the shortest trees, so S = 30 / 2 = 15.

We are given that Joanne's sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathered 2T apples from the tallest trees. Since the total number of apples gathered from the tallest trees is T + 2T = 3T, we can set up the equation 3T = 30 + 2T (since Joanne's sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees). Solving for T, we get T = 30.

However, we already know that T = 30, so this equation is consistent.

We are also given that Joanne's sister gathered 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so her sister gathered 3S apples from the shortest trees. Since the total number of apples gathered from the shortest trees is S + 3S = 4S, we can set up the equation 4S = 15 + 3S (since Joanne gathered 15 apples from the shortest trees). Solving for S, we get S = 15.

However, we already know that S = 15, so this equation is consistent.

We are given that the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples. We can set up the equation T + A + S + 2T + 3S = 500 (since Joanne's sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees). Substituting T = 30 and S = 15, we get 30 + A + 15 + 2(30) + 3(15) = 500.

Simplifying the equation, we get 30 + A + 15 + 60 + 45 = 500.

Combine like terms, we get 150 + A = 500.

Subtract 150 from both sides, we get A = 350.

The final answer is: 350"
"Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. We are given two pieces of information:

1. The total number of heads is 180, which means C + D = 180.
2. The total number of bumps is 304, which means 2C + D = 304 (since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump).

We can solve this system of linear equations by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can find the number of dromedaries by substituting C into the first equation:

D = 180 - C
D = 180 - 124
D = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd.

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to calculate the distance traveled in each segment of the trip and add them up.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

In the next 2 days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 km is:
(30/100) * 800 km = 240 km
So, the total distance traveled in the next 2 days is 240 km.

In the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance traveled is 0 km.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, let's add up the distances traveled in each segment:
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The final answer is: 3140"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work backwards from Peter's locker size. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can find Zack's locker size by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4.

Zack's locker size = 5 cubic inches * 4 = 20 cubic inches

Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can find Timothy's locker size by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size = 20 cubic inches * 2 = 40 cubic inches

"To find the elevation where Stanley's comb fell, we need to subtract the elevation of the ledge from the initial elevation of Stanley. 

Stanley's initial elevation: 10,000 feet
Elevation of the ledge: 4,000 feet
Elevation of Stanley's comb: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation of Stanley's comb and Oliver's elevation.

Elevation of Stanley's comb: 6,000 feet
Oliver's elevation: 3,000 feet
Distance Oliver must climb: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

"To find the total amount of money Mr. Josue has now, we need to calculate the amount of money he received from the second bank and add it to the initial capital and the money from the first bank.

The first bank gave him $4000. 
The second bank gave him twice as much, so the second bank gave him 2 * $4000 = $8000.

Now, let's add the money from both banks to the initial capital: 
$4000 (from the first bank) + $8000 (from the second bank) = $12000
$12000 + $5000 (initial capital) = $17000

The final answer is: $17000"
"To find the number of cats left on the rock, we need to follow the steps:

Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.

Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats taken away is 4 x 5 = 20.

Now, the number of cats left on the rock is 50 - 20 = 30.

Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5, which is (30 * 3)/5 = 90/5 = 18.

So, the number of cats that ran after the mouse is 18.

Now, the number of cats left on the rock is 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different pricing periods.

1. The first 6 months were $8 a month, so the cost for this period is 6 * $8 = $48.
2. The next 8 months were $12 a month, so the cost for this period is 8 * $12 = $96.
3. The remaining months in 2 years (24 months) minus the first 14 months (6 + 8) is 24 - 14 = 10 months. The cost for this period is 10 * $14 = $140.

Now, we add up the costs for each period: $48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284.

The final answer is: $284"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let the cost of the jogger jeans be x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, we can write an equation:

x = 28 - 6
x = 22

So, the jogger jeans cost $22.

The total savings is $6, and Cole saved 1/3 of this amount from the jogger jeans. Let's find the amount saved from the jogger jeans:

1/3 of the total savings = 1/3 * 6 = 2

The amount saved from the jogger jeans is $2.

Since the total savings is $6, the amount saved from the tattered jeans is:

6 - 2 = 4

The cost of the tattered jeans is $28, and the amount saved from them is $4. To find the original price of the tattered jeans, we subtract the savings from the cost:

Original price of tattered jeans = 28 + 4 = 32

Now, we need to find how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:

Difference in cost = Cost of jogger jeans - Cost of tattered jeans
= 22 - 32
= -10

However, the question asks for how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, which implies a positive difference. Since the jogger jeans are cheaper, we can take the absolute value of the difference:

Difference in cost = | -10 | = 10

The capacity of the 6 minibusses is 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
The capacity of the 10 minivans is 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, we add the capacities together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of birds that visit the bird feeders each day. 

First, let's find the number of birds that visit the store-bought bird feeders. Since there are 3 store-bought bird feeders and each attracts 20 birds, the total number of birds visiting the store-bought bird feeders is 3 * 20 = 60.

Next, let's find the number of birds that visit the bird feeders made by Lillian. Since each of these bird feeders attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, each of Lillian's bird feeders attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds. Since there are 3 bird feeders made by Lillian, the total number of birds visiting these bird feeders is 3 * 30 = 90.

Now, we add the number of birds visiting the store-bought bird feeders and the number of birds visiting Lillian's bird feeders to find the total number of birds that visit the garden each day. 60 + 90 = 150.

"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The bagel costs $4. 
The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find 25% of $4, we multiply $4 by 0.25: $4 * 0.25 = $1. Then, we add this to the cost of the bagel: $4 + $1 = $5. So, the soup costs $5.

The cake costs half the price of the bagel. To find half of $4, we divide $4 by 2: $4 / 2 = $2. So, the cake costs $2.

Now, we add the costs of the bagel, soup, and cake together: $4 + $5 + $2 = $11.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as 'x'. Since he keeps 1/3 of the cards, he sells 2/3 of them. 

The total amount of money he gets from selling the cards is $1.5 * (2/3)x. He also has $50 in spending cash, so the total amount of money he has is $1.5 * (2/3)x + $50. This amount should be equal to the cost of the ticket, which is $100.

Now, let's set up the equation:

$1.5 * (2/3)x + $50 = $100

First, let's simplify the equation by multiplying 1.5 and 2/3:

$1 * (1)x + $50 = $100

Now, let's simplify further by multiplying 1 and x:

x + $50 = $100

Now, let's subtract $50 from both sides of the equation:

x = $50

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, the caterer prepared enough hot dogs for half of the guests to have two hot dogs. Since there are 36 guests, half of them would be 36 / 2 = 18 guests. 

For these 18 guests, the caterer prepared 2 hot dogs each, so the total number of hot dogs prepared for these 18 guests is 18 * 2 = 36 hot dogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog. This means that the caterer had to provide an additional 40 - 36 = 4 hot dogs for the extra 4 guests.

Since the caterer had already prepared 36 hot dogs for the initial 18 guests, and now needs to provide 4 more hot dogs for the extra 4 guests, the total number of hot dogs prepared is 36 + 4 = 40 hot dogs.

Now, we need to find out how many guests did not get a second hot dog. Since the caterer had prepared enough hot dogs for 18 guests to have two hot dogs, and there are 40 guests in total, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is 40 - 18 = 22.

However, this is not the correct answer. The question asks how many guests did not get a second hot dog, but it does not specify that they did not get any hot dogs. The correct interpretation is that the 18 guests who were initially prepared for had two hot dogs, and the remaining guests got one hot dog each. So, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is 40 - 18 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we need to first find half of the number of letters in Indras' name. 

Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3. 

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

The total number of letters in both names is 6 (Indras) + 7 (sister) = 13.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the 20% discount.

The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00.
The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00.
The cost of the 5 separate utensils is 5 x $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost of the items before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

To apply the 20% discount, we need to find 20% of $165.00, which is 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00.

The discount amount is $33.00, so we subtract this from the total cost: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

The final cost of Charlotte's order is $132.00.

$132.00"
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and subtract the amount of money she already has.

The total cost of the items is: $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19

Dora has a total of $2 (her allowance) + $16 (from her mother) = $18

To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 (total cost) - $18 (amount she has) = $1

The final answer is: $1"
"To find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to first determine how many dragons Prince Arthur and Prince Walter slew, and then calculate one-fifth of that number.

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons. 
Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, so Prince Arthur slew 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so Prince Walter slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so Prince Bruce slew 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to determine how much gas was in one container. 

15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, so each container has 15 / 5 = 3 gallons.

Since Josey needed 1/4 of a container, we need to find 1/4 of 3 gallons. 

1/4 of 3 gallons is 3 * (1/4) = 0.75 gallons.

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we need to convert 0.75 gallons to pints. 

0.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George had initially. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can set up an equation to represent this situation.

Let's denote the initial amount of money George had as 'x'. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can write the equation as:

x - 5 = 0.01x

To solve for x, we can add 5 to both sides of the equation:

x = 0.01x + 5

Subtract 0.01x from both sides:

0.99x = 5

Now, divide both sides by 0.99:

x = 5 / 0.99
x = 5.05

So, George initially had $5.05.

Now, let's find out how much he spent on chips. He bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so the total amount spent on chips is:

3 * 0.40 = $1.20

Since he spent $5 in total, the amount spent on candy bars is:

5 - 1.20 = $3.80

Now, we know that each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars he bought is:

3.80 / 0.75 = 5.07

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can see that 5 candy bars would cost 3.75, and 6 candy bars would cost 4.50, so the only way to get a total of 3.80 is to buy 5 candy bars and 20 cents worth of chips. However, we know that he bought 3 bags of chips, so he must have bought 5 candy bars and 20 cents worth of chips is not possible, so he must have bought 5 candy bars and 20 cents is the remainder of

"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to first determine how many lollipops he shared with his friends. 

Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself, so the number of lollipops he shared is 25 - 5 = 20.

Since he shared the lollipops equally among his 4 friends, we need to divide the number of lollipops shared by the number of friends: 20 / 4 = 5.

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the remaining weight of the cake, we first need to find out how much the two pieces that Rory and her mom had weigh. 

Each piece is 1/8 of the total weight of the cake, which is 20 ounces. 

So, the weight of one piece is 20 / 8 = 2.5 ounces. 

Since Rory and her mom each have a piece, the total weight of their pieces is 2.5 * 2 = 5 ounces.

Now, we subtract the weight of their pieces from the total weight of the cake to find the remaining weight. 

Remaining weight = Total weight - Weight of Rory and her mom's pieces
= 20 - 5
= 15 ounces

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many oranges each person will get, we need to first calculate the total number of oranges they have together. 

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. 

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56

They are sharing the oranges with 6 other friends, so the total number of people sharing the oranges is 8 (Sitti, Juris, and 6 friends).

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people.

Oranges per person = Total oranges / Total people
= 56 / 8
= 7

So, everyone will get 7 oranges. 

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the cost per serving, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and divide it by the number of servings.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the onions. Antoine wants to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of onions is $2.00 per pound, so the total cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the beef stock. Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is the sum of the cost of onions and beef stock, which is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Since the soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is the total cost divided by the number of servings, which is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater and then calculate how much earlier she needs to leave than Wayne.

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, we can calculate Bernadette's drive time as follows:

Bernadette's drive time = 4 * Wayne's drive time
= 4 * 4 minutes
= 16 minutes

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, we need to calculate how much earlier she needs to leave than Wayne. 

Let x be the time Wayne leaves. Then Bernadette needs to leave x - 5 minutes before Wayne. 

The time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater is 16 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

x - 5 + 16 = x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 11 = x

Subtracting x from both sides, we get:

11 = 0

This equation doesn't make sense, so let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater. So, she needs to leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne.

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to leave 21 minutes before Wayne to arrive 5 minutes before him.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to find the width of the room. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. 

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length in feet is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length * width = area. We can rearrange this formula to solve for the width: width = area / length. 

Plugging in the values we know, we get width = 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet.

Now that we have the width, we can find the perimeter of the room using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is 2 * (length + width). 

Plugging in the values we know, we get perimeter = 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet) = 2 * 49 feet = 98 feet.

The final answer is: 98"
"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister has.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, let's find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
Margareth's beads - Elizabeth's beads = 140 - 60 = 80

"To find the final temperature of the house, we need to calculate the temperature increase due to the oven and the temperature decrease due to the open window.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven:

The oven is on for 3 hours, and it raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, the total temperature increase is:
3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

Now, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the open window:

The window is open for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes, so for 30 minutes, it cools down:
(30 minutes / 10 minutes) * 2 degrees = 6 degrees

Now, let's calculate the final temperature of the house:
Initial temperature = 40 degrees
Temperature increase due to oven = 15 degrees
Temperature decrease due to window = 6 degrees
Final temperature = Initial temperature + Temperature increase - Temperature decrease
= 40 + 15 - 6
= 49 degrees

The final answer is: 49"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took James to complete each segment of the triathlon. 

Let's start with the swim. Since James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, and Jon took 40 minutes, we can calculate James' swim time as follows:

James' swim time = Jon's swim time - (10% of Jon's swim time)
= 40 - (0.1 * 40)
= 40 - 4
= 36 minutes

Next, we know that James took 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. Since Jon took 1 hour and 20 minutes (or 80 minutes) for the bike ride, we can calculate James' bike time as follows:

James' bike time = Jon's bike time + 5 minutes
= 80 + 5
= 85 minutes

Now, we know that Jon won by 10 minutes, which means that the difference between James' total time and Jon's total time is 10 minutes. We can set up an equation to represent this:

Jon's total time - James' total time = 10 minutes

We know Jon's total time is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes. We also know James' swim time (36 minutes) and bike time (85 minutes). Let's call James' run time 'x'. Then, we can set up the equation as follows:

170 - (36 + 85 + x) = 10

Simplifying the equation, we get:

170 - 121 - x = 10
49 - x = 10
x = 39

So, it took James 39 minutes to complete the run. 

The final answer is: 39"
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then divide it by 4.

Movie C is 1.25 hours. We need to convert this to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, which is 75 minutes. So, Movie B is:

75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, which is 80 minutes. To find the length of Movie A, we divide 80 by 4:

80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

First, let's find out how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes. Since the horse runs at 32MPH, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

30 minutes is equal to 0.5 hours (since 1 hour = 60 minutes).

Now, we can calculate the distance the horse runs in 0.5 hours:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32MPH * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, the total amount of hay the horse eats in 16 miles is:
Total hay = 16 miles * 1/2 bail/mile
Total hay = 8 bails

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of the hay is:
Total cost = 8 bails * $3/bail
Total cost = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:
Total money = 6 * $5
Total money = $30

Now, we can find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay:
Change = Total money - Total cost
Change = $30 - $24
Change = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total, we need to calculate the number of eggs in the cases and add the loose eggs. 

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, 4 dozen eggs would be 4 x 12 = 48 eggs. 

Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs, so the total number of glasses Rozanne can make is 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, the number of trays Rozanne can put out is 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from the sale of the sneakers and subtract the initial cost.

First, let's find the revenue from the flash sale on Monday: 
17 sneakers were sold for $20 each, so the revenue from the flash sale is 17 x $20 = $340.

Next, let's find the revenue from the sale to the department store:
The salesman had 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left.
He sold them for $25 each, so the revenue from the department store sale is 31 x $25 = $775.

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the department store sale: $340 + $775 = $1115.

The initial cost of the sneakers was $576. To find the profit, we subtract the initial cost from the total revenue: $1115 - $576 = $539.

The final answer is: $539"

6 packets * 8 crayons/packet = 48 crayons

Next, let's calculate the total number of crayons in the four packets with 16 pieces each:
4 packets * 16 crayons/packet = 64 crayons

Now, let's add the total number of crayons from both types of packets:
48 crayons + 64 crayons = 112 crayons

The final answer is: 112"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The super ticket costs $20 and includes a soda and popcorn for $1 extra.
2. The regular price of a soda is $3.
3. If you buy a regular ticket and don't get the super ticket, you save $2.

Since you save $2 by not getting the super ticket, the extra $1 for popcorn and soda in the super ticket must be equal to the cost of the soda ($3) minus the savings ($2), which is $1.

However, we know that the extra $1 is for both the popcorn and the soda. Since the soda costs $3, the cost of the popcorn can be found by subtracting the cost of the soda from the extra $1.

Let's denote the cost of the popcorn as P. Then, the equation becomes:
1 = 3 - P

To find the cost of the popcorn (P), we can rearrange the equation:
P = 3 - 1
P = 2

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as x. Since the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, we can set up the equation:

20x = 900

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

x = 900 / 20
x = 45

So, the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, so the new cost of filling one balloon is:

New cost = Original cost + Increase
New cost = 45 + 20
New cost = 65

Now, we need to find the total cost of filling 170 balloons at the new cost. 

Total cost = New cost * Number of balloons
Total cost = 65 * 170
Total cost = 11050

The final answer is: $11050"
"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 mph x 2 hours = 120 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour:
Distance = Speed x Time = 30 mph x 1 hour = 30 miles

Now, let's find the total distance traveled:
Total Distance = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

The total time taken is the sum of the time taken at each speed:
Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Finally, we can calculate the average speed:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph

"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she received.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires and trades 3 for 2 rubies. So, she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

The value of the sapphires she has left is 5 * $800 = $4000.

The value of the 2 rubies she received is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"
"To find the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of apples they eat per day and then multiply it by 30.

Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day, so together they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples per day.

Now, we multiply the total number of apples they eat per day by 30:

8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds.

The volume of one raised bed is calculated as length * width * height. 
Volume = 2 feet * 8 feet * 2 feet = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:
Total Volume = 32 cubic feet/bed * 10 beds = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. To find the number of bags needed, we divide the total volume by the volume of one bag:
Number of bags = Total Volume / Volume per bag = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:
Total Cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag = 160 bags * $12/bag = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of cards, we first need to determine the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of red cards = 15
Increase in green cards = 60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards = 15 + 24 = 39

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78

The final answer is: 78"
"To find the number of fairies remaining, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies.

After 20 minutes, one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. This means her friend saw 50 / 2 = 25 fairies. So, the total number of fairies now is 50 + 25 = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. To find the remaining number of fairies, we subtract 30 from 75: 75 - 30 = 45.

The final number of fairies remaining is 45."
"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add the number of puppies Jennifer's dog has to the number of puppies Brandon's dog has. 

Total puppies = 8 (Jennifer's dog) + 12 (Brandon's dog) = 20

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. 

Puppies with spots = 3 (Jennifer's dog) + 4 (Brandon's dog) = 7

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

The final answer is: 35"
"To find the total number of trips the farmer needs to make, we need to calculate the total weight of all the feed and divide it by the capacity of the farm truck.

First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up the total weight of all the feed:
2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips:
3400 / 2250 = 1.511 (round up to the nearest whole number since we can't make a fraction of a trip)

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the total earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately and then add them together.

Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week, so in a month (4 weeks), she drinks 3 * 4 = 12 aluminum cans. Since each aluminum can is worth 2 cents, her earnings from aluminum cans in a month are 12 * 2 = 24 cents.

Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week, so in a month (4 weeks), she drinks 5 * 4 = 20 plastic bottles. Since each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents, her earnings from plastic bottles in a month are 20 * 3 = 60 cents.

Now, let's add the earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles: 24 cents + 60 cents = 84 cents.

"To find the number of plants Shondra has, we need to first find the number of plants Toni has. 

Since Frederick has 10 plants and Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has by finding 60% of 10 and adding it to 10.

60% of 10 = 0.6 * 10 = 6

Toni has 10 + 6 = 16 plants.

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we can find the number of plants Shondra has by subtracting 7 from the number of plants Toni has.

Shondra has 16 - 7 = 9 plants.

"To find out how many students Miss Maria has, we first need to calculate the total number of cards she has. 

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, so the total number of basketball cards is 6 * 25 = 150.

She has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200.

The total number of cards is the sum of basketball and baseball cards, which is 150 + 200 = 350.

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the remaining cards are 350 - 50 = 300.

If her students got 10 cards each, the number of students is the total remaining cards divided by the number of cards each student got, which is 300 / 10 = 30.

"To find out how much Kelly paid, we need to calculate the cost of the apples for both Becky and Kelly.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each. She received a $1 discount. 

First, we need to find the total cost of the apples for Becky before the discount. 
Total cost for Becky = 20 * 45 cents = 20 * 0.45 = $9

Since Becky received a $1 discount, we subtract the discount from the total cost.
Cost for Becky = Total cost for Becky - Discount = $9 - $1 = $8

Now, let's calculate the cost of the apples for Kelly. Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each and received a 10% discount.

First, we need to find the total cost of the apples for Kelly before the discount.
Total cost for Kelly = 20 * 50 cents = 20 * 0.50 = $10

Now, we need to find 10% of the total cost for Kelly to calculate the discount.
Discount for Kelly = 10% of $10 = 0.10 * $10 = $1

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the cost for Kelly.
Cost for Kelly = Total cost for Kelly - Discount for Kelly = $10 - $1 = $9

Now, we can find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky by subtracting the cost for Becky from the cost for Kelly.
Difference = Cost for Kelly - Cost for Becky = $9 - $8 = $1

"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be represented as:

Number of cookies = (1/2)x + 2

Since Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable. First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion from set theory. 

Let's denote the set of kids allergic to dairy as D, the set of kids allergic to peanuts as P, and the set of kids allergic to both as B. We know that |D| = 9, |P| = 6, and |B| = 3.

The principle of inclusion-exclusion states that the total number of kids allergic to at least one of the two substances is given by:

|D ∪ P| = |D| + |P| - |B|

Substituting the given values, we get:

|D ∪ P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12

This is the number of kids allergic to at least one of the two substances. To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we subtract this from the total number of kids in the class:

Total kids = 32
Kids allergic to at least one substance = 12
Kids not allergic to anything = Total kids - Kids allergic to at least one substance

Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint. Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, so Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint. Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so Jasper has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

To find the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we add the number of blue and yellow tubes: 2 (blue) + 9 (yellow) = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to find the weight of the 2010 penny. 

Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can set up an equation to find its weight. Let's denote the weight of the 2010 penny as x. 

The equation is: x = (3/4) * 48

To solve for x, we multiply 48 by 3 and then divide by 4. 

x = (3 * 48) / 4
x = 144 / 4
x = 36

So, the 2010 penny weighs 36 grains.

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding the weights of the 1959 penny and the 2010 penny.

Combined weight = 48 + 36
Combined weight = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how much more they need to earn, we need to subtract the total amount they have already earned from their goal. 

First, let's add the amount Keegan and Tasha have earned so far: 
$83 (Keegan) + $91 (Tasha) = $174

Now, let's subtract the total amount they have earned from their goal: 
$200 (goal) - $174 (total earned) = $26

They need to earn $26 more to reach their goal.

The final answer is: $26"
"To find out how many songs Luri can add to his player, we need to first determine how many songs he currently has. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, Luri has 3 * 20 = 60 songs.

Now, we need to find out how many songs each can add to their player. Since each player can store up to 100 songs, Gabriel can add 100 - 20 = 80 songs, and Luri can add 100 - 60 = 40 songs.

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add than Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add: 80 - 40 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to first find out how many oranges he ate. 

They picked 60 oranges and Stetson ate 2/5 of them. 

2/5 of 60 can be calculated as (2/5) * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24.

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. 

Since Stetson gave up $10 for each orange he ate, the total amount of money he gave up is 24 * 10 = 240.

The final answer is: $240"
"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we need to first calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes. 

Cost of shoes = $80
3 times the cost of shoes = 3 * $80 = $240

Since the handbag cost $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes, we subtract $20 from $240.

Cost of handbag = 3 times the cost of shoes - $20
= $240 - $20
= $220

The final answer is: $220"
"To find out how many hours James runs a week, we need to first calculate the total miles he runs in a week. 

James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week, so the total miles he runs in a week is 12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week.

Since James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour, we can find the total hours he runs in a week by dividing the total miles by his speed. 

Total hours = Total miles / Speed
Total hours = 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour
Total hours = 6 hours/week

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in a day. 

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and he feeds them twice a day. So, each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has four horses, the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in a day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

For five days, the total amount of oats consumed is 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats, so to find out how many bags Uncle Ben needs, we divide the total amount of oats consumed by the amount in each bag: 200 / 50 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the number of girl Pomeranians, we first need to find the total number of Pomeranians. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can calculate this as follows:

Total puppies = 27
Pomeranians = (2/3) * Total puppies
Pomeranians = (2/3) * 27
Pomeranians = 18

Now, we need to find the number of girl Pomeranians. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can calculate this as follows:

Girl Pomeranians = (1/3) * Pomeranians
Girl Pomeranians = (1/3) * 18
Girl Pomeranians = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the average highest temperature, we need to add the temperatures of the three countries and divide by 3.

First, let's add the temperatures:
-48 (Southlandia) + 21 (Northlandia) + (-3) (Midlandia) = -30

Now, let's divide the sum by 3:
-30 / 3 = -10

The average highest temperature of the three countries is -10 degrees Fahrenheit."
"To find out how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we need to first calculate the remaining amount he needs to save. 

The toy car costs $12, and he already has $4 savings. So, the remaining amount he needs to save is $12 - $4 = $8.

He promises to save $2 daily from his allowance. To find out how many days it will take him to save the remaining amount, we can divide the remaining amount by the daily savings.

$8 (remaining amount) ÷ $2 (daily savings) = 4 days

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we need to calculate the total capacity of the trays and subtract the number of eggs he has.

Each tray can hold 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays, so the total capacity is 24 * 2 = 48 eggs.

Jaime has 64 eggs, but the trays can only hold 48 eggs. To find out how many eggs won't fit, we subtract the capacity from the number of eggs: 64 - 48 = 16.

So, Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the tray.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total amount Sally spent, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza first. Since it costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, we multiply the cost of the small pizza by 3.

Cost of small pizza: $8
Cost of family-size pizza: $8 * 3 = $24

Now, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount spent.

Total amount spent: $8 + $24 = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"To find the cost of each individual razor after the discount, we need to first calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the buy one get one free offer and then apply the $2.00 coupon.

Since the razors are buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. 

Now, let's calculate the cost of 2 packs with the buy one get one free offer: 
Cost of 2 packs = Cost of 1 pack = $4.00

Now, let's apply the $2.00 coupon to the cost of 2 packs:
Total cost after coupon = Cost of 2 packs - Coupon = $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00

Since each pack contains 4 razors, the total number of razors in 2 packs is 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

Now, let's find the cost of each individual razor:
Cost per razor = Total cost after coupon / Total number of razors = $2.00 / 8 = $0.25

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100:
Cost per razor in cents = $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents

"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each level and add them up.

The 4 girls on the bottom are 64"" tall, so their total height is 4 * 64 = 256"".

The 3 girls on top of the 4 are also 64"" tall, so their total height is 3 * 64 = 192"".

The 2 girls on top of the 3 are also 64"" tall, so their total height is 2 * 64 = 128"".

The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, we add up the heights of all the levels: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 636"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 636"" / 12 = 53 feet.

The final answer is: 53"
"To find the total number of minutes Charisma walked, we need to calculate the total number of 5-minute breaks she took in a day and then multiply it by the number of days she worked.

Charisma works 8 hours a day, and she takes a 5-minute break every hour. So, the total number of 5-minute breaks in a day is 8 hours * 1 break per hour = 8 breaks per day.

Since each break is 5 minutes long, the total number of minutes she walked in a day is 8 breaks * 5 minutes per break = 40 minutes per day.

Charisma worked for 5 days, so the total number of minutes she walked is 40 minutes per day * 5 days = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Angela's current age be x.

In four years, Angela's age will be x + 4.

According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is 14 years old now, we can set up the equation:

x + 4 = 3(14)

To solve for x, we need to multiply 3 by 14:

x + 4 = 42

Now, we need to isolate x by subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation:

x = 42 - 4
x = 38

So, Angela is currently 38 years old.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides separately, and then add them together.

The cost of the morning rides is the cost per ride multiplied by the number of days: $6 * 14 = $84.

The cost of the afternoon rides is the cost per ride multiplied by the number of days: $2 * 14 = $28.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides: $84 + $28 = $112.

"To find out how many Greek orange pies Brianne and Ashley can make, we need to calculate the total number of oranges they have and then divide that by the number of oranges needed for one pie.

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so she has 5 x 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

In total, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, they can make 120 / 3 = 40 pies.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

For the first venue, the total cost is the flat fee of $200 plus the cost of food for each guest, which is $5x. So, the total cost for the first venue is 200 + 5x.

For the second venue, the total cost is the cost per guest, which is $25x, since food is already included.

To find the number of guests for which the two venues are equal in cost, we set the two expressions equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtracting 5x from both sides gives us:

200 = 20x

Dividing both sides by 20 gives us:

10 = x

"Let's denote the number of insects found by Lily as L, David as D, and Bodhi as B. 

We are given that L + D + B = 43. 

We also know that L = D + 7. 

We also know that D = B/2.

We can substitute the value of D from the second equation into the first equation: L + (B/2) + B = 43.

We can simplify this to L + 1.5B = 43.

Now, we can substitute the value of L from the second equation into the previous equation: (D + 7) + 1.5B = 43.

We can substitute the value of D from the third equation into the previous equation: ((B/2) + 7) + 1.5B = 43.

We can simplify this to (B/2) + 1.5B + 7 = 43.

We can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: B + 3B + 14 = 86.

We can combine like terms: 4B + 14 = 86.

We can subtract 14 from both sides: 4B = 72.

We can divide both sides by 4: B = 18.

Now that we know B, we can find D: D = B/2 = 18/2 = 9.

Now that we know D, we can find L: L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16.

"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to calculate the yards used by Mariah and her grandma separately and then add them together.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein. To find 1/4 of 364, we multiply 364 by 1/4 (which is the same as dividing by 4).

364 / 4 = 91 yards

So, Mariah used 91 yards of yarn.

Mariah's grandma used 1/2 of a skein, which is the same as 2/4. To find 2/4 of 364, we multiply 364 by 2 and then divide by 4.

364 * 2 = 728
728 / 4 = 182 yards

So, Mariah's grandma used 182 yards of yarn.

Now, we add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma together:

91 + 182 = 273 yards

The final answer is: 273"
"To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the number of gifts for her friends and add the 10 random gifts.

First, let's calculate the number of gifts for her friends. 2 friends want 5 gifts each, so the total number of gifts for these friends is 2 x 5 = 10. The other 3 friends want 2 gifts each, so the total number of gifts for these friends is 3 x 2 = 6. 

Now, we add the number of gifts for the first 2 friends (10) and the number of gifts for the other 3 friends (6), which gives us 10 + 6 = 16. 

Finally, we add the 10 random gifts to the total number of gifts for her friends, which gives us 16 + 10 = 26.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as 'x'. Since Suzie bought two packs of strawberry gum, the total cost for these packs is 2x.

She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum. 

She also paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum, which means the cost of the green apple gum is $2 / 2 = $1.

The total cost of all four packs of gum is $7. We can set up an equation to represent this:

2x + 2 + 1 = 7

Combine the constants on the left side of the equation:

2x + 3 = 7

Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the variable:

2x = 4

Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x:

x = 2

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine which type of wood Frederick should buy to maximize the number of popsicle sticks he can make while staying within his budget of $24.

Let's analyze the options:

- A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and yields 200 sticks.
- A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and yields 400 sticks.

Since Frederick wants to buy the cheapest lumber, he should buy the 2 x 4 piece of wood. However, we need to check if buying multiple 2 x 4 pieces would be more cost-effective.

Let's calculate the cost per stick for each option:

- For a 2 x 4 piece of wood: $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick
- For a 2 x 8 piece of wood: $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick

Since the 2 x 8 piece of wood yields more sticks per dollar, Frederick should buy the 2 x 8 piece of wood. However, we need to check if buying multiple 2 x 4 pieces would be more cost-effective.

Let's calculate the maximum number of 2 x 4 pieces Frederick can buy with his budget:

$24 / $4 = 6

If Frederick buys 6 2 x 4 pieces, he will get:

6 x 200 sticks = 1200 sticks

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 2 x 8 pieces:

$24 / $6 = 4

If Frederick buys 4 2 x 8 pieces, he will get:

4 x 400 sticks = 1600 sticks

Since 1600 sticks is more than 1200 sticks, Frederick should buy 4 2 x 8 pieces of wood.

The final answer is: 1600"
"To find the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs, we need to first determine the total number of snowshoes required. Since each dog has 4 legs and Mario has 6 dogs, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24.

Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, the total number of snowshoes required is also 24. However, since snowshoes come in pairs, we need to divide the total number of snowshoes by 2 to get the number of pairs. 

24 / 2 = 12 pairs of snowshoes.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of pairs by the cost per pair. 

12 * $12.00 = $144.00

The final answer is: $144.00"
"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week and then subtract the cost of the weekly pass.

Janet takes two bus trips per day, five days a week. So, the total number of bus trips per week is 2 * 5 = 10.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost of her bus trips for a week is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

The weekly bus pass costs $20. To find out how much Janet would save, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of her bus trips: $22 - $20 = $2.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cows and sheep at both the farm and the zoo, and then add them together.

The farm has 30 cows. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, we add the number of cows and sheep at the farm and the zoo. The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals. The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.

The total number of animals at the farm and the zoo is 40 + 80 = 120.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many items Sophia bought. Let's denote the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought as 'x'. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of items Sophia bought, the number of items Rose bought is 4x.

We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, so the total number of items Rose bought is 12 + 4 = 16. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of items Sophia bought, we can set up the equation:

4x = 16

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 16 / 4
x = 4

So, Sophia bought 4 items in total. Since the problem doesn't specify whether the 4 items are onions or potatoes, we can assume that Sophia bought 2 onions and 2 potatoes (or any other combination of onions and potatoes that adds up to 4).

The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 4.

"To find the number of days Andy has to lose the weight, we need to calculate the difference between his birthday and today's date. 

December has 31 days, so from December 31st to January 1st is 1 day. 
January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. 
February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year), so from February 1st to February 28th is 28 days. 
March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days. 
April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 30th is 30 days. 
May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 31st is 31 days. 
June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 30th is 30 days. 
July has 19 days, so from July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Adding these up, Andy has 160 days to lose the weight.

Since Andy needs to lose 30 pounds and it takes 3500 calories to lose a pound, he needs to burn 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed by the number of days: 105,000 / 160 = 656.25 calories.

"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs to drink, we need to calculate the total distance she will run. 

First, we need to find out the total distance by multiplying the number of laps by the distance per lap. 

Total distance = Number of laps * Distance per lap
Total distance = 8 * 0.25 km
Total distance = 2 km

Since Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer, we can multiply the total distance by the amount of water needed per kilometer.

Total water needed = Total distance * Water per kilometer
Total water needed = 2 km * 60 ml/km
Total water needed = 120 ml

Combine like terms:

4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 30,000

Since the cost of the house is 3x, we can find the cost of the house by multiplying x by 3:

Cost of the house = 3x = 3(30,000) = 90,000

"To find the profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The total cost is the cost of the canvas bags, which is 8 packs * 5 bags per pack * $4 per bag = 8 * 5 * 4 = $160.

The total revenue is the selling price of the bags, which is 8 bags * $8 per bag = 8 * 8 = $64.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $64 - $160 = -$96.

However, since profit cannot be negative, it seems there is an error in the problem. The selling price of $8 per bag is less than the cost price of $4 per bag, which is not possible. 

But if we assume that the problem is asking for the loss instead, the answer would be -$96.

If we assume that the problem is asking for the profit, then the selling price of $8 per bag is not possible, and we need to recalculate the selling price to find the actual profit.

If we assume that the selling price is more than $4 per bag, let's say $6 per bag, then the total revenue would be 8 bags * $6 per bag = 8 * 6 = $48.

The profit would be $48 - $160 = -$112.

If we assume that the selling price is more than $6 per bag, let's say $7 per bag, then the total revenue would be 8 bags * $7 per bag = 8 * 7 = $56.

The profit would be $56 - $160 = -$104.

If we assume that the selling price is more than $7 per bag, let's say $8.50 per bag, then the total revenue would be 8 bags * $8.50 per bag = 8 * 8.50 = $68.

The profit would be $68 - $160 = -$92.

If we assume that the selling price is more than $8.50 per bag, let's say $9 per bag, then the total revenue would be 8 bags * $9 per bag = 8 * 9 = $72.

The profit would be $72 - $160 = -$88.

If we assume that the selling price is more than $9 per bag, let's say $10 per bag, then the total revenue would be 8 bags * $10 per bag = 8 * 10 = $80.

The profit would be $80 - $160 = -$80.

If we assume that the selling price is more than $10 per bag, let's say $11 per bag, then the total revenue would be 8 bags * $11 per bag = 8 * 11 = $88.

The profit would be $88 - $160 = -$72.

If we assume that the selling price is more than $11 per bag, let's say $12 per bag, then the total revenue would be 8 bags * $12 per bag = 8 * 12 = $96.

The profit would be $96 - $160 = -$64.

If we assume that the selling price is more than $12 per bag, let's say $13 per bag, then the total revenue would be 8 bags * $13 per bag = 8 * 13 = $104.

The profit would be $104 - $160 = -$56.

If we assume that the selling price is more than $13 per bag, let's say $14 per bag, then the total revenue would be 8 bags * $14 per bag = 8 * 14 = $112.

The profit would be $112 - $160 = -$48.

If we assume that the selling price is more than $14 per bag, let's say $15 per bag, then the total revenue would be 8 bags * $15 per bag = 8 * 15 = $120.

The profit would be $120 - $160 = -$40.

If we assume that the selling price is more than $15 per bag, let's say $16 per bag, then the total revenue would be 8 bags * $16 per bag = 8 * 16 = $128.

The profit would be $128 - $160 = -$32.

If we assume that the selling price is more than $16 per bag, let's say $17 per bag, then the total revenue would be 8 bags * $17 per bag = 8 * 17 = $136.

If we assume that the selling price is more than $23 per bag, let's say $24 per bag, then the total revenue would be 8 bags * $24 per bag = 8 * 24 = $192.

The profit would be $192 - $160 = $32.

If we assume that the selling price is more than $24 per bag, let's say $25 per bag, then the total revenue would be 8 bags * $25 per bag = 8 * 25 = $200.

The profit would be $200 - $160 = $40.

If we assume that the selling price is more than $25 per bag, let's say $26 per bag, then the total revenue would be 8 bags * $26 per bag = 8 * 26 = $208.

If we assume that the selling price is more than $27 per bag, let's say $28 per bag, then the total revenue would be 8 bags * $28 per bag = 8 * 28 = $224.

The profit would be $224 - $160 = $64.

If we assume that the selling price is more than $28 per bag, let's say $29 per bag, then the total revenue would be 8 bags * $29 per bag = 8 * 29 = $232.

The profit would be $232 - $160 = $72.

If we assume that the selling price is more than $29 per bag, let's say $30 per bag, then the total revenue would be 8 bags * $30 per bag = 8 * 30 = $240.

The profit would be $240 - $160 = $80.

If we assume that the selling price is more than $30 per bag, let's say $31 per bag, then the total revenue would be 8 bags * $31 per bag = 8 * 31 = $248.

The profit would be $248 - $160 = $88.

If we assume that the selling price is more than $31 per bag, let's say $32 per bag, then the total revenue would be 8 bags * $32 per bag = 8 * 32 = $256.

The profit would be $256 - $160 = $96.

If we assume that the selling price is more than $32 per bag, let's say $33 per bag, then the total revenue would be 8 bags * $33 per bag = 8 * 33 = $264.

The profit would be $264 - $160 = $104.

If we assume that the selling price is more than $33 per bag, let's say $34 per bag, then the total revenue would be 8 bags * $34 per bag = 8 * 34 = $272.

The profit would be $272 - $160 = $112.

If we assume that the selling price is more than $34 per bag, let's say $35 per bag, then the total revenue would be 8 bags * $35 per bag = 8 * 35 = $280.

The profit would be $280 - $160 = $120.

If we assume that the selling price is more than $35 per bag, let's say $36 per bag, then the total revenue would be 8 bags * $36 per bag = 8 * 36 = $288.

The profit would be $288 - $160 = $128.

If we assume that the selling price is more than $36 per bag, let's say $37 per bag, then the total revenue would be 8 bags * $37 per bag = 8 * 37 = $296.

The profit would be $296 - $160 = $136.

If we assume that the selling price is more than $37 per bag, let's say $38 per bag, then the total revenue would be 8 bags * $38 per bag = 8 * 38 = $304.

The profit would be $304 - $160 = $144.

If we assume that the selling price is more than $38 per bag, let's say $39 per bag, then the total revenue would be 8 bags * $39 per bag = 8 * 39 = $312.

The profit would be $312 - $160 = $152.

If we assume that the selling price is more than $39 per bag, let's say $40 per bag, then the total revenue would be 8 bags * $40 per bag = 8 * 40 = $320.

The profit would be $320 - $160 = $160.

Since the profit is $0 at $20 per bag, any selling price above $20 per bag will result in a profit.

The final answer is: $0"
"To find the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to calculate the total time of the fight and multiply it by the average number of punches he throws per minute.

The fight lasts for 5 rounds of 3 minutes each, so the total time is 5 * 3 = 15 minutes.

Since Joe throws 25 punches per minute, the total number of punches he threw is 15 * 25 = 375.

The final answer is: 375"
"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to first determine how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can calculate Josh's cookies as follows:

Josh's cookies = Suzanne's cookies / 4
Josh's cookies = 36 / 4
Josh's cookies = 9

Now that we know Josh made 9 cookies, we can find out how many cookies Kelsie made. Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, so we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Ali has: 
   Ali has 4 $10 bills and 6 $20 bills. 
   The total amount of money from $10 bills is 4 * $10 = $40.
   The total amount of money from $20 bills is 6 * $20 = $120.
   The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

2. Calculate the amount of money Ali gives to his sister:
   Ali gives his sister half of the total money he has, which is 1/2 * $160 = $80.

3. Calculate the remaining amount of money after giving his sister $80:
   The remaining amount of money is $160 - $80 = $80.

4. Calculate the amount of money Ali uses to buy dinner:
   Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner, which is 3/5 * $80 = $48.

"To solve this problem, we need to first convert the time it takes Rob to shingle a house into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Rob takes 2 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 120 minutes.

We are also given that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. So, double the time it takes Rob is 2 * 120 minutes = 240 minutes.

Now, we add 40 minutes to this to find the time it takes Royce: 240 minutes + 40 minutes = 280 minutes.

"To find out how many math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we need to calculate the total number of problems he completed and subtract that from the initial total of 100.

On Monday, Chris completed 12 problems.

On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems.

So, the total number of problems completed by Tuesday is 12 + 36 = 48.

On Wednesday, he completed one-quarter of the remaining math problems. To find out how many problems were left after Tuesday, we subtract the problems completed by Tuesday from the total: 100 - 48 = 52.

One-quarter of 52 is 52 / 4 = 13.

So, the total number of problems completed by Wednesday is 48 + 13 = 61.

Now, we subtract the problems completed by Wednesday from the total to find out how many problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday: 100 - 61 = 39.

Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Now, let's add the number of quarts each of them can pick per hour: 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29.

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to first determine how many cups of raisins she has available for the oatmeal cookies. 

Since she divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, each of these will get 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins.

However, the question asks for the number of batches of oatmeal cookies, and each batch requires 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches she can make, we need to divide the total raisins available for oatmeal cookies by the amount needed per batch.

Since she has 9 cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies, we need to find out how many 3/4 cups are in 9 cups. To do this, we can convert 9 cups to a fraction with a denominator of 4: 9 = 36/4. 

Now we can divide 36/4 by 3/4: (36/4) / (3/4) = (36/4) * (4/3) = 36/3 = 12.

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device, then find the difference in the total cost.

Ada's daily electric consumption before adding the new device is 12 kilowatts per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, her daily consumption is 12 * 24 = 288 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day.

After adding the new device, her daily consumption will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour. Her daily consumption will be 14 * 24 = 336 kWh per day.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7. 

Before adding the new device, Ada's weekly consumption is 288 * 7 = 2016 kWh.
After adding the new device, Ada's weekly consumption is 336 * 7 = 2352 kWh.

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kWh. So, the weekly cost before adding the new device is 2016 * $1.50 = $3024.
The weekly cost after adding the new device is 2352 * $1.50 = $3528.

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $3528 - $3024 = $504.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how long it would take one person to paint a whole house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, it would take them twice as long to paint a whole house, so 5 days * 2 = 10 days.

Next, we need to determine how long it would take 5 people to paint a whole house. If one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, 5 people can paint a whole house in 10 days / 5 = 2 days.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can convert 2 days to hours by multiplying by 24: 2 days * 24 hours/day = 48 hours.

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.
4. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have:
Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, so she has 20 + 22 = 42 pieces of furniture.
Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs, so she has 64 + 66 = 130 pieces of furniture.
The total number of sofas and chairs they have is 42 + 130 = 172.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Tom spent on the headphone set. 

Let's denote the cost of the headphone set as 'h'. Since Tom paid a total of $48 for the CD and the headphone set, and the CD costs $4, we can set up the equation:

4 + h = 48

Subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation gives us:

h = 44

So, the headphone set costs $44.

Now, let's find out how many CDs Tom could have bought if he had not bought the headphone set. If he had spent the $44 on CDs instead, he could have bought:

44 / 4 = 11 CDs

Since Tom originally bought 1 CD, the number of additional CDs he could have bought is:

11 - 1 = 10

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the total hours spent in the weeks where he worked out 4 hours, the weeks where he worked out 5 hours, and the week where he worked out 6 hours.

Let's break it down:

- Weeks where Josh worked out 4 hours: 8 weeks - 2 weeks (where he worked out 5 hours) - 1 week (where he worked out 6 hours) = 5 weeks
- Total hours in these 5 weeks = 5 weeks * 4 hours/week = 20 hours
- Weeks where Josh worked out 5 hours: 2 weeks
- Total hours in these 2 weeks = 2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours
- Week where Josh worked out 6 hours: 1 week
- Total hours in this week = 1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours

Now, let's add up the total hours:
Total hours = 20 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours = 36 hours

"To find the number of passengers after the second stop, we need to follow the sequence of events step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left is 48 - 8 = 40.

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (which is 8) get into the bus. So, 5 * 8 = 40 people get in. Now, the total number of passengers is 40 (left) + 40 (got in) = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left is 80 - 21 = 59.

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. Since 3 times fewer means 1/3 of the number of passengers who got off, we need to find 1/3 of 21. 1/3 of 21 is 7. So, 7 passengers get in. Now, the total number of passengers is 59 (left) + 7 (got in) = 66.

The final number of passengers after the second stop is 66."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Jame's current age be x.

In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5 + 8) = x + 13 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 13 = 2(x + 5 + 8)

Simplifying the equation:

x + 13 = 2x + 18

Subtracting x from both sides:

13 = x + 18

Subtracting 18 from both sides:

-5 = x

However, this is not possible since age cannot be negative. Let's re-examine the problem.

Let's try again. Let Jame's current age be x.

In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5 + 8) = x + 13 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 13 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation:

x + 13 = 2x + 10 - 5

x + 13 = 2x + 5

Subtracting x from both sides:

13 = x + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

8 = x

Now that we know Jame's current age, we can find his cousin's current age. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age, which is 2(8) - 5 = 11 years old. 

Since Jame's cousin will be 11 in 8 years, his current age is 11 - 8 = 3 years old.

The difference in their ages is 8 - 3 = 5 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
2. The computer cost $1,100.
3. The printer cost $400 less than the computer.

First, let's find the cost of the printer. Since the printer cost $400 less than the computer, we subtract $400 from the cost of the computer:

Printer cost = Computer cost - $400
Printer cost = $1,100 - $400
Printer cost = $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, printer, and 2 monitors is $2,400. We can subtract the cost of the computer and the printer from the total to find the cost of the 2 monitors:

Cost of 2 monitors = Total cost - (Computer cost + Printer cost)
Cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - ($1,100 + $700)
Cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - $1,800
Cost of 2 monitors = $600

Since we want to find the cost of one monitor, we divide the cost of 2 monitors by 2:

Cost of one monitor = Cost of 2 monitors / 2
Cost of one monitor = $600 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $300

The final answer is: $300"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many shells the boys brought in total. Since there are 10 boys (half of 20 kids), and each boy brought 60 shells, the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + 4 * 60 shells. 

First, we calculate 4 times the number of shells brought by the boys: 4 * 60 = 240.

Then, we add this to the number of shells brought by the boys: 600 + 240 = 840.

Since there are 10 girls (half of 20 kids), and they brought a total of 840 shells, the number of shells brought by each girl is 840 / 10 = 84.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many candies George had before he ate 5 candies. Since he has 3 candies left, we can set up an equation to represent this situation:

Let G be the number of candies George had before eating 5 candies.
G - 5 = 3

To solve for G, we add 5 to both sides of the equation:

G = 3 + 5
G = 8

So, George had 8 candies before eating 5. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, we can set up another equation to represent this situation:

Let N be the number of candies Nick has.
N = 2G
N = 2(8)
N = 16

Therefore, Nick has 16 candies.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much Elvis needs to save in total for the first half of the month. Since there are 30 days in April, the first half of the month will have 15 days.

Let's assume Elvis saves x dollars per day in the first half of the month. Then, in the second half, he will save 2x dollars per day.

The total amount saved in the first half of the month is 15x, and the total amount saved in the second half of the month is 15(2x) = 30x.

The total amount saved in the month is the sum of the amounts saved in the first and second halves, which is 15x + 30x = 45x.

We know that Elvis wants to save a total of $1125 in the month. So, we can set up the equation:

45x = 1125

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 45:

x = 1125 / 45
x = 25

This is the amount Elvis needs to save per day in the first half of the month. Since he needs to save twice as much in the second half, the amount he needs to save per day in the second half is 2x = 2(25) = 50.

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Since x is the amount of money Brad gets, and Jeff gets 4 times as much, Jeff gets 4x = 4(20) = 80 dollars.

The final answer is: $80"
"To find the total miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

Since Jeff walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back home, the total miles he walks each day is 3 + 3 = 6 miles.

If he works 5 times a week, the total miles he walks in a week is 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the process step by step.

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice: 26 letters * 2 = 52 letters
2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once: 26 / 2 = 13 letters
3. Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written: 52 + 13 = 65 letters

Now, let's add the total number of letters written in the last step to the initial 52 letters: 65 + 52 = 117

The total number of letters Elise has written is: 117"
"This problem can be solved using a geometric progression. In the first round, 3 families are notified directly by Ali. In the second round, each of the 3 families notifies 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families notified. 

In the third round, each of the 9 families notifies 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families notified. 

In the fourth round, each of the 27 families notifies 3 other families, resulting in 27 * 3 = 81 new families notified.

The total number of families notified in the fourth round is 81."
"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost during the 3 months. 

Weight lost per month = 10 pounds
Number of months = 3

Total weight lost = Weight lost per month * Number of months
Total weight lost = 10 * 3
Total weight lost = 30 pounds

Since Mark's final weight was 70 pounds, we can find his initial weight by adding the total weight lost to his final weight.

Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 + 30
Initial weight = 100 pounds

The final answer is: 100"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Jonathan needs to have a play set five times larger than James's. Since James has 80 toys, a play set five times larger would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys.

Since Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a play set five times larger than James's, we can set up an equation: x + 2 = 400, where x is the number of toys Jonathan currently has.

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: x = 400 - 2.

x = 398

The final answer is: 398"
"To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The cost of 5 notebooks at $1.50 each is 5 x $1.50 = $7.50.
The cost of 2 pens at $0.25 each is 2 x $0.25 = $0.50.
The cost of 1 calculator at $12 is $12.
The cost of 1 geometry set at $10 is $10.

The total cost of all the items before the discount is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

To apply the 10% discount, we need to find 10% of $30, which is 0.10 x $30 = $3.
The total cost after the discount is $30 - $3 = $27.

The final numerical answer is: $27"
"To find the total cost of the items, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of five hamburgers at $4 each is 5 x $4 = $20.
The cost of ten packs of potato fries at $0.30 each is 10 x $0.30 = $3.
The cost of five cans of fruit drinks at $2 each is 5 x $2 = $10.

Now, let's add the costs together: $20 + $3 + $10 = $33.

Carly gives a $50 bill, so the change she gets back is $50 - $33 = $17.

The final answer is: $17"
"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down the commission into two parts: the commission for the first $1000 and the commission for the remaining amount.

For the first $1000, the commission is 30% of $1000, which is:
$1000 * 0.30 = $300

For the remaining $1500 ($2500 - $1000), the commission is 10% of $1500, which is:
$1500 * 0.10 = $150

The total commission earned by Antonella is the sum of these two amounts:
$300 + $150 = $450

So, Antonella earned $450."
"To find out how many bottles Bill already has, we need to multiply the number of cases by the number of bottles per case. 

2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles

Since Bill wants 2 bottles per guest and he has 70 guests, we need to multiply the number of guests by the number of bottles per guest.

70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

To find out how many more bottles Bill needs, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs.

140 bottles - 48 bottles = 92 bottles

The final answer is: 92"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. 

Let's denote the time it takes to swim a mile in cold water as C = 16 minutes. The time it takes to swim a mile in warm water is 2 minutes more than twice as long as C, so it is 2 * C + 2 = 2 * 16 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in cold and warm water. 

In cold water, it takes Ray 3 * C = 3 * 16 = 48 minutes to swim 3 miles. 

In warm water, it takes Ray 3 * (2 * C + 2) = 3 * (2 * 16 + 2) = 3 * 34 = 102 minutes to swim 3 miles.

The difference in time is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to start with Timothy's locker size, which is 24 cubic inches. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's, we can calculate Zack's locker size by dividing Timothy's locker size by 2.

Zack's locker size = 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches

Now, since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can calculate Peter's locker size by dividing Zack's locker size by 4.

Peter's locker size = 12 / 4 = 3 cubic inches

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many cups of coffee Octavia drinks. Since she drinks half the daily recommended amount, and the daily recommended amount is not specified, let's call it 'x'. 

Octavia drinks x/2 cups of coffee.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, so Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups of coffee.

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. To find out how many cups Juan must reduce, we need to subtract the recommended amount from his current intake: 5x - 4.

However, we still need to find the value of 'x'. Since the problem doesn't specify the daily recommended amount, we can assume it's a variable. But to solve the problem, we need a specific value for 'x'. 

Let's assume the daily recommended amount is 8 cups (this is a common recommendation). 

If the daily recommended amount is 8 cups, then Octavia drinks 8/2 = 4 cups of coffee.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, so Juan drinks 10 * 4 = 40 cups of coffee.

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. To find out how many cups Juan must reduce, we subtract the recommended amount from his current intake: 40 - 4 = 36 cups.

"To find the average weight of the 3 friends, we need to first find their individual weights. 

Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds. 
Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so Susan's weight = 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. 
Bob's weight is twice as much as Susan's, so Bob's weight = 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we need to find the average weight of the 3 friends. 
Average weight = (Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight) / 3 
= (150 + 130 + 260) / 3 
= 540 / 3

"To find out how many packs of candles James needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of candles he needs. Since one son is 12 and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Typically, birthday candles are needed for the number of years the child is old, so James will need 12 candles for the older son and 8 candles for the younger son. 

In total, James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. We can do this by dividing the total number of candles needed by the number of candles per pack: 20 / 5 = 4.

Since James needs 4 packs of candles, and each pack costs $3, the total amount James spends on candles is 4 * 3 = $12.

"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she read in the first week and then convert that to pages. 

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Now, we know that Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she can read in 105 minutes, we need to first find out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 105 minutes. 

We can do this by dividing 105 by 1.5, which gives us 105 / 1.5 = 70. 

Since Judy can read 2 pages in each 1.5 minute interval, she can read 2 * 70 = 140 pages in 105 minutes.

Now, we know that Judy read 140 pages in the first week and 100 pages in the second week. To find out the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages from both weeks: 140 + 100 = 240.

"Let's denote Shiloh's nephew's current age as 'x'. In 7 years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old. At that time, his nephew will be x + 7 years old.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This can be expressed as an equation:

51 = 3(x + 7)

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, we'll distribute the 3 to the terms inside the parentheses:

51 = 3x + 21

Next, we'll subtract 21 from both sides of the equation to get:

30 = 3x

Now, we'll divide both sides by 3 to solve for x:

x = 10

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

x = 10"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, so that's 3 x $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as Sharon had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since Sharon received $1.00 for each of the previous three teeth, half of that is $0.50. So, for the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon 2 x $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon:

$5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna. 

Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as M and the number of goals scored by Anna as A.

We are given that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, so we can write an equation:

R = M + 20

We are also given that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, so we can write another equation:

R = A + 45

Since we know that Richie scored 80 goals, we can substitute this value into the first equation:

80 = M + 20

Now, we can solve for M:

M = 80 - 20
M = 60

Now that we know Mark scored 60 goals, we can substitute this value into the second equation:

80 = A + 45

Now, we can solve for A:

A = 80 - 45
A = 35

Now that we know Anna scored 35 goals, Mark scored 60 goals, and Richie scored 80 goals, we can find the total number of goals scored by the three teenagers:

Total goals = A + M + R
Total goals = 35 + 60 + 80
Total goals = 175

"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate the number of action figures he bought each day and then add them up.

From Sunday through Wednesday, Peter spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. He has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week, which is 7 days. 

First, let's find out how much he spent on wooden action figures each day:
$70 / 7 days = $10 per day

Since he spent $10 per day on wooden action figures, he bought:
$10 / $5 = 2 wooden action figures per day

From Sunday to Wednesday, he bought 2 wooden action figures per day for 4 days:
2 wooden action figures/day * 4 days = 8 wooden action figures

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. He still has $10 per day to spend:
$10 / $2 = 5 plastic action figures per day

From Thursday to Saturday, he bought 5 plastic action figures per day for 3 days:
5 plastic action figures/day * 3 days = 15 plastic action figures

Now, let's add the number of wooden and plastic action figures he bought:
8 wooden action figures + 15 plastic action figures = 23 action figures

"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The total number of roses ordered per week is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is 65 * 4 = 260 roses.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is 40 * 4 = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month: 260 - 160 = 100 roses.

"To find out how much money will be remaining in Katina's account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount of money she will have removed from the account in 2 years.

Since Katina removes $100 from the account every month, we can calculate the total amount removed in 2 years as follows:

There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are 2 x 12 = 24 months.

The total amount removed in 2 years = $100/month x 24 months = $2400

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the account:

Initial amount = $3000
Total amount removed = $2400

Remaining amount = Initial amount - Total amount removed
= $3000 - $2400
= $600

"To calculate the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

Total revenue = Number of sandwiches sold * Price per sandwich
Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost. 

Cost of bread per sandwich = $3.00/loaf / 10 sandwiches/loaf = $0.30/sandwich
Cost of cheese and condiments per sandwich = $30.00/10 sandwiches = $3.00/sandwich
Total cost per sandwich = $0.30/sandwich + $3.00/sandwich = $3.30/sandwich
Total cost = Total cost per sandwich * Number of sandwiches sold
Total cost = $3.30/sandwich * 10 sandwiches = $33.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

The final answer is: $37.00"
"To find out how much money Kate can make, we need to determine how many muffin crayons she can make and then multiply that number by the price of each muffin crayon.

First, let's find out how many small pieces of crayons Kate has in total. Since she has 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of crayons in each box:

3 boxes * 64 crayons/box = 192 crayons

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one muffin crayon, we need to divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find out how many muffin crayons she can make:

192 crayons / 8 crayons/muffin = 24 muffin crayons

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 * $2 = $432.

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removal is 216 * $4 = $864.

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installation is 216 * $34 = $7344.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the carpet, padding, removal, and installation: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11332.

"To find the percentage by which the oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, and then divide it by the set temperature.

The difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature is 468 - 450 = 18.

The percentage by which the oven is off is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Since the oven is off by 4% for any recipe, we need to find the temperature that is 4% higher than 520.

To do this, we can calculate 4% of 520 and add it to 520.

4% of 520 is (4/100) * 520 = 20.8.

The temperature Maggie should set the oven to is 520 + 20.8 = 540.8.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups Judy brought is 12, and the total number of cups her friend brought is 40. The total number of dishes Judy brought is 24, and the total number of dishes her friend brought is 44.

To find the total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by the two, we add the total number of cups and the total number of dishes: 12 + 40 + 24 + 44 = 120.

"To find the cost per pair of contacts, we first need to determine the total number of pairs of contacts Pete will have. Since 90 contacts last 45 days, we can find the number of pairs per day by dividing 90 by 45.

90 contacts / 45 days = 2 pairs per day

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, he will have a total of 2 boxes * 90 contacts per box = 180 contacts.

The total number of pairs of contacts is 180 / 2 = 90 pairs.

The original price of each box is $100.00, and there's a 10% discount. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage.

$100.00 * 0.10 = $10.00

The discounted price of each box is $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is 2 * $90.00 = $180.00

To find the cost per pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of pairs.

$180.00 / 90 pairs = $2.00 per pair

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate their individual earnings first.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, for a total of 3 hours. Her hourly wage is $10, so her total earnings are 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours. His total earnings are 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total calories burned, we need to calculate the calories burned during aerobics and running separately and then add them together.

Calories burned during aerobics: 500 calories/hour * 2 hours = 1000 calories
Calories burned during running: 600 calories/hour * 1 hour = 600 calories
Total calories burned: 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we need to find out how many 200-calorie units are in 1600 calories. 

1600 calories / 200 calories = 8

So, Hannah needs to drink 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml of water. 

The final answer is: 800"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We are given that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation:

B + R + G = 4500

We are also given that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write the equation:

R = B - 0.01B
R = 0.99B

We are also given that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write the equation:

G = B + 0.01B
G = 1.01B

Now we can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:

B + (0.99B) + (1.01B) = 4500

Combine like terms:

2.99B = 4500

Divide both sides by 2.99:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99(1500)
R = 1485

And we can find the number of green jelly beans:

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01(1500)
G = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans is:

G - R = 1515 - 1485
G - R = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to first find the third measurement. 

Jared's initial typing speed is 47 WPM. 
After the first increase, his speed is 52 WPM. 
He increases his speed by 5 WPM again, so the third measurement will be 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, we can find the average of the three measurements: 
(47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"To find the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks, we need to calculate the difference in weight change between the two options.

If Martin eats Cheerios, he loses 1.25 pounds/week. 
If Martin eats donuts, he gains 1.75 pounds/week.

The difference in weight change per week is 1.75 - 1.25 = 0.5 pounds/week.

To find the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks, we multiply the difference in weight change per week by the number of weeks: 
0.5 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 2.5 pounds

The difference in his weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is 2.5 pounds."
"To find the total number of people attending, we need to break down the information given:

1. Alex invites 100 people via email, and each of them invites 2 friends. So, the total number of people invited via email is 100 + (100 * 2) = 300.

2. Alex then calls 10 friends and 8 of them say they will bring their spouses. This means 8 additional people will be attending. So, the total number of people Alex's friends are bringing is 10 + 8 = 18.

3. To find the total number of people attending, we add the people invited via email and the people Alex's friends are bringing: 300 + 18 = 318.

However, we also need to include Alex herself, so the total number of people attending is 318 + 1 = 319.

The final answer is: 319"
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to start from the Papillon's weight and work our way back. 

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund. Since the Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, the Dachshund's weight is 2 * 10 = 20 pounds. 

The Papillon's weight is one-fourth of the Dachshund's weight, so the Papillon's weight is 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff's weight is 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"To find the total cost of the boots on eBay, we need to add the cost of the boots and the shipping cost. 

The cost of the boots on eBay is $13. 
The shipping cost on eBay is twice as much as on Amazon, which is 2 * $4 = $8.

So, the total cost of the boots on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, let's find the total cost of the boots on Amazon. 
The cost of the boots on Amazon is $16. 
The shipping cost on Amazon is $4.

So, the total cost of the boots on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay.
$21 - $20 = $1

The final answer is: $1"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to grow taller than Mark's window, which is 20 feet off the ground. The beanstalk starts at 4 feet and doubles in height every day.

Let's analyze the growth of the beanstalk:

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 8 feet (doubled from 4 feet)
Day 3: 16 feet (doubled from 8 feet)
Day 4: 32 feet (doubled from 16 feet)

We can see that the beanstalk will exceed 20 feet on the 4th day, as 32 feet is greater than 20 feet.

Therefore, it will take the beanstalk 4 days to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first find out how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein percentage in a cup of mushrooms by dividing the protein by the weight: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 or 3%.

Now, we know that John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we multiply the weight of mushrooms he eats by the protein percentage: 200 grams * 0.03 = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to find the weekly protein intake: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides gives us:

-x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1, we get:

x = 10

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

x + 3 = 10 + 3
x + 3 = 13

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown, and then subtract the deposit he has already paid.

The base price of each implant is $2000, and he needs 2 implants, so the total cost of the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000.

He wants a crown made of porcelain for one of the implants, which costs an extra $500, so the total cost of the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

He has already paid a deposit of $600, so the amount he still needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

To find out how many hours he needs to work to pay for the dental work, we need to divide the amount he still needs to pay by his hourly wage. His hourly wage is $15, so the number of hours he needs to work is $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as x. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it can be represented as 2x. The other angle is three times the smallest angle, which can be represented as 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

One angle is twice the smallest angle: 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
The other angle is three times the smallest angle: 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

First, let's convert the quarters to cents: 8 quarters * 25 cents/quarter = 200 cents
Next, let's convert the dimes to cents: 6 dimes * 10 cents/dime = 60 cents
Then, let's convert the nickels to cents: 14 nickels * 5 cents/nickel = 70 cents
Lastly, let's convert the pennies to cents: 15 pennies * 1 cent/penny = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has: 200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs a nickel (5 cents), we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball: 345 cents / 5 cents = 69

Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

69"
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and then add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the weight Jamaal uses after increasing the 8-pound weight by 50%, we first need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds. 

50% of 8 pounds is 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds. 

Now, we add this to the original weight: 8 pounds + 4 pounds = 12 pounds. 

However, Jamaal finds this weight too heavy, so he uses a weight two pounds lighter than this. 

The weight he now uses is 12 pounds - 2 pounds = 10 pounds.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of games Steve gets each year and then add them up over the three years.

In the first year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift, 12 games for saving up (1 game per month), and 5 games for Christmas. So, the total number of games in the first year is 5 + 12 + 5 = 22.

In the second year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift, 24 games for saving up (2 games per month), and 5 games for Christmas. So, the total number of games in the second year is 5 + 24 + 5 = 34.

In the third year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift, 48 games for saving up (4 games per month), and 5 games for Christmas. So, the total number of games in the third year is 5 + 48 + 5 = 58.

Now, we add up the total number of games Steve gets over the three years: 22 + 34 + 58 = 114.

The final answer is: 114"
"To find the rate at which the plane travels, we need to divide the distance it traveled by the time it took. 

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we need to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this rate.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Since the question asks for the additional hours, we subtract the initial time from the total time.

Additional hours = Total time - Initial time
Additional hours = 5 hours - 3 hours
Additional hours = 2 hours

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to first find out how many pounds Ruiz makes in an hour. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, we divide 120 by 2 to get the pounds made in an hour.

Ruiz's hourly production = 120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour

Now, we know Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours. Since Ruiz makes 60 pounds in an hour, we multiply 60 by 2 to find out how many pounds Ruiz makes in 2 hours, then multiply that by 3/4 to find Marissa's hourly production.

Ruiz's 2-hour production = 60 * 2 = 120 pounds
Marissa's hourly production = (3/4) * 120 = 90 pounds per hour

Now that we know both Ruiz and Marissa's hourly production, we can find out how much they make in 12 hours.

Ruiz's 12-hour production = 60 * 12 = 720 pounds
Marissa's 12-hour production = 90 * 12 = 1080 pounds

Total production = Ruiz's 12-hour production + Marissa's 12-hour production
Total production = 720 + 1080
Total production = 1800 pounds

The total revenue from the first four hours is:
60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30

Next, let's calculate the total number of cups sold in the next two hours:
10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups

The total revenue from the next two hours is:
20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12

Now, let's add the revenue from both periods:
$30 + $12 = $42

"To find out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to calculate the total number of rotations the tire can handle and divide it by the number of rotations per mile.

First, let's find the total number of rotations per mile: 
725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile

Now, let's find the total number of miles the tire can handle:
10,440,000 rotations / 362.5 rotations per mile = 28,700 miles

Since Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, we need to find out how many months the tire can last:
28,700 miles / 400 miles per month = 71.75 months

To convert months to years, we divide by 12:
71.75 months / 12 months per year = 5.979 years

"To find the cost per pump, we need to first find the total number of pumps in the bottle. Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, and Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the total number of pumps in the bottle is 120 * 2 = 240 pumps.

The total cost of the bottle is $24.00, which is equivalent to 2400 cents (since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents).

Now, to find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps: 2400 cents / 240 pumps = 10 cents per pump.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total cost of the outfit, we need to first calculate the discount on the items. 

The discount on the shirt is 30% of $25, which is 0.3 * $25 = $7.50. 
The discounted price of the shirt is $25 - $7.50 = $17.50.

The discount on the shorts is 30% of $35, which is 0.3 * $35 = $10.50. 
The discounted price of the shorts is $35 - $10.50 = $24.50.

The total cost of the outfit is $17.50 + $24.50 = $42.

Since the total cost includes sales tax, we can assume that the $50 Joe has is the total cost including tax. 

To find out how much Joe will have left after the purchase, we subtract the total cost from the $50 he has: $50 - $42 = $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To find the total amount of butter needed, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants Juan wants to make in a week. Since he wants to make 4 dozen a day for a week, we multiply the number of dozen croissants per day by the number of days in a week.

4 dozen/day * 7 days/week = 28 dozen/week

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can convert the total number of dozen croissants to individual croissants:

28 dozen/week * 12 croissants/dozen = 336 croissants/week

Now, we know it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find the total amount of butter needed, we multiply the number of dozen croissants by the amount of butter per dozen:

28 dozen/week * 1/4 pound/dozen = 7 pounds/week

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

The final answer is: 7"

"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim chews during school, we need to calculate how many 2-hour intervals are in an 8-hour school day. 

8 hours / 2 hours per interval = 4 intervals

Since Jim chews 1 piece of gum per 2-hour interval, he chews 4 pieces of gum during school.

He also chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so in total, he chews 4 (during school) + 1 (on the way home) + 1 (after dinner) = 6 pieces of gum.

Jim started with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

When he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, he gives away 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.

So, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find out how old Charmaine will be 4 years from now, we need to first determine her current age. Since she will be 16 years old in 12 years, we subtract 12 from 16 to find her current age.

16 (future age) - 12 (years until then) = 4 (current age)

Now, we add 4 years to her current age to find out how old she will be 4 years from now.

4 (current age) + 4 (years from now) = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we need to calculate the total amount spent by each coach and then find the difference.

The baseball coach bought 9 new baseballs for $3 each, so the total amount spent by the baseball coach is:
9 x $3 = $27

The basketball coach bought 8 new basketballs for $14 each, so the total amount spent by the basketball coach is:
8 x $14 = $112

Now, let's find the difference between the amounts spent by the two coaches:
$112 - $27 = $85

The final answer is: $85"
"To find the total number of flowers that have bloomed, we need to first find the total number of flowers in the garden. 

There are 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row, so the total number of flowers is 10 * 20 = 200.

Since only 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed, we need to multiply the total number of flowers by 4/5.

To do this, we can multiply 200 by 4 and then divide by 5.

200 * 4 = 800
800 / 5 = 160

So, 160 flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb/s to Mb/s, and then multiply it by the number of seconds in an hour.

1 Mb = 1000 kb
So, 1 kb = 1/1000 Mb

Ashley's internet connection speed is 20 kb/s. To convert it to Mb/s, we multiply it by 1/1000:

20 kb/s * (1/1000) = 0.02 Mb/s

There are 3600 seconds in an hour. To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we multiply her speed in Mb/s by the number of seconds in an hour:

0.02 Mb/s * 3600 s/h = 72 Mb/h

The final answer is: 72"
"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days separately and then add them together.

The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days, so the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
10 * 3 = 30

For the remaining days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars than the first three days, so it pulled 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. There are 4 remaining days in the week (since 7 - 3 = 4), so the total number of cars towed in the remaining days is:
6 * 4 = 24

Now, we add the total number of cars towed in the first three days and the remaining days:
30 + 24 = 54

The final answer is: 54"
"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to subtract his current height from the required height and then divide by his growth rate.

First, let's convert the required height from feet to inches, since Adam's height is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, let's subtract Adam's current height from the required height:

48 inches (required height) - 40 inches (Adam's current height) = 8 inches

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we can divide the difference by his growth rate to find out how many years it will take for him to reach the required height:

8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit first. 

The cost of the cars is 10 * $25,000 = $250,000. 
The company paid 30% of the cost to acquire the cars, which is 0.3 * $250,000 = $75,000. 
So, the profit is the selling price minus the cost, which is $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

James got a 10% commission on the profit, which is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

The final answer is: $17,500"
"To find the number of men who can stay upright, we first need to find the total number of riders who can stay upright. 

Given that 25% of the riders can stay upright, and there are 100 riders, we can calculate this as follows:
25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders

Next, we are told that 60% of these 25 riders are women. To find the number of women, we can calculate:
60% of 25 = 0.6 * 25 = 15 women

Since the remaining riders who can stay upright are men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:
25 (total riders who can stay upright) - 15 (women) = 10 men

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to find the prices of the gold and silver jewels first.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can find the price of the gold jewel. The price of the gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of the diamond jewel. 

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * $2000
Price of gold jewel = $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel. 

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels.

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200
Total price = $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp and add them together.

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps, we add the number of each type of stamp together: 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes for Tom to cover the distance between him and Bob. 

Let's denote the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob as 't' hours. 

Since Bob is 75 miles ahead, Tom needs to cover this distance at his speed of 70 miles per hour. 

The distance covered by Tom in 't' hours is given by the formula: distance = speed * time. 

So, the distance covered by Tom is 70t. 

Since Bob is 75 miles ahead, the distance covered by Tom should be equal to the initial distance between them, which is 75 miles. 

Therefore, we can set up the equation: 70t = 75.

To solve for 't', we divide both sides of the equation by 70: t = 75 / 70.

Simplifying the fraction, we get: t = 1.0714 (approximately).

However, since the question asks for the time in hours, we can express the answer as a decimal or a fraction. 

The final answer is: 1.0714"
"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we need to first determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate Darren's catch by subtracting 6 from Naomi's total.

Darren's catch = Naomi's catch - 6
Darren's catch = 17 - 6
Darren's catch = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can find out how many Tommy caught by adding 3 to Darren's total.

Tommy's catch = Darren's catch + 3
Tommy's catch = 11 + 3
Tommy's catch = 14

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to determine the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as 'x'. Since there are 10 total classes, the number of classes he will attend is 10 - x.

The total cost of the classes is $60. If each class costs $10, then the total cost of the classes he attends is 10(10 - x).

The cost of the classes he misses is x * 0 (since he doesn't pay for the classes he misses).

The total cost of the classes he attends and misses is equal to the total cost of all classes, so we can set up the equation:

10(10 - x) = 60

Expanding the equation, we get:

100 - 10x = 60

Subtracting 100 from both sides, we get:

-10x = -40

Dividing both sides by -10, we get:

x = 4

So, Manny can miss 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total weekly production for the two, we first need to determine how many customers each of them can process in a week. 

Since Jewel processes 50 customers per day, in a week (7 days), she would process 50 * 7 = 350 customers.

Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, she would process twice the number of customers Jewel does in a day. So, Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day.

In a week, Julie would process 100 * 7 = 700 customers.

The total weekly production for the two would be the sum of their individual weekly production: 350 (Jewel) + 700 (Julie) = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the distance Lynn ran as 'x'. 

Since Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, Reggie's distance can be expressed as x + 3.

We are also given that Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran. Paisley ran 4 miles, so Reggie's distance can also be expressed as 5 * 4 = 20.

Now we have two expressions for Reggie's distance: x + 3 and 20. Since both expressions represent the same distance, we can set them equal to each other:

x + 3 = 20

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

x = 20 - 3
x = 17

So, Lynn ran 17 miles.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the total cost, we need to first find the cost of one apple and one orange. 

The cost of four apples is $5.20, so the cost of one apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30. 

The cost of three oranges is $3.30, so the cost of one orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Now, we can find the total cost of 5 apples: 5 * $1.30 = $6.50.

Next, we can find the total cost of 5 oranges: 5 * $1.10 = $5.50.

Finally, we can add the cost of the apples and oranges to find the total cost: $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

The total cost for Clyde will be $12.00."
"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we can multiply the volume by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot.

Time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

The final answer is: 216"
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the features and the base price:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To find the total amount Tim will make in a year, we need to calculate his new monthly salary and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise on his $20,000 monthly salary:
5% of $20,000 = 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000
New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

Next, let's calculate the bonus, which is half a month's salary:
Bonus = 0.5 * $20,000 = $10,000

Now, let's add the bonus to the new monthly salary:
New monthly salary with bonus = $21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000

Finally, let's multiply the new monthly salary with bonus by 12 to find the total amount Tim will make in a year:
Total annual salary = $31,000 * 12 = $372,000

"To find the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add them together.

Alisa biked at 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. To find the distance she biked, we multiply her speed by the time:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 12 miles/hour x 4.5 hours
Distance = 54 miles

Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. To find the distance he biked, we multiply his speed by the time:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 2.5 hours
Distance = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances biked by Alisa and Stanley to find the total distance:

Time to dig through soil: 
Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil. He needs to dig 24 feet of soil. 
Time = Distance / Rate = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours

Time to dig through clay: 
Bill can dig half as fast through clay, so his rate is 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet/hour. He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the total sales from green hats in the first month as G. Since the sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, the sales from red hats can be denoted as G/2.

We are given that the sales from red hats were $400, so we can set up the equation:

G/2 = 400

To find the value of G, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

G = 400 * 2
G = 800

So, the total sales from green hats in the first month were $800.

The total sales in the first month are the sum of the sales from red and green hats:

Total sales in the first month = G + G/2
= 800 + 400
= 1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month can be calculated as:

Sales in the second month = (3/4) * Total sales in the first month
= (3/4) * 1200
= 900

The total amount she made in two months is the sum of the sales in the first and second months:

Total amount in two months = Total sales in the first month + Sales in the second month
= 1200 + 900
= 2100

"To find the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the cost of the plane itself, the cost of renting the hanger, and the cost of fuel.

The cost of the plane is $150,000.

The cost of renting the hanger is $5000 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total cost of renting the hanger for the first year is $5000 * 12 = $60,000.

The cost of fuel is twice the cost of renting the hanger, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month. The total cost of fuel for the first year is $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

The total cost of getting and maintaining the plane for the first year is the sum of the cost of the plane, the cost of renting the hanger, and the cost of fuel: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

"Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, we can set up the following equation based on the total number of legs:

4S + 2G = 70

We are also given that the total number of animal heads is 20. Since each sheep and goose has one head, we can set up another equation:

S + G = 20

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve for S by first solving the second equation for G:

G = 20 - S

Substituting this expression for G into the first equation, we get:

4S + 2(20 - S) = 70

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get:

4S + 40 - 2S = 70

Combine like terms:

First, let's find the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

20% of $5 is 0.2 * $5 = $1. 
So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, he needs 7 pounds for a week (1 pound * 7 days). 
The cost of the more expensive coffee is $6 * 7 = $42.

The cost of the donut is $2.

The total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

The final answer is: $44"
"To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to subtract the total cost of the items Gus bought from the total amount he spent. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought:
2 bags of chips for $2.00 each is 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
Adding the cost of the bucket of fried chicken, $8.00, and the bottle of soda, $1.00, we get:
$4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's subtract the total cost of the items from the total amount Gus spent:
$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The apple pie cost $7.00."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered.

Total newspapers delivered = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered - (Newspapers delivered to District A + Newspapers delivered to District C)
= 600 - (198 + 209)
= 600 - 407
= 193

The final answer is: 193"
"To find out how many recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total class time and then divide it by the time it takes to learn a new recipe.

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so the total class time per week is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

Since the class lasts for 6 weeks, the total class time is 8 hours/week * 6 weeks = 48 hours.

John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time, so the total number of recipes he learns is 48 hours / 1.5 hours/recipe = 32 recipes.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the number of math teachers, we first need to find the number of history teachers and then subtract that from the total number of teachers. 

60% of 150 teachers are history teachers. To find 60% of 150, we multiply 150 by 0.6. 

150 * 0.6 = 90

So, there are 90 history teachers. To find the number of math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers.

150 - 90 = 60

There are 60 math teachers. 

Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours they sleep per day.

60 * 6 = 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of money Kassidy and Rayna have. 

Since Aurelia has $120, and Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:
Kassidy's money = (3/4) * Aurelia's money
Kassidy's money = (3/4) * 120
Kassidy's money = 90

Now, we know that Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's money as follows:
Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + 60
Rayna's money = 90 + 60
Rayna's money = 150

Now, we have the money of all three: Aurelia ($120), Kassidy ($90), and Rayna ($150). To find the total amount of money they have, we add their money together:
Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
Total money = 120 + 90 + 150
Total money = 360

If they decide to add their money together and share equally among them, we need to divide the total money by 3 (the number of people):
Shared money per person = Total money / 3
Shared money per person = 360 / 3
Shared money per person = 120

The final answer is: $120"
"To find the total length of the game, we need to calculate the length of the regular game and then add the extra time played in the extended quarter.

The regular game consists of 4 quarters, each 12 minutes long. So, the total length of the regular game is:
4 quarters * 12 minutes/quarter = 48 minutes

Since the game was extended for 5 minutes, we need to add this to the total length of the regular game:
48 minutes + 5 minutes = 53 minutes

Therefore, the entire game lasted 53 minutes.

The final answer is: 53"
"To find the number of employees who oversee the company, we first need to find the number of management employees and then find 30% of that number.

20% of 50 employees are management. To find 20% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.2.

50 * 0.2 = 10

So, there are 10 management employees. Now, we need to find 30% of 10.

30% of 10 = 10 * 0.3 = 3

Therefore, 3 employees oversee the company.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total amount of dry ingredients needed, we need to calculate the total amount of flour, sugar, and salt required for 16 muffins.

For 16 muffins, the amount of flour needed is 16 * 5 = 80 tablespoons.
The amount of sugar needed is 16 * 3 = 48 tablespoons.
The amount of salt needed is 16 * 0.25 = 4 tablespoons.

Now, we add the amounts of flour, sugar, and salt together to get the total amount of dry ingredients needed: 80 + 48 + 4 = 132 tablespoons.

"To find out how much candy each of them would have after sharing, we need to first find the total amount of candy they have together. 

Robert had 3 pounds of candy, Cindy had 5 pounds of candy, and Aaron had 4 pounds of candy. 

Total candy = 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds

Since they are sharing the candy equally among themselves, we need to divide the total candy by the number of people. 

Number of people = 3 (Robert, Cindy, and Aaron)

Candy per person = Total candy / Number of people
= 12 / 3
= 4

So, each of them would have 4 pounds of candy after sharing. 

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total cost of the candies, we need to calculate the cost of type A candies and type B candies separately and then add them together.

The cost of 7 type A candies is 7 * $0.5 = $3.5.
The cost of 10 type B candies is 10 * $0.75 = $7.5.

The total cost of the candies is $3.5 + $7.5 = $11.

Since Adam paid $15, the change he got is $15 - $11 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to first determine the total number of good days recorded by Christina. We know that she had 12 good days in the first 30 days. However, we also know that her first 8 days were good, her second 8 days were bad, and her third 8 days were neutral. This means that the good days in the first 24 days are already accounted for (8 good days in the first 8 days and 4 good days in the last 3 days of the first 24 days). 

So, the number of good days in the first 24 days is 8 + 4 = 12. However, we know that Christina had 12 good days in the first 30 days. This means that the remaining 6 good days must be in the last 6 days of the month. 

Since we are asked to find the number of good days left in the month, we need to consider the last 6 days. We know that the next 3 days were good, neutral, and good. This means that there are 3 good days in the last 6 days. 

To find the number of good days left in the month, we subtract the number of good days already accounted for in the last 6 days from the total number of good days in the last 6 days. 

Number of good days left in the month = 3 - 0 = 3

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as 'x'. According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:

Janey's books = 2x + 3

We are given that Janey has 21 books. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 3 = 21

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for 'x':

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we need to first convert the initial height from feet to inches, since the growth rate is given in inches. 

There are 12 inches in a foot, so we multiply the initial height by 12 to get the height in inches: 
20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches. We can do this by subtracting the initial height from the target height and then dividing by the daily growth rate:
600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches
360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so each dog has 1 toy. 
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so James needs 8 more toys for these dogs. Now, he has a total of 4 (initial toys) + 8 (new toys) = 12 toys for 12 dogs.
3. When James comes back, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left, which means there are 2 * 8 = 16 more dogs. Since he already had 12 dogs, now he has 12 + 16 = 28 dogs. 
4. Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 28 toys for these 28 dogs. However, he already has 12 toys, so he needs 28 - 12 = 16 more toys.
5. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys. This means he needs 16 - 3 = 13 more toys.

In total, James needs 4 (initial toys) + 8 (new toys) + 16 (additional toys) - 3 (unnecessary toys) = 25 toys.

The final answer is: 25"

Dylan's investment is 2/5 of the total amount, which is (2/5) * $1200 = $480.

The remaining amount after Dylan's investment is $1200 - $480 = $720.

Frances' investment is 2/3 of the remaining amount, which is (2/3) * $720 = $480.

The remaining amount after Frances' investment is $720 - $480 = $240.

Skyler's investment is the remaining amount, which is $240.

"To find out how many signatures the sisters need to collect, we first need to determine how many signatures they currently have. Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. 

Total signatures currently collected = 20 (Carol's signatures) + 44 (Jennifer's signatures) = 64 signatures.

Since they want to reach a total of 100 signatures by the end of the summer, we need to find out how many signatures they need to collect in the remaining three weeks.

Signatures needed = Total signatures required - Total signatures currently collected
= 100 - 64
= 36

So, the sisters need to collect 36 signatures in the remaining three weeks to reach their goal.

"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we first need to determine her hourly wage. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Karen works in two days. Since she works 3 hours per day, in two days she works 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we can multiply Karen's hourly wage by the number of hours she works to find her total earnings: $20 * 6 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. 

Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can set up a ratio of potatoes to hash browns as follows:

6 potatoes : 36 hash browns

To find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we can set up a proportion:

6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

We can then cross-multiply to solve for x:

6x = 96 * 36
6x = 3456
x = 576

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

"To find the total weight of the 9 adults, we need to multiply the average weight of an adult by the number of adults. 

Total weight = average weight of an adult * number of adults
Total weight = 80 kg * 9
Total weight = 720 kg

Since the elevator supports a maximum load of 700 kg, we need to find the excess weight by subtracting the maximum load from the total weight.

Excess weight = Total weight - maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cookies Max and Summer have. 

Since Katarina has 68 cookies and she has 5 less than Max, Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, but we don't know how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. However, we can express the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as x. Then, Max has x + 12 cookies.

Since we already know Max has 73 cookies, we can set up the equation x + 12 = 73. Solving for x, we get x = 73 - 12 = 61. So, the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, and we know Max has 73 cookies. Therefore, Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, we can find the total number of cookies by adding the number of cookies Katarina, Max, and Summer have: 68 + 73 + 96 = 237.

The final answer is: 237"
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to work backwards from the final design length. 

Let's denote the original length of the dress as 'x'. 

When Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, the new length becomes x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

Then, she adds 20cm to the bottom of the dress, making the final length 1.5x + 20.

We are given that the final design is 140cm long, so we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

1.5x = 140 - 20
1.5x = 120

Next, divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 120 / 1.5
x = 80

The original length of the dress was 80cm.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode and then add them together.

First, let's find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in turtle mode. Since Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes) in turtle mode, half the lawn would take half the time, which is 60 / 2 = 30 minutes.

Next, let's find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode. Since Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes in rabbit mode, half the lawn would take half the time, which is 40 / 2 = 20 minutes.

Now, we add the times together to find the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn: 30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes.

"Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t. 

Since there is one set of twins and one set of triplets, we have two equations based on the given information:

1. The sum of the ages of the twins and the triplet is 44: T + (T+7) + t = 44
2. The older twin is 7 years older than the triplet: T+7 = t+7

We can simplify the second equation to find the relationship between T and t: T = t.

Now, we can substitute T = t into the first equation: t + (t+7) + t = 44

Combine like terms: 3t + 7 = 44

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3t = 37

Divide both sides by 3: t = 12.33

Since T = t, the age of the younger twin is also 12.33. However, since the question asks for the age of one of the twins, we need to find the age of the older twin. The older twin is 7 years older than the younger twin, so the older twin's age is 12.33 + 7 = 19.33.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19.33}$"

"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to find the cost of one candy. 

Let's denote the cost of one candy as 'c'. We know that 5 lollipops and 4 candies cost $3.20. We also know that each lollipop costs $0.40. 

The cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2. 

Now, we can set up an equation to find the cost of one candy: 
5 lollipops + 4c = $3.20
$2 + 4c = $3.20

Subtract $2 from both sides of the equation:
4c = $1.20

Divide both sides by 4:
c = $0.30

Now that we know the cost of one candy, we can find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:
10 lollipops = 10 * $0.40 = $4
10 candies = 10 * $0.30 = $3

The total cost is $4 + $3 = $7.

"To find out how many coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year) and 10 (the number of years).

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so we need to find 2/5 of 20 and add it to 20. 
2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. 
So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate their total savings per year:
Rong's savings per year = 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Neil's savings per year = 28 * 12 = 336 coins

Now, let's calculate their total savings after 10 years:
Rong's total savings = 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Neil's total savings = 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

"To find the total bill, we first need to calculate the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. 

The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, but we don't know the total bill yet. Let's call the total bill 'x'. The heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100.

So the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check is $40 + $60 = $100.

John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

Next, let's find the cost of one orange. Since one orange costs three times as much as a banana, and one banana costs $1, the cost of one orange is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits in one crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6

"To find out how many points the class is missing, we need to calculate the total points collected by Adam, Betty, Martha, and Tom.

Adam has 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more than Adam. To find 30% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.3: 50 * 0.3 = 15. Then, we add this to Adam's points: 50 + 15 = 65. So, Betty has 65 points.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom. To find 3 times Tom's points, we multiply 35 by 3: 35 * 3 = 105. So, Martha has 105 points.

Now, we add up the points of Adam, Betty, Martha, and Tom: 50 + 65 + 105 + 35 = 255.

"To find the total amount spent on snacks and drinks, we need to calculate the total number of drinks and snacks bought and then multiply it by the cost per item.

First, let's find the total number of people: Aiden and 12 friends, plus 7 more friends, equals 19 people.

Since each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks, the total number of drinks and snacks bought is 19 * 2 (drinks) + 19 * 3 (snacks) = 38 drinks + 57 snacks = 95 items.

The cost per item is $2. So, the total amount spent on snacks and drinks is 95 items * $2 = $190.

The final answer is: $190"
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the weight capacity of Gissela's truck as x. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, the weight capacity of Gordy's truck is x + 800.

We are given that the combined weight capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 800) + Gary's truck capacity = 11,600

We also know that Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, so we can substitute x = 4,000 into the equation:

4,000 + (4,000 + 800) + Gary's truck capacity = 11,600

Combine like terms:

4,000 + 4,800 + Gary's truck capacity = 11,600

Combine the constants:

8,800 + Gary's truck capacity = 11,600

Subtract 8,800 from both sides:

Gary's truck capacity = 11,600 - 8,800

Gary's truck capacity = 2,800

The final answer is: 2800"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many dumplings each male ate and then add the total number of dumplings eaten by the females. 

Since there are 6 females and each female ate 3 dumplings, the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

We know that each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

The total number of dumplings eaten is the sum of the dumplings eaten by males and females, which is 18 + 32 = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the total number of dumplings eaten, which is 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much money Gerald had initially, we need to determine the total parts in the ratio and Gerald's share. The ratio is 3:2, so the total parts are 3 + 2 = 5.

Gerald's share is 3 out of 5 parts, so we can find his initial amount by multiplying the total amount ($100) by his share (3/5).

Gerald's initial amount = $100 * (3/5) = $60

Since Gerald spent $10 on a book, we need to subtract this from his initial amount to find out how much he has left.

Gerald's remaining amount = $60 - $10 = $50

The final answer is: $50"
"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. 

Speed of the cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we need to find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We can do this by multiplying the speed of the turtle by the time.

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 3 feet/second x 40 seconds
Distance = 3 x 40
Distance = 120 feet

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we need to first determine how much they need to raise per hour to reach their goal. 

The amount they need to raise per hour can be found by dividing the total goal by the number of hours they have already raised money. 

Total goal: $6300
Amount raised in 3 hours: $2100

Amount raised per hour = Total goal - Amount raised in 3 hours
Amount raised per hour = $6300 - $2100
Amount raised per hour = $4200

Now, we can find the total number of hours they need to fundraise by dividing the total goal by the amount raised per hour.

Total hours = Total goal / Amount raised per hour
Total hours = $6300 / $4200
Total hours = 1.5

However, this is the number of hours they need to fundraise after the initial 3 hours. To find the total number of hours, we need to add the initial 3 hours.

Total hours = 1.5 + 3
Total hours = 4.5

The final answer is: 4.5"
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of water used by the city and then subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes.

The city uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. 

80% of the water used by the city is used for industrial purposes, so the percentage used for non-industrial purposes is 100% - 80% = 20%.

Since the city uses 40% of the river's water, the percentage used for non-industrial purposes is 40% * 20% = 8%.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to first calculate the total number of days in 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks would have 7 * 2 = 14 days.

Next, we need to multiply the total number of days by the daily charge of $12. 

Total charge = 14 days * $12/day = $168

The final answer is: $168"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the rate at which the factory makes chocolate and vanilla ice cream per hour. 

For chocolate ice cream, the factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours. To find the rate per hour, we divide the total quarts by the total hours: 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour.

For vanilla ice cream, the factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours. To find the rate per hour, we divide the total quarts by the total hours: 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we need to find the total quarts made in 48 hours. We multiply the rate per hour for each flavor by the total hours and add them together: (50 quarts/hour * 48 hours) + (12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours) = 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts.

The final answer is: 3000"
"To find the total bill, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the discount.

The cost of 5 croissants at $3.00 apiece is 5 x $3.00 = $15.00.
The cost of 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each is 4 x $2.50 = $10.00.
The cost of 3 mini quiches at $4.00 apiece is 3 x $4.00 = $12.00.
The cost of 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each is 13 x $1.00 = $13.00.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

Since Marcus has a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $50.00, which is 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00.

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total bill: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00.

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many scoops Erin can buy with her $6.00. Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide the total amount of money Erin has by the cost of each scoop.

$6.00 ÷ $1.50 = 4

This means Erin can buy 4 scoops of ice cream. However, the deal is buy 2 scoops get 1 free, so we need to consider this when calculating the total number of scoops Erin can get.

If Erin buys 2 scoops, she will get 1 free, so she will have 3 scoops. If she buys 4 scoops, she will get 2 free, so she will have 6 scoops. Since Erin has $6.00, she can buy 4 scoops and get 2 free, which is the best option.

Therefore, Erin should buy 4 scoops of ice cream.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total amount of candy each of them eats in two weeks and then subtract the difference from Amy's initial amount.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left, and Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

The difference in the amount of candy they have is 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total number of tiles needed, we first need to find the area of two-thirds of the bathroom. 

The area of the entire bathroom is 36 sq ft. To find two-thirds of this area, we multiply 36 by 2/3.

36 * (2/3) = 36 * 2 / 3 = 72 / 3 = 24

So, two-thirds of the bathroom is 24 sq ft. 

Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 tiles per square foot, we multiply the area of two-thirds of the bathroom by 24.

24 * 24 = 576

The final answer is: 576"
"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the cost of picking the blueberries and compare it to the cost of buying them at the store.

The cost of picking the blueberries is $20 (the cost to go picking) + $1.5 per pound * 30 pounds (the amount picked) = $20 + $45 = $65.

The cost of buying the blueberries at the store is $2.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $75.

The difference between the two costs is $75 - $65 = $10.

James saved $10 by picking the blueberries instead of buying them at the store.

The final answer is: $10"
"To find the new price of each computer, we need to calculate 10% of the original price and add it to the original price. 

Original price per computer = $700
Increase in price = 10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70
New price per computer = Original price + Increase in price = $700 + $70 = $770

Now, we can find the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices.

Total number of computers = 500
Total amount paid = New price per computer * Total number of computers = $770 * 500 = $385,000

The final answer is: $385,000"
"To find the total calories in the omelet, we need to calculate the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham.

First, let's find the total calories from the eggs: 
6 eggs * 75 calories per egg = 450 calories

Next, let's find the total calories from the cheese and ham:
2 oz of cheese * 120 calories per oz = 240 calories
2 oz of ham * 40 calories per oz = 80 calories
Total calories from cheese and ham = 240 + 80 = 320 calories

Now, let's add the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham to find the total calories in the omelet:
450 (eggs) + 320 (cheese and ham) = 770 calories

The total calories in the omelet is 770.

"To find the total number of sacks Goldy gave away, we need to add the number of sacks she gave to her cousin and her brother. 

She gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother, so the total number of sacks given away is 3 + 4 = 7 sacks.

Since each sack contains 25 kilograms of rice, we multiply the total number of sacks given away by the weight of each sack to find the total weight of rice given away.

Total weight of rice given away = 7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack = 175 kilograms.

"To find the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and two friends, we first need to find the total number of slices they ate. Since each of them ate 2/3 of their pizza, and there are 4 of them including Bryce, we can calculate the total number of slices they ate as follows:

2/3 * 4 pizzas = 8/3 pizzas

Since each pizza has 12 slices, we can convert the fraction to a decimal or multiply it by 12 to find the total number of slices they ate:

8/3 * 12 = 32 slices

Now, let's find the total number of slices eaten by the two remaining friends. They ate 3/4 of their pizzas, and there are 2 of them. We can calculate the total number of slices they ate as follows:

3/4 * 2 pizzas = 6/2 pizzas

Since each pizza has 12 slices, we can convert the fraction to a decimal or multiply it by 12 to find the total number of slices they ate:

6/2 * 12 = 36 slices

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by all friends by adding the slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends and the slices eaten by the two remaining friends:

32 slices + 36 slices = 68 slices

Since there were 16 slices in total (4 pizzas * 4 slices per pizza), we can find the number of slices left by subtracting the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:

16 slices - 68 slices = -52 slices

However, since we cannot have a negative number of slices, this means that there are not enough slices to go around. This is a problem with the question's logic. However, if we assume that the question is asking for the number of slices left after the friends ate their portions, we can say that there are -52 slices left. However, this is not a realistic answer.

"To find the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages, we need to calculate 2/3 of the time it takes the cat. 

The cat eats the sausages in 30 minutes, so the dog eats the sausages in 2/3 * 30 = 20 minutes.

Now, we need to find the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. 

To find the average, we add the time it takes for the cat and the dog and divide by 2. 

Average time = (30 + 20) / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25 minutes.

The final answer is: 25"
"To solve this problem, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

8 feet = 8 * 12 = 96 inches
Adding the 4 inches, we get:
96 + 4 = 100 inches

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches, and it is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. Then, we can write the equation:

100 = 9x + 10

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation, we get:

90 = 9x

Dividing both sides of the equation by 9, we get:

x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of windows smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed from students' cars and teachers' cars separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of windows smashed from students' cars. Since Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, we need to find a quarter of 64 cars. A quarter of 64 is 64 / 4 = 16 cars. Since each car has 4 windows, the total number of windows smashed from students' cars is 16 * 4 = 64.

Next, let's find the number of windows smashed from teachers' cars. Since Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, we need to find 3/4ths of 32 cars. 3/4ths of 32 is (3/4) * 32 = 24 cars. Since each car has 2 windows, the total number of windows smashed from teachers' cars is 24 * 2 = 48.

Now, we add the number of windows smashed from students' cars and teachers' cars to find the total number of windows smashed. 64 + 48 = 112.

The final answer is: 112"
"To find the total number of blue spools, we need to add the number of light blue and dark blue spools. 

Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

Next, we need to find the total number of spools. 

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

Now, we can find the percentage of blue spools by dividing the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00 and subtract that from the total number of people.

At 8:00, 2/5 of 5000 people had voted by midday. 
2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people voted by midday.

The remaining people at midday are 5000 - 2000 = 4000.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 
2/3 * 4000 = 2666.67 (round down to 2666 since you can't vote a fraction of a person).

The number of people who voted by 16:00 is 2000 (by midday) + 2666 = 4666.

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 5000 - 4666 = 334.

The final answer is: 334"
"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will chew in 30 days and then divide that by the number of pieces in a pack.

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. To find the total number of pieces he will chew in 30 days, we multiply the number of pieces he chews per day by 30:

4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces

Now, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces in a pack to find out how many packs he will need:

120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs

"To find out how many boxes of graham crackers are needed, we first need to calculate the total number of smores required.

9 kids want 2 smores each, so the total number of smores for kids is 9 * 2 = 18.
6 adults will eat 1 s'more each, so the total number of smores for adults is 6 * 1 = 6.
The total number of smores required is 18 (for kids) + 6 (for adults) = 24 smores.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores, we need to divide the total number of smores required by 8 to find out how many sleeves are needed: 24 / 8 = 3.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need to divide the total number of sleeves required by 3 to find out how many boxes are needed: 3 / 3 = 1.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the ages of Dora's father and mother.

Let's denote Dora's age as D, her father's age as F, and her mother's age as M.

We are given that Dora is 15 years old, so D = 15.

We are also given that Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age, so F = 2D + 8 = 2(15) + 8 = 38.

We are also given that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, so M = F - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34.

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother by adding their ages together: D + F + M = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87.

"To find the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying, we need to calculate the weight of each book and add them together.

Cindy has 2 math and science books, so the total weight of these books is 2 x 2 = 4 pounds.

Her French book weighs 4 pounds and her English book weighs 3 pounds.

Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book, so the weight of the history book is 2 x 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of all the books together: 4 (math and science) + 4 (French) + 3 (English) + 6 (history) = 17 pounds.

The total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 17 pounds.

"To find the number of votes candidate C got, we first need to find the number of votes candidate B got. 

Candidate A got 20% of the votes, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes.

Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes, so candidate B got 20 + (50% of 20) votes. 
50% of 20 is 0.5 * 20 = 10. 
So, candidate B got 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

The total number of votes is 100. Candidate A and candidate B together got 20 + 30 = 50 votes. 
So, candidate C got 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

Boris has 100 apples. 
Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. 
Boris now has 100 - 10 = 90 apples.
Beck now has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract Beck's amount from Boris's amount.

"To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract that from the total amount of water available.

For giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces/cube = 12 ounces
For medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces/cube = 14 ounces
For small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces/cube = 4 ounces

Total water used = 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces

Now, subtract the total water used from the total amount of water available: 
32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many books Steven has. Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven and Clara has 20 books, we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

where x is the number of books Steven has. To find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

So, Steven has 10 books. Since Alice has 6 more books than Steven, we can find the number of books Alice has by adding 6 to the number of books Steven has:

Alice's books = 10 + 6
Alice's books = 16

Now, we can find out how many more books Clara has than Alice by subtracting the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has:

Difference = Clara's books - Alice's books
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

"Let's break down the information given:

- Total students = 50
- Students who like to bake = 10
- Students who like to play basketball = 5

We are also given that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball. So, students who like to play music = 2 * 5 = 10

Now, let's find the total number of students who like to either bake, play basketball, or play music:
Students who like to bake + Students who like to play basketball + Students who like to play music = 10 + 5 + 10 = 25

Since the total number of students is 50, the number of students who like to play video games can be found by subtracting the number of students who like to bake, play basketball, or play music from the total number of students:
Students who like to play video games = Total students - (Students who like to bake + Students who like to play basketball + Students who like to play music)

"To find the number of boys in each class, we first need to find the total number of girls in both classes. Since 40% of the students in each class are girls, and there are 80 students in total, we can set up an equation to find the number of students in each class.

Let x be the number of students in each class. Then, 2x = 80 (since there are two classes with the same number of students).

Solving for x, we get x = 80 / 2 = 40.

Now that we know there are 40 students in each class, we can find the number of girls in each class. 40% of 40 is 0.4 * 40 = 16 girls in each class.

Since there are 40 students in each class, and 16 are girls, the number of boys in each class is 40 - 16 = 24.

"To find out how much money the vendor saves a week, we need to first calculate the daily savings and then multiply it by 7.

The vendor used to buy 500 tomatoes a day at $.5 each, so his daily cost was 500 * $.5 = $250.

With the new vendor, he buys the same 500 tomatoes at $.4 each, so his new daily cost is 500 * $.4 = $200.

The daily savings is the difference between the old cost and the new cost: $250 - $200 = $50.

To find the weekly savings, we multiply the daily savings by 7: $50 * 7 = $350.

However, the problem states that the activity requires 12 groups. To find out how many more groups are needed, we need to divide the total number of students by the new number of groups.

54 ÷ 12 = 4.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for how many more groups are needed, not the total number of groups. 

To find the number of groups needed, we can divide the total number of students by the new number of groups and subtract the result from the new number of groups.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the number of small stickers Lorraine trades for large buttons.
Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and trades 90% of them. 
90% of 30 is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.

Step 2: Calculate the number of large buttons Lorraine gets for the small stickers.
Since each small sticker is worth one small button, Lorraine gets 27 small buttons.

Step 3: Calculate the number of large buttons Lorraine gets for her large stickers.
Lorraine starts with 40 large stickers and trades 50% of them. 
50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.

Since each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, Lorraine gets 20 large buttons.

Step 4: Calculate the number of small buttons Lorraine gets for the remaining large stickers.
Since Lorraine traded 20 large stickers for large buttons, she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.
Each large sticker is worth three small stickers, so she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

Since each small sticker is worth one small button, Lorraine gets 60 small buttons.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of buttons Lorraine has.
Lorraine has 27 small buttons from trading small stickers, 20 large buttons from trading large stickers, and 60 small buttons from trading the remaining large stickers.
Total buttons = 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 buttons.

We know that the total number of people on the council is 33. Since each person can only vote either for or against the regulation, the sum of the votes in favor and against the regulation should equal 33.

So, we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms: 3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3: x = 11

"To find out how much more Jayden needs to buy the camera, we first need to calculate how much money he has after receiving the money from his sister. 

Jayden initially had $70. His sister gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. 

So, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115.

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera: $200 - $115 = $85.

Therefore, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.

$85"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as x. Since the first house needs 1/2 of the second house, the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house is x/2.

The third house needs double the first house, so the number of cases of shingles needed for the third house is 2 * (x/2) = x.

We know that the total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. We can write an equation to represent this:

x + x/2 + x = 250

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + x + 2x = 500

Combine like terms:

5x = 500

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 100

Now that we know x, we can find the number of cases of shingles needed for the third house, which is x = 100.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of each person's purchase and then add them together.

Leila buys 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so her total cost is 3 x $2 = $6.

Jack buys 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so his total cost is 5 x $1 = $5.

Chase buys 1 head of lettuce at $3, so his total cost is $3.

Now, let's add their costs together: $6 (Leila) + $5 (Jack) + $3 (Chase) = $14.

"To find the number of pears George has, we need to calculate 45% of the number of bananas and add it to the number of bananas. 

First, let's find 45% of 200 bananas:
45% of 200 = 0.45 * 200 = 90

Now, let's add 90 to the number of bananas:
200 + 90 = 290

Since George has 45% more pears than bananas, the number of pears is 290.

To find the total number of fruits, we need to add the number of bananas and pears:
200 (bananas) + 290 (pears) = 490

The final answer is: 490"
"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to subtract the cost of the ball from the amount of money Marissa had initially. 

Marissa had $80 initially and spent $20 on the ball. 

$80 (initial amount) - $20 (cost of the ball) = $60

Now, we need to find out how many candy bars Marissa can buy with $60, given that each candy bar costs $5.

$60 (remaining amount) / $5 (cost of each candy bar) = 12

So, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

12"
"To find out how much money Sam needs to spend, we first need to determine how many kilograms of oranges he needs to make 4 liters of juice. Since he needs 5 kilograms of oranges to make 1 liter, he would need 5 * 4 = 20 kilograms of oranges to make 4 liters.

Next, we need to find out the total cost of 20 kilograms of oranges. Each kilogram costs $3, so the total cost would be 20 * 3 = $60.

"To find out how much Tanya earned, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately and then add them together.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total earnings for the hours worked is 5 hours * $15/hour = $75. Additionally, she earns $5 per day for teaching more than 3 classes, so she earns $5 for Monday.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her total earnings for the hours worked is 2 hours * $15/hour = $30. Since she teaches less than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day.

Now, let's add the earnings for both days: $75 (Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) + $5 (Monday's additional day pay) = $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"To find the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

The company sold 5 vanilla scents and they have 4 vanilla scents available, so the total number of vanilla scents sold is 5 * 4 = 20 (since they have 4 different scents and each sold 5 times).

The company sold 2 fruity scents and they have 8 fruity scents available, so the total number of fruity scents sold is 2 * 8 = 16.

Now, we need to find the difference between the total number of vanilla scents sold and the total number of fruity scents sold. 

20 (vanilla scents sold) - 16 (fruity scents sold) = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Bennet makes from selling the eggplants. 

Since he sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, the total amount of money he makes from eggplants is:
20 * 3 = $60

Now, we know that Bennet wants to make a total of $135. Since he already made $60 from selling the eggplants, he needs to make $135 - $60 = $75 from selling the corn.

He has 25 ears of corn to sell, so to find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the total amount he needs to make from corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25):
$75 / 25 = $3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the percentage of Tatiana's weekend spent playing soccer, we first need to determine the total time she has available and the time she spends on other activities.

Total time available = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours

Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time
Remaining time = Total time available - Time spent reading = 12 - 3 = 9 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours

Time spent playing soccer = Total time available - Time spent reading - Time spent playing video games
= 12 - 3 - 3
= 6 hours

Now, we can find the percentage of the weekend spent playing soccer:
Percentage = (Time spent playing soccer / Total time available) * 100
= (6 / 12) * 100
= 50%

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps of the problem.

Initially, Anthony had 50 pencils.

He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon. To find out how many pencils he gave to Brandon, we multiply 50 by 1/2:
50 * 1/2 = 25

So, Anthony gave 25 pencils to Brandon. Now, he has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.

He then gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. To find out how many pencils he gave to Charlie, we multiply 25 by 3/5:
25 * 3/5 = 15

So, Anthony gave 15 pencils to Charlie. Now, he has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to drive to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and he drives at 75 mph. To find the time it takes to drive to the museum, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Since he drives back, the total time spent driving is 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours.

Adding the time spent at the museum (6 hours), the total time Jack is gone from home is:

4 hours (driving) + 6 hours (at the museum) = 10 hours

"To find the total number of wheels needed for the toys, we need to calculate the number of wheels required for the cars and the motorcycles separately and then add them together.

For the cars, Henry needs 4 wheels for each of the 57 cars, so the total number of wheels needed for the cars is:
57 * 4 = 228

For the motorcycles, Henry needs 2 wheels for each of the 73 motorcycles, so the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is:
73 * 2 = 146

Now, we add the number of wheels needed for the cars and the motorcycles to get the total number of wheels needed:
228 + 146 = 374

Since Henry has a box with 650 wheels, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the total number of wheels available to find the number of wheels left:
650 - 374 = 276

The final answer is: 276"
"To find the amount you have to pay after a 20% discount, we need to calculate 20% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

20% of $1000 = 0.20 * 1000 = $200

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:
$1000 - $200 = $800

So, you have to pay $800."
"To find the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we need to calculate the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the remaining movies.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. A third of the movies are in series, so we multiply 600 by 1/3:
600 * (1/3) = 200 movies in series

Since Mike can buy the series for $6, the cost of the series is $6.

Next, let's find the number of remaining movies. We subtract the movies in series from the total:
600 - 200 = 400 movies remaining

40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we multiply 400 by 0.4:
400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies

The cost of the older movies is $5 each, so the total cost of the older movies is:
160 * $5 = $800

The remaining movies are not in series and are not older movies, so they are normal movies. There are 400 - 160 = 240 normal movies remaining.

The cost of the normal movies is $10 each, so the total cost of the normal movies is:
240 * $10 = $2400

The total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection is the sum of the cost of the series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the normal movies:
$6 + $800 + $2400 = $3206

The final answer is: $3206"

"To find the distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the Llesis family. 

First, let's find the speed at which they hiked. They drove at an average of 50 miles per hour, and they hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. 

Half of their driving speed is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. 
5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the distance they drove. They drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour. 
Distance = Speed * Time = 50 * 6 = 300 miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour. 
Distance = Speed * Time = 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked. 
Total Distance = 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

"To find the difference between Ava and Emma's scores, we need to calculate their individual scores and then subtract Emma's score from Ava's score.

Let's denote Emma's number of enemies jumped as E, Ava's number of enemies jumped as A, Emma's number of berries collected as B, Ava's number of berries collected as a, Emma's time left as T, and Ava's time left as t.

We are given that Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so A = E + 8.
We are given that Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, so a = B + 3.

We are also given that Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so t = T - 4.

The score for each player is calculated as follows:
Emma's score = 10E + 5B + 30T
Ava's score = 10(A) + 5(a) + 30(t)

Substituting the given values, we get:
Emma's score = 10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T)
Ava's score = 10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T - 4)

Simplifying the expressions:
Emma's score = 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T
Ava's score = 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120

Combine like terms:
Emma's score = 10E + 5B + 30T + 95
Ava's score = 10E + 5B + 30T - 105

Now, we need to find the difference between their scores:
Difference = Ava's score - Emma's score
= (10E + 5B + 30T - 105) - (10E + 5B + 30T + 95)

"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to find the total cost of the two pizzas that are already known. 

The cost of the two known pizzas is 30 dollars each, so the total cost of these two pizzas is 2 x 30 = 60 dollars.

Since the total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars, we can subtract the cost of the two known pizzas to find the total cost of the other two pizzas. 

64 - 60 = 4 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can divide the total cost of these two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

4 / 2 = 2 dollars.

"To find the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on usual days and the number of times they ride on the two extra days.

On usual days, they ride thrice a day for 5 days. So, the total number of times they ride on usual days is 3 * 5 = 15.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times per day. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

Now, we add the number of times they ride on usual days and the number of times they ride on the extra days to get the total number of times they ride in a week: 15 + 12 = 27.

"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as 'w' and the number of orange fish Bob bought as 'o'. 

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying 'w' white fish and 'o' orange fish, the total number of white fish becomes 4 + w and the total number of orange fish becomes 3 + o.

Since Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

3 + o = 2(4 + w)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3 + o = 8 + 2w

Subtracting 3 from both sides:

o = 5 + 2w

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so we can set up another equation:

w + o = 17

Substituting the expression for o from the previous equation:

w + (5 + 2w) = 17

Combine like terms:

3w + 5 = 17

Subtract 5 from both sides:

3w = 12

Divide both sides by 3:

w = 4

"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total distance he travels in a week and then multiply it by the fuel efficiency and the price of gas.

First, let's calculate the total distance Andy travels in a week. Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles per day. 

The total distance traveled in a week is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Now, let's calculate the amount of fuel consumed in a week. The fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, so the amount of fuel consumed is the total distance traveled divided by the fuel efficiency: 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

Finally, let's calculate the total cost of fuel consumed in a week. The price of gas is $3/gallon, so the total cost is 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to find the total fraction of TVs that are not OLED. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4. One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8. To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 8. 

1/4 can be written as 2/8. 

Now, we can add the fractions: 2/8 + 1/8 = 3/8. 

This means that 3/8 of the TVs are either smart or analog. Since the rest are OLED, we can find the fraction of OLED TVs by subtracting 3/8 from 1 (the whole). 

1 - 3/8 can be written as 8/8 - 3/8 = 5/8. 

Now, we can find the number of OLED TVs by multiplying the fraction of OLED TVs by the total number of TVs sold: 

5/8 * 40 = (5 * 40) / 8 = 200 / 8 = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to first determine how much the school will cover. Since the school is covering half the cost of the trip, we can calculate this as:

Total cost of the trip = $300
School's contribution = Total cost / 2
School's contribution = $300 / 2
School's contribution = $150

Now, we know that John has $50 and the school is covering $150, so the total amount covered is $150 + $50 = $200.

To find out how much John is missing, we subtract the total amount covered from the total cost of the trip:

Amount John is missing = Total cost of the trip - Total amount covered
Amount John is missing = $300 - $200
Amount John is missing = $100

"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to determine the temperature at night. Since it's 33 degrees colder during the night, we subtract 33 from the daytime temperature of 45.

Nighttime temperature = 45 - 33 = 12 degrees

Since the pipes will freeze at 32 degrees, we need to find out how many degrees the temperature needs to be raised to prevent freezing. 

Temperature to be raised = 12 - 32 = -20 degrees

Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we divide the temperature to be raised by the heat per log to find out how many logs are needed.

Number of logs = -20 / 5 = -4

However, since we can't burn a negative number of logs, we need to find the absolute value of the result and round up to the nearest whole number, as Carson can't burn a fraction of a log.

Number of logs = |-4| = 4

But since the temperature is already below the freezing point, Carson needs to heat the house up to 32 degrees. So, we need to add the difference between the current temperature and the freezing point to the number of logs.

Additional logs = 32 - 12 = 20

Total logs = 4 + 20 = 24

"To find the total number of seashells brought back, we first need to find the number of groups that had members bring back seashells. 

Since 3/5 of the groups had members bring back seashells, we need to find 3/5 of the total number of groups. 

First, we need to find the total number of groups. To do this, we divide the total number of people (90) by the number of people in each group (9). 

90 / 9 = 10

Now, we know there are 10 groups in total. 

To find 3/5 of the total number of groups, we multiply 10 by 3/5.

(3/5) * 10 = (3 * 10) / 5 = 30 / 5 = 6

So, 6 groups had members bring back seashells. 

Each of these groups brought back 2 seashells. To find the total number of seashells, we multiply the number of groups by the number of seashells each group brought back.

6 * 2 = 12

200 (initial employees) + 20 (hired in the first month) + 20 (hired in the second month) + 20 (hired in the third month) = 260 employees

The total salary for each month is the number of employees multiplied by the salary per employee:
200 employees * $4000 = $800,000 per month

Since the company pays this amount for three months, the total amount paid is:

Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score, so Nikita's score is 139 + 11 = 150.

To find the total score, we add Pierson's score and Nikita's score: 278 + 150 = 428.

The final answer is: 428"
"To find the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students. There are 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class. So, the total number of students is 40 * 25 = 1000.

Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by the students is 1000.

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers. There are 40 classes with an average of 3 teachers per class. So, the total number of teachers is 40 * 3 = 120.

Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by the teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

Now, we add the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers to get the total number of trees planted. Total trees = 1000 (students) + 240 (teachers) = 1240.

The final answer is: 1240"
"To find the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. 

30% of 14 = 0.30 * 14 = 4.2

Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we'll keep the decimal value as it is because we are looking for the exact number of stuffed goats she needs to buy to achieve 30% of the total.

So, Bubbles should buy 4.2 stuffed goats."
"To find out how many hours Kris has played, we need to calculate the total hours she played in 2 weeks and 1 week.

In 2 weeks, there are 14 days. If Kris plays for half an hour every day, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in 2 weeks.

In 1 week, there are 7 days. If Kris plays for 2 hours every day, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in 1 week.

Total hours Kris has played = 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

Since Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement, she still needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between these distances.

The first car travels at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 miles/hour x 2 hours = 120 miles

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 70 miles/hour x 2 hours = 140 miles

The difference in distance between the two cars is:
Difference = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

So, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost James paid, we need to calculate the premium first. The premium is 30% of the total cost of the diamond and gold, which is $600 + $300 = $900.

The premium is 30% of $900, which is 0.3 x $900 = $270.

The total cost of the ring is the sum of the cost of the diamond and gold, plus the premium: $900 + $270 = $1170.

The final numerical answer is: $1170"
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students. 

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade:
- Third grade: 340 out of 500 passed
- Fourth grade: 40 out of 100 passed
- Fifth grade: The pass rate is twice the fourth grade's pass rate, so it's 2 * 40/100 = 80/100. Since there are 400 fifth graders, 80 out of 400 passed.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed:
340 (third grade) + 40 (fourth grade) + 80 (fifth grade) = 460

Next, let's calculate the total number of students:
500 (third grade) + 100 (fourth grade) + 400 (fifth grade) = 1000

Now, we can find the overall pass rate:
(460 / 1000) * 100 = 46%

The overall pass rate is 46%."
"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we first need to determine how many square inches of mosaic he can make with the glass chips he has. 

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, and each bag holds 72 chips, we can calculate the total number of chips Milo has: 2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips.

Now, we need to find out how many square inches of mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch, we divide the total number of chips by 12: 144 chips / 12 chips/square inch = 12 square inches.

Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, and we know the area of the mosaic (12 square inches), we can find the length of the mosaic by dividing the area by the height: 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount each group of students drank and add them together. 

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so the total amount they drank is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. 

16 students drank 2 quarts each, so the total amount they drank is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we know that 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts. 

So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party in gallons is 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to first determine how many candies he has in total. 

Dale initially ordered 100 candies and then ordered 100 more. So, the total number of candies he has is 100 + 100 = 200.

However, he has already sold 150 candies. To find out how many he still needs to sell, we subtract the number of candies sold from the total number of candies he has:

200 - 150 = 50

So, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of each month and then subtract the initial number of students (10) to find the additional students.

At the end of January, the number of students is 10 * 2 = 20.
At the end of February, the number of students is 20 * 2 = 40.
At the end of March, the number of students is 40 * 2 = 80.
At the end of April, the number of students is 80 * 2 = 160.
At the end of May, the number of students is 160 * 2 = 320.

The initial number of students is 10. To find the additional students, we subtract the initial number from the number of students at the end of May: 320 - 10 = 310.

The final answer is: 310"
"To find the total number of branches Felix climbed, we need to divide the total amount of money he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25).

Total money made = $105
Cost per branch = $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week (7 days), we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers and then subtract the petals that were dropped.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 x 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 x 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 x 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 x 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, we need to subtract 4 petals (1 from each set) from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

The final answer is: 97"
"To find out how many marshmallows are left in the bag, we need to subtract the total number of marshmallows used and the ones dropped from the initial number of marshmallows.

Initial number of marshmallows = 35
Marshmallows used by John = 9
Marshmallows used by DeSean = 9
Total marshmallows used = 9 + 9 = 18
Marshmallows dropped = 3
Total marshmallows lost = 18 + 3 = 21
Marshmallows left = 35 - 21 = 14

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the number of S'mores each kid can have is equal to the number of marshmallows left divided by 2 (since there are two kids).

Number of S'mores each kid can have = 14 / 2 = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the total time each person plays and then multiply it by the cost per minute.

Jack plays for 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. Since he can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, the number of quarters he uses is 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

One of his friends plays for half as long as Jack, so 240 / 2 = 120 minutes. Since they can play for half as long, the number of quarters they use is 120 / 20 = 6 quarters.

The other friend plays for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so 240 * 1.5 = 360 minutes. Since they can play for 1.5 times as long, the number of quarters they use is 360 / 20 = 18 quarters.

The total number of quarters used is 12 + 6 + 18 = 36 quarters.

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money used is 36 * 0.25 = $9.

The final answer is: $9"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) as x. Since Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also x.

Since she uses twice as much salt as zest, the amount of salt is 2x.

Similarly, since she uses twice as much oil as salt, the amount of oil is 2 * 2x = 4x.

The total amount of ingredients in the scrub is the sum of the amounts of oil, salt, fragrance, citrus zest, and sugar. Since she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, the amount of sugar is also 2x.

The total amount of ingredients is 4x (oil) + 2x (salt) + x (fragrance) + x (citrus zest) + 2x (sugar) = 10 ounces.

Combine like terms: 4x + 2x + x + x + 2x = 10

Combine the x terms: 9x = 10

Divide both sides by 9: x = 10/9

Since x represents the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance), and the amount of oil is 4x, we can find the amount of oil by multiplying x by 4.

The amount of oil is 4 * (10/9) = 40/9 ounces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40/9}$"
"To find the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of the goats is 3 x $500 = $1500.
The cost of the cows is 2 x $1500 = $3000.

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Total cupcakes needed = 63
Cupcakes already have = 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48

Now, subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs:
63 - 48 = 15

Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars. So, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2: 40 * 0.2 = 8. So, Joe sells 8 cars.

3. Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

4. Now, let's find out how many cars Joe has left. He started with 40 cars, sold 8, and gave away 16. So, he has 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars left.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to first determine the total amount raised by the students. Since the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, the amount raised by the students is:

$175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

Now, we know that 20 students raised this amount together. To find out how much each student raised, we divide the total amount raised by the number of students:

$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250

Each student raised $6,250."
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time, we add the time walked on both days: 8 hours + 4 hours = 12 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply the total hours by 60 to convert it to minutes: 12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes.

The final numerical answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to first find the total number of cars in the parking lot after the first break. 

Initially, there were 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars after the first break is 50 + 20 = 70.

When Hunter got out of class for the lunch break, 1/2 the number of cars in the parking lot had gone. This means that 1/2 of 70 cars left, and the remaining 1/2 stayed. 

To find the number of cars that left, we multiply 70 by 1/2: 70 * 1/2 = 35. 

Since 1/2 of the cars left, the other 1/2 stayed. So, the number of cars that stayed is also 35.

Now, to find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to find the difference between the total number of cars after the first break and the number of cars that stayed during the lunch break. 

The total number of cars after the first break is 70, and the number of cars that stayed during the lunch break is 35. 

So, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 70 - 35 = 35.

The final answer is: 35"
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 different tasks. So, the total number of tasks he completes in a day is:
30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day

Since each task pays $1.20, the total amount John makes in a day is:
150 tasks/day * $1.20/task = $180/day

John works a full 7-day week, so the total amount he makes in a week is:
$180/day * 7 days = $1260

"To find the total points Sasha scored in both games, we need to calculate her points in each game and add them together.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game. 

So, in the second game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points.

To find the total points Sasha scored in both games, we add her points from each game: 14 + 4 = 18.

"To find the total number of tins of cat food, we multiply the number of packages of cat food by the number of tins per package: 8 * 11 = 88.

To find the total number of tins of dog food, we multiply the number of packages of dog food by the number of tins per package: 6 * 6 = 36.

Now, we need to find the difference between the total number of tins of cat food and dog food: 88 - 36 = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Smendrick has:

Smendrick has 3x = 3(47) = 141 cards

And Becca has 12 more than Smendrick:

Becca has 141 + 12 = 153 cards

The final answer is: 153"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs and then add them together.

Cindy had 5 green eggs.

She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.

She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had (1/3) * 9 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up the total number of eggs: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and subtract the refund amount from the purchase price.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost:

Shipping cost per pound: $0.35
Number of pounds: 4
Shipping cost = 4 * $0.35 = $1.40

Shipping cost per mile: $0.08
Number of miles: 20
Shipping cost = 20 * $0.08 = $1.60

Total shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60 = $2.00

Now, let's calculate the refund amount:
Refund percentage: 75%
Purchase price: $32
Refund amount = 0.75 * $32 = $24

Now, let's calculate the total amount Milly will lose:
Total shipping cost: $2.00
Refund amount: $24
Loss = Total shipping cost - Refund amount
Loss = $2.00 - $24 = -$22.00

However, since we can't lose a negative amount of money, we need to recalculate the loss by considering the refund amount as the maximum amount Milly can get back. 

Loss = Total shipping cost - Refund amount
Loss = $2.00 - $24 = -$22.00
Since the loss can't be negative, we'll consider the refund as the maximum amount Milly can get back. 
Loss = Total shipping cost
Loss = $2.00

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she spent and subtract it from the initial amount she had.

First, let's calculate the total amount she spent:

- Two pairs of jeans at $30 each: 2 x $30 = $60
- A bag for $20: $20
- Total spent: $60 + $20 = $80

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount Mulan had:

Initial amount: $40
Total spent: $80
Amount left: $40 - $80 = -$40

However, since we can't have a negative amount of money, this means Mulan doesn't have enough money to buy the items. She is short $40.

But if we assume she bought the items anyway, we can say she has -$40 left, but in reality, she would need to borrow or find more money to cover the remaining amount.

If we ignore the negative aspect and just focus on the calculation, the amount left would be -$40."
"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for the first three weeks and then determine the pattern.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, we can find the production for the fourth week by subtracting the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

The final answer is: 14,000"
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on TikTok in a week and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the time she spends on TikTok in a week:

1. Time spent recording videos: 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes
2. Time spent writing amateur songs: 2 hours = 120 minutes
3. Time spent doing makeup: 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes

Total time spent on TikTok in a week = 72 minutes + 120 minutes + 90 minutes = 282 minutes

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly time by 4:

Total time spent on TikTok in a month = 282 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1128 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

1128 minutes / 60 = 18.8 hours

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. The cost of the initial installation is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. However, the initial installation already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier. So, we need to subtract these from the total number of items she has:

- Mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2
- Chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1
- Pictures: 20 - 10 = 10

The number of additional items is 2 mirrors, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. The cost of the additional items is $15.00 per item, so the total cost of the additional items is:

2 (mirrors) * $15.00 = $30.00
1 (chandelier) * $15.00 = $15.00
10 (pictures) * $15.00 = $150.00

The total cost of the additional items is $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00.

The total cost is the sum of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00

The final answer is: $324.00"
"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to first determine how much money Anthony has. Since Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20.00, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

Anthony's savings = Eva's savings + $10.00
Anthony's savings = $20.00 + $10.00
Anthony's savings = $30.00

Now that we know Anthony's savings, we can find out how much money Roy has. Since Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, we can calculate Roy's savings as follows:

Let's assume Anthony's savings is 100%. Then, Roy's savings will be 140% of Anthony's savings (100% + 40% more).
Roy's savings = 1.4 * Anthony's savings
Roy's savings = 1.4 * $30.00
Roy's savings = $42.00

"To solve this problem, we need to find the ratio of Naruto's lifting ability to Pompei's lifting ability. 

First, we know that Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can. Since Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches.

Next, we know that Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay can. So, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Then, we know that Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami can. So, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). 

480 / 12 = 40 feet.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the time it takes for one kangaroo to travel across the highway. Since three kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, one kangaroo would take three times as long, which is 18 * 3 = 54 hours.

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, it will take them twice as long to travel the same distance. Therefore, if one kangaroo takes 54 hours, four turtles will take 54 * 2 = 108 hours.

The final answer is: 108"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many dishes Jada and Rory made. 

Since Kora made 20 dishes, and Rory made 20 more than Kora, Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.

Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, we need to add up the number of dishes made by all three: Kora (20), Rory (40), and Jada (80).

20 + 40 + 80 = 140

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has after receiving her payment and her mom's contribution.

First, let's calculate the price of the new laptop after trading in her old one: 
$600 - $200 = $400

Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom gave her $80, so she has a total of:
$150 + $80 = $230

Since she only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, we can set up an equation to find out how much money she has in her purse:
Let x be the amount of money in her purse.
x + $230 = $400 + $50

Now, let's solve for x:
x = $400 + $50 - $230

So, Erika has $220 in her purse."
"To find the total number of apple slices, we first need to calculate the total number of slices from the large and small apples.

3 large apples can be sliced into 3 x 5 = 15 slices.
5 small apples can be sliced into 5 x 3 = 15 slices.

Total number of slices = 15 (from large apples) + 15 (from small apples) = 30 slices.

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
30 (total slices) - 15 (eaten slices) = 15 slices.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the total amount of milk the farmer currently gets from his 3 cows. 

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the total amount of milk from 3 cows is 3 * 5 = 15 liters.

Now, we need to find out how many more cows are needed to produce 25 liters of milk a day. We can do this by subtracting the current total from the desired total: 25 - 15 = 10 liters.

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we need to divide the remaining amount by the amount each cow produces: 10 / 5 = 2.

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and add them together.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, which is 1/6 of 12 millimeters. To find this, we multiply 12 by 1/6:
12 * (1/6) = 12/6 = 2 millimeters

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, which is 2/3 of 12 millimeters. To find this, we multiply 12 by 2/3:
12 * (2/3) = 24/3 = 8 millimeters

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, which is 1/2 of 12 millimeters. To find this, we multiply 12 by 1/2:
12 * (1/2) = 12/2 = 6 millimeters

Now, we add the unused portions of the glue sticks together:
2 + 8 + 6 = 16 millimeters

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total amount he has and subtract it from the total cost of the items he wants to buy.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200, so he has a total of $5000 + $200 = $5200.

The total cost of the items he wants to buy is $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10800.

To find out how much money he still needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost: $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

The final answer is: $5600"
"To find the change, we need to subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount Thea gave the craftsman. 

First, let's calculate the total amount Thea gave the craftsman: 4 * $20 = $80.

"To find out how much money Craig has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from the initial amount he had.

Craig has 2 twenty-dollar bills, which is 2 x $20 = $40.

He buys 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so the total cost of the squirt guns is 6 x $2 = $12.

He also buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so the total cost of the water balloons is 3 x $3 = $9.

The total amount he spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount he had: $40 - $21 = $19.

Craig has $19 left.

The final answer is: $19"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so the number of socks Jack has is 60 / 2 = 30.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 2 * 30 = 60 socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90
Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 90 + 90 = 180."
"To find the number of students good at math, we need to consider the total number of students and the number of students good at both subjects. 

Let's denote the number of students good at both math and English as x. We know that the total number of students is 20, and the number of students good at math only is 5, and the number of students good at English only is 8.

We can set up the equation: 5 (math only) + 8 (English only) + x (both) = 20 (total)

Simplifying the equation, we get: 13 + x = 20

Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get: x = 7

This means that 7 students are good at both math and English. To find the total number of students good at math, we need to add the number of students good at math only (5) and the number of students good at both subjects (7).

Total number of students good at math = 5 (math only) + 7 (both) = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total time available for performances, we need to subtract the intermission time from the total concert time. 

Total concert time = 2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes
Intermission time = 10 minutes
Time available for performances = Total concert time - Intermission time = 120 - 10 = 110 minutes

Each group takes 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes to perform and exit. 

Number of groups that can perform = Time available for performances / Time per group = 110 / 10 = 11

"To solve this problem, we need to understand that the interest rate is not a fixed percentage, but rather a fraction of the original amount. The interest rate is 3/4 of the original amount, which is equivalent to 0.75 times the original amount.

The formula for simple interest is:

A = P(1 + rt)

Where:
A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest
P = principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)
r = annual interest rate (in decimal form)
t = time the money is invested or borrowed for, in years

However, in this case, the interest rate is not a fixed percentage, but rather a fraction of the original amount. So, we need to adjust the formula accordingly.

The interest earned each year is 3/4 of the original amount, which is $300. So, the interest earned each year is:

Year 1: $300 * 3/4 = $225
Year 2: $300 + $225 = $525 * 3/4 = $393.75
Year 3: $525 + $393.75 = $918.75 * 3/4 = $688.0625

The total amount after 3 years is the sum of the principal and the interest earned each year:

$300 + $225 + $393.75 + $688.0625 = $1306.8125

The final answer is: $1306.81"
"To find the number of white shirts with no collars, we need to find the number of white shirts that have collars and subtract it from the total number of white shirts. Since half of the white shirts have collars, the number of white shirts with collars is 40 / 2 = 20. 

The number of white shirts with no collars is 40 - 20 = 20.

To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we need to find the number of floral shirts that have buttons and subtract it from the total number of floral shirts. The number of floral shirts with buttons is 20.

The number of floral shirts with no buttons is 50 - 20 = 30.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars. 

The difference is 30 - 20 = 10.

"To find out how much the farmer will earn, we need to determine how many trays he can fill with 900 eggs. 

Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray to find the number of trays:

900 eggs / 30 eggs per tray = 30 trays

Now, we can multiply the number of trays by the price per tray to find the total earnings:

30 trays * $2.5 per tray = $75

"To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we need to first determine the number of goats sold from each farm and then subtract that from the initial number of goats in each farm.

From Farm X, Mr. Smith sold 10 goats. 
From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as from Farm X, which is 2 * 10 = 20 goats.

Now, let's calculate the number of goats left in each farm:
- Farm X: 55 - 10 = 45 goats
- Farm Y: 45 - 20 = 25 goats

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the number of goats left in each farm:
45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70 goats

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount spent on shoes per year by the number of pairs bought per year.

First, let's calculate the number of pairs James buys per year: 2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

Now, let's divide the total amount spent per year by the number of pairs bought per year: $2640/year ÷ 24 pairs/year = $110/pair

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food, then subtract the discount for the red food.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 x $25 = $75.

The cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 x $18 = $54.

The total cost before discount is $75 + $54 = $129.

Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, the total discount is 3 x $2 = $6.

The total cost after discount is $129 - $6 = $123.

The final numerical answer is: $123"
"To find the time it takes to clean one-half of the rooms, we first need to determine the number of rooms that is half of 90. 

90 / 2 = 45 rooms

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room.

45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built each year and then add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years, which is 12 + 36 = 48 homes. Then, they will double this amount, so 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's add the number of homes built each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes.

The total number of homes built over the next three years is 144.

"Let's denote my age as 'x'. Since I am three years younger than my brother, my brother's age is x + 3. My sister is 2 years younger than me, so her age is x - 2.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, which can be expressed as 3(x + 3) - 1.

The sum of all our ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 10 + 3x - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms again: 8x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 8x = 78.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 9.75.

Since age cannot be a fraction, we need to find the closest integer that satisfies the equation. However, in this case, we can see that x = 9.75 is not a valid solution because it doesn't fit the given conditions. We need to re-examine the equation.

Let's re-examine the equation: 8x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 8x = 78.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 9.75.

Since x = 9.75 is not a valid solution, let's try to find the closest integer that satisfies the equation. We can try x = 9 or x = 10.

If x = 9, then my brother's age is 9 + 3 = 12, my sister's age is 9 - 2 = 7, and my mom's age is 3(12) - 1 = 35. The sum of our ages is 9 + 12 + 7 + 35 = 63, which is less than 87.

If x = 10, then my brother's age is 10 + 3 = 13, my sister's age is 10 - 2 = 8, and my mom's age is 3(13) - 1 = 38. The sum of our ages is 10 + 13 + 8 + 38 = 69, which is still less than 87.

Let's try x = 11. If x = 11, then my brother's age is 11 + 3 = 14, my sister's age is 11 - 2 = 9, and my mom's age is 3(14) - 1 = 41. The sum of our ages is 11 + 14 + 9 + 41 = 75, which is still less than 87.

Let's try x = 12. If x = 12, then my brother's age is 12 + 3 = 15, my sister's age is 12 - 2 = 10, and my mom's age is 3(15) - 1 = 44. The sum of our ages is 12 + 15 + 10 + 44 = 81, which is still less than 87.

Let's try x = 13. If x = 13, then my brother's age is 13 + 3 = 16, my sister's age is 13 - 2 = 11, and my mom's age is 3(16) - 1 = 47. The sum of our ages is 13 + 16 + 11 + 47 = 87.

Therefore, I am 13 years old."
"To find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs, we need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required and then divide that by the number of glue sticks per pack.

First, let's find the total number of glue sticks needed: 
27 students * 2 glue sticks per student = 54 glue sticks

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks by 8 to find out how many packs are needed:
54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks per pack = 6.75 packs

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure every student gets 2 glue sticks. 

6.75 packs → 7 packs

So, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks to have some extra glue sticks left over.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at the given point over the three days.

On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point over the three days, we need to add the amounts of water passing through the river each day:

Total amount of water = 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000 gallons.

The final answer is: 24000"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. The number of people infected each day is six times the number of people infected the previous day, starting with 10 people on the first day.

Day 1: 10 people (initially infected)
Day 2: 10 * 6 = 60 people
Day 3: 60 * 6 = 360 people

However, this is not the total number of people infected after three days. We also need to include the initial 10 people who were infected on the first day. 

Total number of people infected after three days = 360 (infected on Day 3) + 60 (infected on Day 2) + 10 (infected on Day 1) = 430

The final answer is: 430"
"To find out how much money Julieta received, we need to calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips and subtract it from Rafaela's total tips. 

Rafaela received 40 * $20 = $800 in tips.

10% of $800 is 0.1 * $800 = $80.

So, Julieta received $800 - $80 = $720 in tips.

The total amount of money both received is $800 + $720 = $1520.

"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to first calculate the total number of oranges given to her children.

Jennifer gave her 3 daughters 2 oranges each, so the total number of oranges given to her daughters is 3 x 2 = 6 oranges.

She also gave her son 3 oranges.

In total, Jennifer gave away 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Since Jennifer bought 12 oranges initially, we subtract the number of oranges given away from the total to find out how many she remained with: 12 - 9 = 3 oranges.

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Claire earns 1 badge per month.
- Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.
- Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), the number of badges earned by each person would be:

- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 0.5 badges/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:

36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

"To find out how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices she baked and sold, and then multiply that by the price per slice.

First, let's find out how many hours she baked. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours.

Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, and each loaf is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices she baked per hour is 2 * 8 = 16 slices.

In 5 hours, she baked 16 * 5 = 80 slices.

Since each slice is sold for 50 cents, the total amount she raised is 80 * 0.5 = 40 dollars.

"To find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we need to determine the number of silver coins first. 

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, and Gretchen has 70 gold coins, we can set up an equation to represent the relationship between the number of gold and silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. 

The equation would be: x + (x + 30) = 70 (since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins)

Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 70

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20

So, Gretchen has 20 silver coins. 

Now, to find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and silver coins: 70 (gold coins) + 20 (silver coins) = 90

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we first need to determine the total number of burritos given to the students. 

There were 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Mr. George ate 20 burritos. 

The total number of burritos ordered was 600. 

To find the total number of leftover burritos, we subtract the number of burritos given to the students and the number eaten by Mr. George from the total number of burritos ordered. 

So, the total number of leftover burritos is 600 - (500 + 20) = 600 - 520 = 80.

"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first determine the number of green and blue cars. 

Let's start with the number of green cars. We are told that there are 2 fewer green cars than red cars. Since there are 12 red cars, the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

Next, we are told that there are 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars. Since there are 10 green cars, the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we know the total number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52.

Since the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23.

"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S.

We are given that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so we can write an equation: S = A + 25.

We are also given that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so we can write another equation: A = F - 12.

We are also given that together, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books, so we can write a third equation: S + A + F = 85.

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the third equation to get: (A + 25) + A + F = 85.

Combine like terms: 2A + 25 + F = 85.

Subtract 25 from both sides: 2A + F = 60.

Now, substitute the second equation into this one: 2(F - 12) + F = 60.

Expand the equation: 2F - 24 + F = 60.

Combine like terms: 3F - 24 = 60.

Add 24 to both sides: 3F = 84.

Divide both sides by 3: F = 28.

"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he ate on each day and add them together.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and divide by 5:
(2/5) * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, on the first day, he ate 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. To find the remaining pieces after the first two days, we subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26

Now, we need to find 7/13 of 26:
(7/13) * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14

So, on the third day, he ate 14 pieces.

Now, we add the pieces eaten on each day to find the total:

"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we first need to find the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water.

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so the cost of one bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

The cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the cost of one bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, we can find the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
3 bottles of soda = 3 x $3.00 = $9.00
2 bottles of water = 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

The cost of each bolt is $0.03, and David wants to buy 16 bolts. 

Total cost of bolts = Number of bolts * Cost per bolt
Total cost of bolts = 16 * $0.03
Total cost of bolts = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost of the bolts from the initial amount of money David has:

Initial amount of money = $12.48
Total cost of bolts = $0.48
Money left = Initial amount of money - Total cost of bolts
Money left = $12.48 - $0.48
Money left = $12.00

Now, Paul has 80 marbles. He lost 1/4 of his marbles. To find 1/4 of 80, we multiply 80 by 1/4 or divide 80 by 4:

80 / 4 = 20

So, Paul lost 20 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has left, we subtract 20 from 80:

80 - 20 = 60

Therefore, Paul has 60 marbles left.

"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points she scores on each type of question and then add them together.

For multiple-choice questions: 
Amy correctly answers 80% of 10 questions, so she answers 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions correctly. 
Since each question is worth 1 point, she scores 8 points on multiple-choice questions.

For true/false questions: 
Amy correctly answers 90% of 20 questions, so she answers 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions correctly. 
Since each question is worth 1 point, she scores 18 points on true/false questions.

For long-answer questions: 
Amy correctly answers 60% of 5 questions, so she answers 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions correctly. 
Since each question is worth 5 points, she scores 3 * 5 = 15 points on long-answer questions.

Now, we add the points from each type of question to find Amy's total score: 
8 (multiple-choice) + 18 (true/false) + 15 (long-answer) = 41 points.

The final answer is: 41"
"To find out how much money Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000, we first need to determine how much money he will make from selling the chickens. Since he plans to sell 3/5 of the 300 chickens at $50 per chicken, we can calculate the total amount of money he will make from selling the chickens.

First, let's find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell: 
3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he will make from selling the chickens:
180 chickens * $50 per chicken = $9000

Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, we can set up an equation to find out how much he spent on the chickens:
Cost of chickens + Profit = Total amount of money from selling the chickens
Let's denote the cost of the chickens as 'x'. Then the equation becomes:
x + 2000 = 9000

Now, let's solve for 'x':
x = 9000 - 2000
x = 7000

So, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for $7000."
"To find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 2, since they sold an equal number. 

Total glasses sold = 32
Number of people who sold an equal number of glasses = 2 (Micah and Mitchell)
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = Total glasses sold / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16

Since Julie sold 14 glasses, we can find out how many more glasses she sold than Micah by subtracting the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold.

Glasses sold by Julie = 14
Glasses sold by Micah = 16
Difference = Glasses sold by Julie - Glasses sold by Micah = 14 - 16 = -2

The final answer is: $\boxed{-2}$"
"To find the total amount Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them together.

The cost of the hair service is $400.

The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the cost of the hair service, which is (1/4) * 400 = $100.

The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the cost of the manicure, which is (3/4) * 100 = $75.

Now, we add the costs of all three services together: 400 + 100 + 75 = $575.

The final answer is: $575"
"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope, we need to calculate the total amount of money she gets from selling the old rope and then subtract the cost of the new rope.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Sarah gets from selling the old rope:

Length of the old rope = 20 meters
Price per meter = $2
Total amount of money = Length of the old rope * Price per meter
Total amount of money = 20 * 2
Total amount of money = 40

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new rope:

Length of the new rope = ? (we don't know this yet, but we'll call it x)
Price per meter = $1.5
Cost of the new rope = Length of the new rope * Price per meter
Cost of the new rope = x * 1.5

Since Sarah plans to use the profit to buy the new rope, we can set up an equation:

Total amount of money - Cost of the new rope = Profit
40 - (x * 1.5) = Profit

However, we don't know the length of the new rope (x). To find the profit, we need more information. But let's assume Sarah buys a rope of the same length as the old one (20 meters) to see what happens:

Cost of the new rope = 20 * 1.5
Cost of the new rope = 30

Now, let's calculate the profit:

Profit = Total amount of money - Cost of the new rope
Profit = 40 - 30
Profit = 10

So, if Sarah buys a new rope of the same length as the old one, she will have $10 left over.

The final answer is: $10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Melanie's current age be x. 

In 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. This means that her current age plus 10 years is equal to 18. We can write this as an equation:

x + 10 = 18

To find Melanie's current age, we need to solve for x. We can do this by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:

x = 18 - 10
x = 8

So, Melanie's current age is 8 years.

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let's call this number y. We can write this as an equation:

8 + y = 3(8)

To solve for y, we can start by multiplying 3 and 8:

8 + y = 24

Next, we can subtract 8 from both sides of the equation to isolate y:

y = 24 - 8
y = 16

However, this is the number of years after which her age will be thrice her present age. To find the total number of years, we need to add 10 (the number of years that have already passed) to y:

Total years = y + 10
Total years = 16 + 10
Total years = 26

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's find the cost of the bacon: 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total.

Next, we need to find the cost of the chicken. Each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each pack of chicken costs $10 / 5 = $2. Since Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost of the chicken is 6 * $2 = $12.

The cost of the strawberries is 3 packs * $4 = $12.

The cost of the apples is 7 packs * $2 (since each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2) = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items: $10 (bacon) + $12 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $48.

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $48 = $17.

The final answer is: $17"
"Let's denote the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts as 'x' minutes. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, its runtime is 2x minutes. 

The final concert's runtime is 65 minutes, which includes the encore. So, we can set up the equation: 2x + 15 = 65.

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50

Now, divide both sides by 2 to find the value of x: x = 50 / 2
x = 25

"To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he had initially.

Argo initially had 200 toys. He gave away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. 

First, let's add up the number of toys he gave away: 40 + 80 + 30 = 150

Now, let's subtract the total number of toys given away from the initial number of toys: 200 - 150 = 50

So, Argo has 50 toys now.

On Friday, they make twice as many as Wednesday, which is 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, let's add the number of chimichangas made on each day:
125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) + 250 (Friday) = 400

"To find the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged, we first need to find the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs. 

Let's assume the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is x. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is 2x.

However, we know that 20% of the total 50 microphones won't find any space to fit in. This means that 80% of the microphones will be arranged in pairs. 

We can set up the equation: 80% of 50 = 2x

To find 80% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.8: 
50 * 0.8 = 40

Now we have the equation: 40 = 2x

To find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
x = 40 / 2
x = 20

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate the number of birds in each group and add them together.

First, let's find the number of birds nesting in the bushes: 6

Next, let's find the number of birds flying overhead. Since 2/3 of the birds in the bushes are flying overhead, we multiply 6 by 2/3:
6 * (2/3) = 4

Now, let's find the number of birds feeding. There are 3 groups of 8 birds each, so we multiply 3 by 8:
3 * 8 = 24

Now, let's add the number of birds in each group together:
6 + 4 + 24 = 34

"To find the total number of petals on the orchids, we multiply the number of orchids by the number of petals per orchid: 5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals.

To find the total number of petals on the daisies, we multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals.

Now, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies to find the difference: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

The daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids.

"To find the percentage of flowering plants, we first need to find the number of flowering plants. 

There are 100 plants in total. One-fourth of them are indoor plants, which is 100 * (1/4) = 25 plants. 

The remaining plants are 100 - 25 = 75 plants. Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants, which is 75 * (2/3) = 50 plants. 

The rest of the remaining plants are flowering plants, which is 75 - 50 = 25 plants.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25/100) * 100 = 25%.

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can set up the equation:

Speed of whatchamacallit = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
121 = 11 * Speed of thingamabob

To find the speed of the thingamabob, we can divide both sides of the equation by 11:

Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which is five times the speed of the thingamabob:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55

"Let's break down the information given:

- Ellen eats 2 carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day.
- The salad costs $6.
- The yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.
- The total cost of Ellen's daily goods is $11.

Let's denote the cost of one carrot as 'c'. Since Ellen eats 2 carrots every day, the total cost of carrots is 2c.

The total cost of Ellen's daily goods can be represented as the sum of the cost of carrots, the salad, and the yogurt: 2c + 6 + 3 = 11.

Combine like terms: 2c + 9 = 11.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 2c = 2.

Divide both sides by 2: c = 1.

The cost of one carrot is $1.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn. Let's denote the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of lawns she mowed is the sum of the lawns she mowed each week, which is 3x + x + 5x = 9x.

We know that she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, and since she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times, she made a total of $6x from mowing lawns.

We also know that she made $80 in total from both lemonade sales and mowing lawns. So, we can set up the equation:

6x + (80 - 6x) = 80

Simplifying the equation, we get:

80 - 6x + 6x = 80
80 = 80

However, this equation doesn't make sense, as it's always true. We need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-evaluate the problem: If she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, and she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times as many times as Joe's, she made 3 * $6 = $18 from mowing Kamala's lawn. 

The total amount she made from mowing lawns is $6 + $18 = $24.

Since she made a total of $80, the amount she made from lemonade sales is $80 - $24 = $56.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Let's denote the number of notebooks Martha initially had as 'x'. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, the number of notebooks Joseph had is 3x.

We know that Martha bought 5 more notebooks and now has a total of 7 notebooks. This can be represented as x + 5 = 7.

To find the value of x, we can solve the equation x + 5 = 7. Subtracting 5 from both sides gives us x = 2.

Now that we know Martha initially had 2 notebooks, we can find the number of notebooks Joseph had, which is 3x = 3(2) = 6.

To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has: 7 - 6 = 1.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more than as many pages as Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 5 + 13 = 18 pages today.

So, Denise's total pages read is 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.

Daniel's total pages read is 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages.

The difference between Denise's and Daniel's total pages read is 28 - 13 = 15.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of bowls that can be filled with the soup and then divide that by the number of child's bowls.

Since the pot can fill 4 adult's bowls or 8 child's bowls, we can assume that the capacity of the pot is equivalent to 8 child's bowls.

The family consists of 3 adults and 2 children, and each person eats one bowl at a meal. So, the total number of bowls used for dinner is 3 (adults) + 2 (children) = 5 bowls.

Since the pot can fill 8 child's bowls, and 5 bowls were used for dinner, there are 8 - 5 = 3 bowls left.

Each child will get one bowl for lunch, so the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup is 3 / 2 = 1.5.

However, since you can't have a fraction of a bowl, we can say that each child will get one bowl for lunch, and there will be one bowl left over.

"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to calculate the total amount of material required for small and large masks separately and then add them together.

For small masks: 
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. 
- To find out how much material is needed for 1 small mask, we divide 2 yards by 4 masks: 2 yards / 4 masks = 0.5 yards per small mask.
- To find out how much material is needed for 20 small masks, we multiply 0.5 yards per small mask by 20 masks: 0.5 yards/mask * 20 masks = 10 yards.

For large masks: 
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. 
- To find out how much material is needed for 1 large mask, we divide 2.25 yards by 3 masks: 2.25 yards / 3 masks = 0.75 yards per large mask.
- To find out how much material is needed for 8 large masks, we multiply 0.75 yards per large mask by 8 masks: 0.75 yards/mask * 8 masks = 6 yards.

Now, we add the material needed for small and large masks together: 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write an equation:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 2 * Adam's age four years ago
Duncan's age eight years ago = 2x

We know that Duncan's current age is 60, so we can find his age eight years ago by subtracting 8 from 60:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 60 - 8
Duncan's age eight years ago = 52

Now we can equate this to 2x:

52 = 2x

To find x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 52 / 2
x = 26

This means Adam's age four years ago was 26. To find Adam's current age, we add 4 to x:

Adam's current age = x + 4
Adam's current age = 26 + 4
Adam's current age = 30

Finally, to find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = Adam's current age + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 38

"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the time it takes to solve the extreme sudoku and then divide it by the time it takes to drink one bottle of water.

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so the time to solve an extreme sudoku is 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to convert the time to solve the extreme sudoku to hours and then divide by 0.5 (since there are 2 half hours in an hour). 

180 minutes is equal to 3 hours (180 / 60 = 3). 

Now, we divide 3 hours by 0.5 to get the number of half hours, which is 6. 

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, he drinks 6 bottles of water in 3 hours.

This equation represents the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red and yellow balloons. We know that there are 20 red balloons, so we multiply 2 by 20 to get the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons. We multiply 3 by the number of yellow balloons (y) to get the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons.

Now, we can solve for y:

2 * 20 + 3 * y = 58
40 + 3y = 58

Subtract 40 from both sides:

3y = 18

Divide both sides by 3:

y = 6

So, there are 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in 30 days. 

Since Jon drives 100 miles a day, the total miles driven in 30 days is:
100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs:
3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total hours Bruce works, we need to calculate the hours he works each day and add them up.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours he works each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of money Julia and Nadine had, and then divide it by 2 to find out how much each of them received as allowance.

First, let's calculate the cost of the balloons. 1 dozen balloons is equal to 12 balloons. Since 2 balloons cost $0.5, we can find the cost of 1 balloon by dividing $0.5 by 2, which is $0.25. Now, we can multiply the cost of 1 balloon by 12 to find the total cost of the balloons: 12 * $0.25 = $3.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the items they bought: cake ($11) + balloons ($3) + 2 tubs of ice cream ($7 * 2 = $14). The total cost is $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since they used the remaining money to buy these items, the total amount of money they had is equal to the total cost of the items. Let's call the amount of money each girl received as allowance 'x'. Since they combined their allowance, the total amount of money they had is 2x.

Now, we can set up an equation: 2x = $28. To find the value of x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = $28 / 2 = $14.

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14 as allowance.

The final answer is: $14"
"To find the total number of fruits Kira bought, we need to add the number of apples, bananas, and oranges. 

Total fruits = 3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14

Since Lola ate 2 pieces of the fruit, we need to subtract 2 from the total number of fruits.

Fruits left = Total fruits - Fruits eaten = 14 - 2 = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer, and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of students playing tennis. There are 6 students playing tennis, and twice that number playing volleyball, so the number of students playing volleyball is 6 * 2 = 12.

Now, let's add the number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer. 
Number of students playing tennis: 6
Number of students playing volleyball: 12
Number of students playing soccer: 16 (boys) + 22 (girls) = 38
Total number of students = 6 + 12 + 38 = 56

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's find the total number of lollipops sold by the class. Since each student sold 10 lollipops and there are 30 students, the total number of lollipops sold is:
30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops

The total revenue is the total number of lollipops sold multiplied by the selling price of each lollipop:
300 lollipops * $0.8/lollipop = $240

The total cost is the total number of lollipops bought multiplied by the cost of each lollipop:
300 lollipops * $0.5/lollipop = $150

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $240 - $150
Profit = $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

$90"
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and add them up.

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the number of each type of pet: 
3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47

The final answer is: 47"
"To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to determine the total number of slices both Abby and Josh can eat per day.

Abby eats 2 slices per day. 
Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 * 2 = 4 slices per day.

Together, they eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices per day.

To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat per day: 24 / 6 = 4.

The loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"To find out how many shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and we want to know the total by her 10th birthday, we need to count the months from her 5th birthday to her 10th birthday.

There are 12 months in a year. From her 5th birthday to her 10th birthday, Martha has been collecting shells for 5 years. 

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects one shell per month, we multiply the total number of months by 1 shell/month.

60 months * 1 shell/month = 60 shells

Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

60"
"To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we first need to determine the total number of cups of chamomile and mint tea in each row. 

Since Lana divides the 27 cups into 3 rows, we can find the number of cups in each row by dividing 27 by 3. 

27 / 3 = 9 cups in each row.

Since she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is half of the total cups in each row.

9 / 2 = 4.5 cups of mint tea in each row.

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a cup, we can assume that Lana will make whole cups of tea. Therefore, she will make 4 cups of mint tea in each row and 5 cups of chamomile tea in each row.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip. 

Let's break down the problem:

- The sloth has 8 hours to collect 24 berries.
- Each trip down, up, and back takes 4 hours, so the sloth can make 8 / 4 = 2 trips in 8 hours.
- Since the sloth picks the same number of berries on each trip, let's call the number of berries picked per trip 'x'.
- The total number of berries picked in 2 trips is 2x.
- We want to find the minimum value of 'x' such that 2x = 24.

To find the minimum value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

2x = 24
x = 24 / 2
x = 12

So, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the amount of water in the tank after 6 days, we first need to determine the initial amount of water in the tank. Since Anthony and his father fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool, we can calculate this as follows:

Initial water in the pool = 10000 gallons
Water in the tank = 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons

Next, we need to find out how much water is used from the tank in 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so we can calculate the total water used as follows:

Water used in 6 days = 500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons

Now, we can find the remaining water in the tank by subtracting the water used from the initial amount in the tank:

Remaining water in the tank = Initial water in the tank - Water used in 6 days
= 5000 gallons - 3000 gallons
= 2000 gallons

The final answer is: 2000"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much money Colby has left and then determine how many movies he can see with the remaining money.

Colby's initial budget is $150. He has already spent money on:

- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Colby has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Since Colby wants to buy a popcorn and a box of candy, he will spend $8 + $2 = $10.

Colby has $20 - $10 = $10 left.

Tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10. Colby can see 1 more movie with the remaining $10.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we first need to find the calories of a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin. 

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 * 1/3 = 200 calories. 

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 * 1/3 = 150 calories.

Now, we can find the total calories of the mini cinnamon rolls: 200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories = 40000 calories.

Next, we can find the total calories of the mini blueberry muffins: 300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories = 45000 calories.

Finally, we can find the total calories of all the pastries: 40000 calories + 45000 calories = 85000 calories.

On Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Tuesday, so 2 * 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378

There are 5 days in total. 

Average number of Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days

"To find out how far each vehicle traveled, we need to multiply their speeds by the time they traveled.

The bus traveled 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it traveled is 60 * 5 = 300 miles.

The car traveled 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is 30 * 8 = 240 miles.

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled: 300 - 240 = 60 miles.

"Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as p, and John's age as j. 

We are given that Paul is 10 years older than John, so we can write an equation: p = j + 10.

We are also given that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, so we can write another equation: P = p + j.

We are also given that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years old, so we can write a third equation: P + p + j = 100.

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to get: P = (j + 10) + j.

Simplifying the equation, we get: P = 2j + 10.

Now we can substitute the expression for P into the third equation: (2j + 10) + (j + 10) + j = 100.

Combine like terms: 4j + 20 = 100.

Subtract 20 from both sides: 4j = 80.

Divide both sides by 4: j = 20.

Now that we know John's age, we can find Paul's age using the first equation: p = j + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30.

Now that we know Paul's age, we can find Peter's age using the second equation: P = p + j = 30 + 20 = 50.

"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria had 1 balloon, and each of her 4 friends had 2 balloons. So, the total number of balloons initially is:
1 (Maria's balloon) + 4 * 2 (friends' balloons) = 1 + 8 = 9

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is:
5 * 3 = 15

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons:
9 (initial balloons) + 15 (additional balloons) = 24

The total number of balloons the girls have is 24.

"To find out how many tables they need, we first need to calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have. 

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so they have 10 * 5 = 50 boxes from donations. 
They already have 10 boxes, so in total, they have 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

They can fit 2 boxes per table, and they already have 15 tables. To find out how many more tables they need, we need to divide the total number of boxes by the number of boxes per table and subtract the number of tables they already have.

60 boxes / 2 boxes per table = 30 tables needed
30 tables needed - 15 tables already owned = 15 tables needed

They need 15 new tables.

"To find the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance spat by each person and then divide it by the number of seeds they spat.

Zoey spits 40 seeds, each 10 feet, so the total distance spat by Zoey is 40 * 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney spits 35 seeds, each 12 feet, so the total distance spat by Sydney is 35 * 12 = 420 feet.

The total distance spat by both of them is 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

They spat a total of 40 + 35 = 75 seeds.

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance spat by the number of seeds: 820 / 75 = 10.93 (rounded to two decimal places).

"To find out how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay with the 24-hour option and the cost of his stay with the 12-hour option plus the additional hours.

First, let's calculate the cost of the 24-hour stay: 
The cost for 24 hours is 1600 pesos.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the 12-hour stay plus the additional hours. 
Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is 17 hours. 
He pays for the initial 12 hours at 1000 pesos. 
He has 5 hours left, and each additional hour costs 70 pesos. 
So, the cost for the additional hours is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.

"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to determine the amount each sheep needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Each goat needs 5 pounds, so twice that amount is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds. 
3 pounds less than 10 pounds is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately:

For the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds
For the sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the time James took to swim 60% of the distance.
Distance = 20 miles, Speed = 2 miles per hour
Time = Distance / Speed = 20 / 2 = 10 hours
60% of the distance is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles
Time taken to swim 12 miles = 12 / 2 = 6 hours

Step 2: Calculate the time James rested on the island.
Time taken to swim 12 miles = 6 hours
Time taken to rest = 6 / 2 = 3 hours

Step 3: Calculate the remaining distance.
Remaining distance = 20 - 12 = 8 miles

Step 4: Calculate the time James took to swim the remaining distance at half the speed.
Speed = 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour
Time = Distance / Speed = 8 / 1 = 8 hours

Step 5: Calculate the total time taken by James to get across the lake.
Total time = Time taken to swim 12 miles + Time taken to rest + Time taken to swim the remaining distance
Total time = 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Bahati and Dinar. 

Let's denote the points scored by Dinar as x. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati's points can be represented as x + 10. 

We also know that Azibo scored 20 more points than Bahati, so Azibo's points can be represented as (x + 10) + 20 = x + 30.

The total points scored by the team is 45, which is the sum of the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x + 30) = 45

Combine like terms:

3x + 40 = 45

Subtract 40 from both sides:

3x = 5

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 5/3

However, x represents the points scored by Dinar, which cannot be a fraction. This means that the initial assumption that Dinar's points can be represented as x is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Let's denote the points scored by Dinar as x. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati's points can be represented as x + 10. 

We also know that Azibo scored 20 more points than Bahati, so Azibo's points can be represented as (x + 10) + 20 = x + 30.

The total points scored by the team is 45, which is the sum of the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x + 30) = 45

"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book in inches.

Since there are 100 pages to the inch, and each page is printed on both sides, we have 2 pages per inch. 

Given that the book is 1.5 inches thick, we can multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book:

2 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 3 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 3 * 1.5 = 4.5 * 2 = 9

However, the correct calculation is 2 * 1.5 = 3 * 2 = 6"
"To find the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total time he spent stapling reports and then multiply it by the number of reports he can staple per minute.

First, let's find the total time in minutes. Vince stapled reports from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. 

15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find the number of reports he can staple per minute, we divide 30 by 15.

30 reports / 15 minutes = 2 reports/minute

Now, we multiply the total minutes by the number of reports he can staple per minute.

900 minutes * 2 reports/minute = 1800 reports

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find the total time Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. This is a total of 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 8 hours to minutes: 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so her wake-up time is 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.

Now, we need to find the time she actually slept. Her usual sleep time is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 480 minutes. But she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m., so we need to subtract the time from 6 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. from her usual sleep time.

6 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 5 minutes. So, her actual sleep time is 480 - 5 = 475 minutes.

Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. We need to convert this time to minutes: 2 hours 38 minutes = (2 * 60) + 38 = 138 minutes.

Now, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking from her actual sleep time: 475 - 138 = 337 minutes.

The final answer is: 337"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. 

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

Number of measuring cups = 2 dozen = 2 * 12 = 24
Number of measuring spoons = 2/3 * 24 = 16

Now, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so we subtract 6 from the initial number of measuring spoons:

Number of measuring spoons remaining = 16 - 6 = 10

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the remaining measuring spoons and the measuring cups:

Total number of utensils = 24 (measuring cups) + 10 (measuring spoons) = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the number of occupied beds initially, we need to calculate 1/5 of the total capacity of the hospital.

Total capacity = 1000 beds
Occupied beds = 1/5 * 1000 = 200 beds

Since the hospital has 200 occupied beds initially, the number of unoccupied beds is:
Unoccupied beds = Total capacity - Occupied beds
= 1000 - 200
= 800 beds

Now, let's calculate the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so there are 14 days in 2 weeks.

Number of patients admitted in 2 weeks = 50 patients/day * 14 days
= 700 patients

The total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks will be the sum of the initial occupied beds and the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks.
Total occupied beds = 200 + 700
= 900 beds

Now, we can find the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks:
Unoccupied beds = Total capacity - Total occupied beds
= 1000 - 900
= 100 beds

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we first need to find out how many emails are not work-related. 

Robyn sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to family. Two-thirds of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6. This means 6 emails are to family.

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after removing the work and family emails. We already know that 7 are work emails and 6 are to family, so 9 - 6 = 3 emails are left.

One-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend. One-third of 3 is (1/3) * 3 = 1.

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

"To find Shawna's age, we need to first find Aliya's age, which is given as 3 years. 

Since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we can calculate Shawna's age by multiplying Aliya's age by 3. 
Shawna's age = 3 * 3 = 9 years.

Now, we know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. 
Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age = 5 * 9 = 45 years.

"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from the number she reported.

Let's assume the number Courtney reported is 100%. Since she overstated the number by 20%, the actual number is 80% of the number she reported.

Let x be the actual number of people who attended the concert. We can set up the equation:

x = 0.8 * 48

To find x, we multiply 0.8 by 48.

x = 0.8 * 48
x = 38.4

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is: 38.4"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that Jason carried 2 balls, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. This means that Jeffrey carried half the number of balls that Jason carried, which is 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

We also know that Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls. So, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them: 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

However, this is the number of balls carried by the boys, not the total number of balls the coach brought to practice. Since the boys picked up and carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is equal to the number of balls the boys carried.

Therefore, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many holes the pirates dug in total by the end of the third day, and then use that information to determine how many holes they dug on the fourth day.

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes on the third day. So, the total number of holes at the end of the third day is:

10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is:

4 * 10 = 40

Since there were 29 holes at the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:

40 - 29 = 11

So, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's denote the number of corn chips that Amora and Lainey got as 'x'. Since Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others, Collins got x + 15 corn chips.

We are given that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, so we can set up the equation:

x = 70

Since Collins got x + 15 corn chips, we can set up the equation for the total number of corn chips as:

x + (x + 15) + x = total number of corn chips

Substituting x = 70 into the equation, we get:

70 + (70 + 15) + 70 = total number of corn chips
70 + 85 + 70 = total number of corn chips
225 = total number of corn chips

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the cost of travel, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of supplies. 

First, let's find 50% of the cost of supplies. 
50% of $400 = 0.5 * $400 = $200

Now, we add this to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel.
Cost of travel = Cost of supplies + 50% of cost of supplies
Cost of travel = $400 + $200
Cost of travel = $600

The final answer is: $600"
"Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as X. We are given the following information:

1. X + S + A = 339 (Total number of Pokémon caught)
2. X = S + 5 (Alex has caught 5 more than Stan)
3. S = 4A - 13 (Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe)

We can start by substituting the second equation into the first one to get:
(S + 5) + S + A = 339
Combine like terms:
2S + A + 5 = 339

Now, substitute the third equation into the above equation:
2S + (4A - 13) + 5 = 339
Combine like terms:
2S + 4A - 8 = 339

Now, let's express S in terms of A using the third equation:
S = 4A - 13

Substitute S in the above equation:
2(4A - 13) + 4A - 8 = 339
Expand and simplify:
8A - 26 + 4A - 8 = 339
Combine like terms:
12A - 34 = 339

Add 34 to both sides:
12A = 373

Divide by 12:
A = 31.0833 (However, A must be a whole number since it represents the number of Pokémon caught, so we'll round down to the nearest whole number as we can't have a fraction of a Pokémon)

A = 31

Now, substitute A into the third equation to find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(31) - 13
S = 124 - 13
S = 111

The final answer is: 111"

"To find the total distance traveled by the bird, we need to calculate the distance traveled in each segment of the journey and then add them up.

Distance = speed * time

For the first segment, the bird travels 10 hours at 30 miles per hour:
Distance = 30 * 10 = 300 miles

For the second segment, the bird travels 2 hours at 18 miles per hour:
Distance = 18 * 2 = 36 miles

For the third segment, the bird travels 5 hours at 22 miles per hour:
Distance = 22 * 5 = 110 miles

Now, we need to find the net distance traveled in the southerly direction. The bird traveled 300 miles in the first segment and then 110 miles in the third segment. The second segment was in the northerly direction, so it reduces the total distance traveled in the southerly direction. The bird traveled 36 miles in the northerly direction, so we subtract this from the total distance traveled in the southerly direction:
Net distance = 300 + 110 - 36 = 374 miles

The final answer is: 374"
"To find the total number of brownies Greta had, we need to add the brownies she made, the ones she took home from the office, and the ones her friends had waiting at home.

Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, she made 12 brownies.

She took home 1/2 a dozen brownies from the office. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 1/2 a dozen is equal to 6 brownies.

Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting at home. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen is equal to 48 brownies.

Now, let's add the total number of brownies Greta had: 12 (from home) + 6 (from the office) + 48 (from her friends) = 66 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 1 1/2 dozen is equal to 18 brownies.

To find the number of brownies Greta had left over, we need to subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies she had: 66 - 18 = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to find the age of Nani's brother and sister first.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. To find her age, we multiply Nani's age by 0.75 (which is the decimal equivalent of 75%): 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we add up the ages of all three family members: Nani's age (8) + his brother's age (16) + his sister's age (6) = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time it takes for each type of string and then add them together.

For synthetic gut racquets: 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes
For polyester racquets: 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes
For hybrid racquets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

Now, we add the time for each type of racquet together: 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes

The final answer is: 227"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones.

The cost of the first two phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.

The cost of each of the remaining phones is half the price of the first phone, which is $600 / 2 = $300.

Since there are 2 kids and 1 wife, there are a total of 3 remaining phones. The cost of these phones is 3 * $300 = $900.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones: $1200 + $900 = $2100.

The final answer is: $2100"
"To find the total number of players in both teams, we first need to find the number of players in Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can add 7 to 13 to find the number of players in Zeke's team.

13 (Carlton's players) + 7 = 20

Now that we know Zeke's team has 20 players, we can find the total number of players in both teams by adding the number of players in Zeke's team to the number of players in Carlton's team.

20 (Zeke's players) + 13 (Carlton's players) = 33

The final answer is: 33"
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given that the length (l) is 15 feet and the width (w) is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(15 + 10)
P = 2(25)
P = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

50 feet * 2 slats/foot = 100 slats

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats for his fence.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we first need to determine how many oranges she had initially and then subtract the ones she kept and gave away.

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges. So, the total number of oranges she bought is 12 * 20 = 240.

She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each, which is a total of 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, she gave away 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

Now, she kept 1/4 of the oranges. To find out how many oranges that is, we need to calculate 1/4 of the total number of oranges she had initially, which is 240. 

1/4 of 240 is 240 / 4 = 60. 

So, she kept 60 oranges. 

Now, we subtract the oranges she kept and the ones she gave away from the total number of oranges she had initially. 

240 - 60 - 80 = 100.

Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 100 oranges.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the total number of states in both countries, we first need to determine the number of states in each country. 

The USA has 50 states. 

Half of 50 is 25. 

India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, so India has 25 + 4 = 29 states.

Now, we add the number of states in the USA and India to get the total number of states in both countries: 50 + 29 = 79.

The final answer is: 79"
"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books. 

The total cost of the books is the sum of the cost of the dictionary, the dinosaur book, and the children's cookbook. 

Total cost = $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) 
Total cost = $39

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, we need to subtract this from the total cost to find out how much more he needs to earn.

Amount needed to earn = Total cost - Amount saved
Amount needed to earn = $39 - $14
Amount needed to earn = $25

Now, we know that Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the amount he needs to earn by his hourly wage.

Hours needed to work = Amount needed to earn / Hourly wage
Hours needed to work = $25 / $5
Hours needed to work = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cherries Richard and Jerry have. 

Since Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more than Richard, we can set up an equation to find out how many cherries Richard has. Let's call the number of cherries Richard has 'x'. Then, we can write the equation as x + 10 = 30.

To solve for x, we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: x = 30 - 10, x = 20.

So, Richard has 20 cherries. 

Now, we know that the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert and Richard have 30 and 20 cherries respectively. We can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the total number of cherries Robert and Richard have from the total number of cherries: 60 - 30 - 20 = 10.

So, Jerry has 10 cherries.

Now, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry by subtracting the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has: 30 - 10 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many boxes of gingerbread and apple pie Sunny sold on both Saturday and Sunday, and then calculate the total earnings.

Let's denote the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday as G and the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday as A.

We know that on Saturday, Sunny sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. So, the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday is A + 4.

We also know that on Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday. So, the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday is G + 5.

We are given that on Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. Therefore, A + 4 = 15, which implies A = 11.

We are also given that on Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday. Therefore, G + 5 = G + 5, which implies G = 10.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for Saturday and Sunday.

On Saturday, the total earnings from gingerbread is 10 * 6 = 60 dollars and from apple pie is 11 * 15 = 165 dollars. The total earnings on Saturday is 60 + 165 = 225 dollars.

On Sunday, the total earnings from gingerbread is 10 + 5 = 15 * 6 = 90 dollars and from apple pie is 15 * 15 = 225 dollars. The total earnings on Sunday is 90 + 225 = 315 dollars.

The total earnings for two days is 225 + 315 = 540 dollars.

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we need to calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use over the 8 days.

Since she reapplies sunscreen every hour and will be outside for 4 hours a day, she will use 4 ounces of sunscreen per day. 

Over 8 days, she will use 4 ounces/day * 8 days = 32 ounces.

Since each bottle of sunscreen contains 8 ounces, we need to divide the total amount of sunscreen she will use (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces) to find out how many bottles she will need.

32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles

So, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen for her vacation.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

First, let's find 40% of the price of the blue car:
40% of $100 = 0.4 x $100 = $40

Now, subtract $40 from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car:
$100 - $40 = $60

So, the price of the red car is $60.

The price of the blue car is $100, and the price of the red car is $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Emil is 19 years old now.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

From point 3, we can set up an equation to find the brother's age when Emil turns 24:

Emil's age when he turns 24 = 2 * Brother's age when Emil turns 24
24 = 2 * Brother's age when Emil turns 24
Brother's age when Emil turns 24 = 24 / 2
Brother's age when Emil turns 24 = 12

Now, we know that when Emil turns 24, his dad's age will be twice Emil's age at that time. So, we can set up another equation:

Dad's age when Emil turns 24 = 2 * Emil's age when he turns 24
Dad's age when Emil turns 24 = 2 * 24
Dad's age when Emil turns 24 = 48

Now, we need to find the current ages of Emil's dad and brother. Since Emil is currently 19, we need to subtract 5 years from the ages we found earlier to get their current ages:

Dad's current age = Dad's age when Emil turns 24 - 5
Dad's current age = 48 - 5
Dad's current age = 43

Brother's current age = Brother's age when Emil turns 24 - 5
Brother's current age = 12 - 5
Brother's current age = 7

Now, we can find the sum of their current ages:

Sum of their current ages = Dad's current age + Brother's current age
Sum of their current ages = 43 + 7
Sum of their current ages = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads she received from her mother, sister, and friend, and then add them together.

Adrianne's mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day and add them together.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the amount he caught each day: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by the serving size: 21 / 3 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the number of football players, we need to calculate 20% of 30 students. 

20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students are football players.

Now, we need to find the number of remaining students. 
Remaining students = Total students - Football players
Remaining students = 30 - 6 = 24 students

Next, we need to find the number of cheerleaders or band members. 
25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or band members.
25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students are cheerleaders or band members.

Now, we need to find the total number of students leaving early.

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie's boots are size 5, we can multiply 5 by 5 to find Charlie's boot size.

Charlie's boot size = 5 * 5 = 25

Now, we need to find the average of Sophie's and Charlie's boot sizes. To do this, we add their sizes and divide by 2.

Average size = (Sophie's size + Charlie's size) / 2
Average size = (5 + 25) / 2

"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to calculate the total space available for plants. 

First, we need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches, since the width of the plants is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Now, we need to subtract the space between the plants. Since there are 17 plants, there will be 16 spaces between them. The space between each plant is 1.5 feet, which is 18 inches (1.5 * 12). 

So, the total space taken up by the spaces between the plants is:
16 spaces * 18 inches/space = 288 inches

Now, we subtract this from the total length of the flower bed:
1332 inches - 288 inches = 1044 inches

Now, we need to find out how many plants can fit in this space. The width of each plant is 12 inches, so we divide the total space by the width of each plant:
1044 inches / 12 inches/plant = 87 plants

However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she only needs to buy:
87 plants - 17 plants = 70 plants

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost will be:
70 plants * $6/plant = $420

The final answer is: $420"

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of petunias: 
5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket = 15 petunias
Cost of 15 petunias = 15 * $3.00 = $45.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of sweet potato vines:
5 baskets * 2 sweet potato vines per basket = 10 sweet potato vines
Cost of 10 sweet potato vines = 10 * $2.50 = $25.00

Now, let's add the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines together:
Total cost = $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

The total cost of filling all 5 hanging baskets is $70.00."
"To find out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to determine how much soil is left after planting the sunflowers and carnations.

First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

Now, let's subtract the amount of soil used from the total amount of soil:

30 pounds (total soil) - 27 pounds (used soil) = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, we can plant 3 roses with the remaining soil.

"To find out how much Jessica sets aside each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income. 

25% of $2,000.00 is calculated as 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00.

Since she sets aside $500.00 each month, we need to find out how much she saves in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so we multiply $500.00 by 12.

$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy with $6,000.00. Each pair costs $1,000.00, so we divide $6,000.00 by $1,000.00.

$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many shrimp Emily can peel and cook per minute. 

First, let's find out how many shrimp Emily can cook per minute. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we divide 30 by 10 to get the number of shrimp she can cook per minute: 30 / 10 = 3 shrimp per minute.

Now, let's find out how many shrimp Emily can peel per minute. We already know that she can peel 6 shrimp a minute.

To find out how many shrimp Emily can process (peel and cook) per minute, we add the number of shrimp she can peel per minute and the number of shrimp she can cook per minute: 6 (peeled) + 3 (cooked) = 9 shrimp per minute.

Now, we need to find out how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp. We divide the total number of shrimp by the number of shrimp she can process per minute: 90 / 9 = 10 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in temperature after the air conditioner has been running and turned off.

First, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner is running on low for 3 hours:
Temperature change on low = -2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = -6 degrees

Next, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner is running on high for 4 hours:
Temperature change on high = -3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = -12 degrees

Now, let's calculate the total temperature change when the air conditioner is running:
Total temperature change while running = -6 degrees + (-12 degrees) = -18 degrees

The air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, and the room warms up at 2 degrees an hour:
Temperature change while off = 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees

Now, let's calculate the net temperature change:
Net temperature change = Total temperature change while running + Temperature change while off = -18 degrees + 4 degrees = -14 degrees

Since the net temperature change is -14 degrees, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time. 

Let's denote Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as 'x'. Since Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, and the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can calculate the number of times the comet has orbited the sun since Bill's dad saw it. 

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, and the comet orbits every 75 years, the number of times the comet has orbited the sun since Bill's dad saw it is (x - 30) / 75.

However, we are given that Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. This means that the time difference between the two sightings is 75 years, and Bill's age at the second sighting is 3 * 30 = 90 years.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

x + 75 = 90

Solving for x, we get:

x = 15

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

2. Checks for the gas bill: 1 check per month, so 12 checks per year.
3. Checks to the church: 2 checks per month, so 24 checks per year.
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 1 check every 3 months, so 4 checks per year.

Now, let's add the total number of checks: 
12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52

The final answer is: 52"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as x. Since the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, the number of flights to Greece is (3/4)x. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is (1/4)x.

The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. So, the total number of flights made by the first plane is 2 * 44 = 88.

Now, we can set up an equation to find the number of flights to France:

(1/4)x = (1/2) * 88

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4:

x = 2 * 88
x = 176

Now that we know the total number of flights made by the first plane, we can find the number of flights to France:

(1/4)x = (1/4) * 176
= 44

The final answer is: 44"
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the individual howling times and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since the trousers cost $30, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers to find out how much he had to contribute from his savings:

$30 - $18 = $12

"To solve this problem, we can start by representing the unknown ages of Helene and Wilfred with variables. Let's denote Helene's age as H and Wilfred's age as W.

We know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 20/4 = 5. Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, we can write the equation:

H = 2 * 5
H = 10

We also know that the total age of the children is 20, and we have the ages of Akbar and Alessandro as 3 and 4, respectively. We can write the equation:

3 + 4 + H + W = 20

Substituting the value of H, we get:

7 + 10 + W = 20

Combine like terms:

17 + W = 20

Subtract 17 from both sides:

W = 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund, and then multiply it by 3.

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. 

Total amount collected so far = $500 + $1500 = $2000

However, before his lawyer donates, Walter's friend gives him $200. So, the total amount collected before the lawyer donates is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Walter's lawyer donates three times as much as everyone else donates. Since everyone else (Walter's neighbors and the online fund) donated $2200, the lawyer will donate 3 * $2200 = $6600.

The final answer is: $6600"
"To find the total number of cookies, we multiply the number of guests by the number of cookies each guest brought. 

Total cookies = 100 guests * 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies

Since the bride gave 1/2 of the cookies to the church, we need to find 1/2 of 1500.

1/2 of 1500 = 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies

Now, we know that each person in the church got 15 cookies. To find the number of people in the church, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got.

Number of people in the church = 750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 50 people

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the total number of slices and the ratio of the slices each adult and kid gets.

Let's assume the total number of slices is 6 (since there are 6 people in the family). 

Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid, we can represent the number of slices each kid gets as 'x'. Then, the number of slices each adult gets is 2x.

The total number of slices is the sum of the slices each adult and kid gets. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, we can write the equation:

2(2x) + 4(x) = 6

Simplifying the equation, we get:

4x + 4x = 6
8x = 6

Dividing both sides by 8, we get:

x = 6/8
x = 0.75

Since x represents the number of slices each kid gets, each adult gets 2x = 2(0.75) = 1.5 slices.

The total number of slices is 6, and each adult gets 1.5 slices. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we can divide the number of slices each adult gets by the total number of slices and multiply by 100:

(1.5/6) * 100 = 25%

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

- Time per appointment: 30 minutes
- Total time spent on appointments: 10 * 30 = 300 minutes

Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 + 300 = 480 minutes

Since Doctor Jones works for 9 hours at the clinic, we need to convert this to minutes: 
- 9 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 540 minutes

Now, we subtract the total time spent on rounds and appointments from the total time he works: 
- 540 minutes - 480 minutes = 60 minutes

To convert the remaining time back to hours: 
- 60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Therefore, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records.

"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake. 

First, let's add the time it takes to make the cake batter (20 minutes), bake the cake (30 minutes), and cool the cake (2 hours or 120 minutes). 

Total time so far: 20 + 30 + 120 = 170 minutes

Next, we add the time it takes to frost the cake (10 minutes).

Total time: 170 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours by dividing by 60.

Total time in hours: 180 / 60 = 3 hours

Now, we need to add this total time to the time at which Jordan wants to serve the cake, which is 5:00 pm. 

To find the latest start time, we subtract the total time from the desired serving time. 

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, Jordan can start making the cake at the latest at 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2:00 pm}$"
"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. Since Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. Similarly, Peter sold 4.5x chocolate bars. Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars, so we can set up the equation:

3.5x + 4.5x = 64

Combine like terms:

8x = 64

Divide both sides by 8:

x = 8

The number of chocolate bars in a box is 8.

"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of the students per session, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25. 
The cost of students per session is $1.50 per student, and there are 10 students, so the total cost of students per session is 10 * $1.50 = $15.

The total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $15 (students) = $40.

The studio is rented 3 days a week, so the number of sessions per week is 3. 
There are 4 weeks in a month, so the total number of sessions in a month is 3 * 4 = 12.

The total earnings per session is $40, and there are 12 sessions in a month, so the total earnings in a month is $40 * 12 = $480.

The total earnings of the dance studio in a month is $480."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of chocolate bars in each box for both Peter and Martha.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each box as 'x'. Since Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, the total number of chocolate bars Peter has is 4x. Similarly, since Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, the total number of chocolate bars Martha has is 7x.

We are given that Peter has a total of 64 chocolate bars and Martha has a total of 56 chocolate bars. We can set up the following equations:

4x = 64 (for Peter)
7x = 56 (for Martha)

To find the value of 'x', we can solve either equation. Let's solve the first equation:

4x = 64
x = 64 / 4
x = 16

Now that we know the value of 'x', we can find the number of chocolate bars in each box for both Peter and Martha. Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box, and Martha has 16 / 7 ≈ 2.29 chocolate bars in each box (but since you can't have a fraction of a chocolate bar, we'll round down to 2).

However, since the question asks for the difference in the number of chocolate bars in each box, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha. 

The difference is 16 - 2 = 14

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population. 

3/5 * 50 = 30

So, there are 30 female porcupines in the park.

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

30 * 4 * 12 = 1440

Adding the babies to the initial population, we get:

50 (initial population) + 1440 (babies) = 1490

The final number of porcupines in the park after a year is: 1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company instructed them to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate how many gallons of water they need, we need to do that next.

Gallons = Volume * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the gallons by the cost per gallon.

Cost = Gallons * cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 * 0.10
Cost = 826

The final answer is: $826"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to determine the number of blue and yellow sticks first. 

We know there are 9 red sticks and 5 more blue sticks than red. So, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the distance traveled by Matteo, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles.

To find the distance traveled by Shandy, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles.

Now, we subtract the distance traveled by Matteo from the distance traveled by Shandy to find the difference: 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the number of female students, we first need to find the number of students over 16 and under 16, and then find the number of female students in each group.

Half of the students are over 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500 students.
One-fourth of the students over 16 are male: 1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16.
The number of female students over 16 is 1500 - 375 = 1125.

The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500 students.
One-half of the students under 16 are male: 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16.
The number of female students under 16 is 1500 - 750 = 750.

Now, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16 to find the total number of female students: 1125 + 750 = 1875.

The final answer is: 1875"
"To find out how many laps each person can run, we need to calculate their individual lap counts.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we need to subtract Quinn's lap count from Bethany's lap count: 10 - 5 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total amount of water in the tank after two days, we need to calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped each day.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water in the tank after two days is the sum of the water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on both days: 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons, the amount of water remaining for the tank to be full is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into two parts: the first part where the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour for 5 hours, and the second part where it loses 7% of its capacity per hour for 3 hours.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park is x.

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. This can be represented by the equation:

x - (0.09x * 5) = x - 0.45x = 0.55x

"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings. 

Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, so her total hourly earnings are $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1000.

Next, we need to calculate the amount Janet needs to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of the car, which is 20% of $10,000. 

20% of $10,000 is 0.20 * $10,000 = $2000.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save $2000. We can do this by dividing the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her weekly earnings ($1000).

$2000 / $1000 = 2

So, Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has spent on the fruits he has already purchased and subtract that from the total amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 x $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.5 each: 4 x $0.5 = $2
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 x $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 x $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of fruits purchased: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9

Now, let's subtract the total cost from the amount of money Jamaar has:

$10 (initial amount) - $9 (total cost) = $1

Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can divide the remaining amount by the cost of one plum to find out how many plums Jamaar can buy:

$1 / $0.25 = 4

So, Jamaar can buy 4 plums.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each friend received, we first need to find out how many packs Anne gave to her friends. Since she kept 2 packs for herself, she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to first determine how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures by 8.

Total pictures = 72
Pictures per album = 72 / 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits, the remaining 3 albums must be a mix of both selfies and portraits. However, we are not given any information about the mix of selfies and portraits in these 3 albums. 

But we can still find the total number of selfies and portraits. Since 3 albums were selfies only, the total number of selfies is 3 * 9 = 27. Similarly, 2 albums were portraits only, so the total number of portraits is 2 * 9 = 18.

The final answer is: 
27
18"
"To find the total time James spends reading, we need to determine how many sets of 3 pages he reads and then multiply that by the time it takes to read 3 pages, and add the time it takes to read the remaining pages.

First, let's find out how many sets of 3 pages James reads: 
18 pages / 3 pages per set = 6 sets

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to read 6 sets of 3 pages:
6 sets * 10 minutes per set = 60 minutes

Since James reads 18 pages in total, and 6 sets of 3 pages is 18 pages, he doesn't have any remaining pages to read. Therefore, the total time James spends reading is 60 minutes.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to calculate the number of guests who checked in and subtract the number of guests who checked out.

Initially, there were 100 guests.

24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests remaining is 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, so the number of guests remaining is 76 - 15 = 61.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30.

So, the number of guests now is 61 + 30 = 91.

After dinner, 7 more people checked in, so the final number of guests is 91 + 7 = 98.

The final number of guests in the hotel is 98."
"To find the total number of bananas John has, we need to add the bananas he picked on each day. 

On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas. 
On Thursday, John picked 6 bananas. 
On Friday, John picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add the bananas he picked on each day: 4 + 6 + 12 = 22

The final answer is: 22"
"To find out how many points Aries is sure to get, we first need to determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions. 

40% of 60 questions are easy, so the number of easy questions is 0.4 * 60 = 24 questions.

The rest of the questions are equally divided between average and difficult, so there are (60 - 24) / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 0.75 * 24 = 18 easy questions.

Aries is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 0.5 * 18 = 9 average questions and 0.5 * 18 = 9 difficult questions.

The total number of questions Aries is sure to get is 18 (easy) + 9 (average) + 9 (difficult) = 36 questions.

The final answer is: 36"
"Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 's' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'l'. We are given that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write an equation:

s = 2l

We are also given that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * 4 = $12.

The total earnings from the sales is $120. We can write an equation based on the earnings:

4s + 12l = 120

Substituting s = 2l into the equation, we get:

4(2l) + 12l = 120
8l + 12l = 120
20l = 120

Dividing both sides by 20, we get:

l = 6

Now that we know the number of large stuffed animals sold, we can find the number of small stuffed animals sold:

s = 2l
s = 2 * 6
s = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches each person eats in a week and then add them together.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, so in a week (7 days), he eats 5 * 7 = 35 sandwiches.

The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, so in a week (7 days), she eats 4 * 7 = 28 sandwiches.

The son eats 2 sandwiches per day, so in a week (7 days), he eats 2 * 7 = 14 sandwiches.

Now, let's add the total number of sandwiches each person eats in a week: 35 (man) + 28 (wife) + 14 (son) = 77 sandwiches.

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week.

"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings and then subtract the amount she gave to her sisters.

First, let's calculate her earnings from selling cookies: 
80 cookies * $1 each = $80

Next, let's calculate her earnings from selling cupcakes: 
60 cupcakes * $4 each = $240

Now, let's add her earnings from cookies and cupcakes: 
$80 + $240 = $320

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave a total of: 
2 * $10 = $20

Now, let's subtract the amount she gave to her sisters from her total earnings: 
$320 - $20 = $300

"To find the number of eggs found by the friends, we first need to determine the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins. Since each twin found 30 eggs, the total number of eggs found by the twins is 2 * 30 = 60.

Now, we know that all the eggs except 10 were found by the twins and their friends. This means that the total number of eggs found by the twins and their friends is 100 - 10 = 90.

Since the twins found 60 eggs, the number of eggs found by the friends is 90 - 60 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then multiply it by 40 dwarves and 30 days.

First, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe. Since he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe as with his bare hands, he can mine 2 * 12 = 24 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe.

Next, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. He can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe. To find 50% of 24 pounds, we multiply 24 by 0.5, which is 12. Then, we add this to 24 to get 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes. Since one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, 40 dwarves can mine 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds of ore per day.

Finally, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in 30 days with steel pickaxes. We multiply 1440 pounds per day by 30 days to get 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds of ore.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to establish the ratio of the number of sandwiches to the price for the first two packages. 

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, and the second package has 4 sandwiches for $6. 

We can set up a proportion to find the price of the third package:

(2 sandwiches / $3) = (4 sandwiches / $6) = (8 sandwiches / x)

We can simplify the first two ratios to find the price per sandwich:

$3 / 2 = $6 / 4
$3 / 2 = $1.5 / 2
$1.5 = $3 / 4

Now we can multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches in the third package to find the price:

x = ($1.5 * 8)
x = $12

The price of the package with 8 sandwiches is $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to first calculate how much he still owes after using the money from selling his old bedroom set.

Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000 and sells his old bedroom for $1000. 

So, the amount he still owes is $3000 - $1000 = $2000.

He has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month. 

To find 10% of $2000, we multiply $2000 by 0.10 (since 10% is the same as 0.10).

$2000 * 0.10 = $200.

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 40% of 25 is 0.4 * 25 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 12 / 2 = 6. So, 6 yellow balloons were released, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Then, Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

Now, let's calculate the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school. She had 15 red balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons. 

15 + 6 + 6 = 27

"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability of the complement of the event that he won't have to turn it in. 

There are three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 

1. The substitute teacher doesn't collect homework (50% chance), 
2. The normal teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance), 
3. The normal teacher doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces her his dog ate his assignment (20% chance).

However, the last scenario is dependent on the first two not happening. So, we need to find the probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus not convincing her, which is 60% (100% - 40%) * 80% (100% - 20%). 

Now, we can find the total probability of Marcus not having to turn in his homework by adding the probabilities of the first two scenarios and the last scenario: 50% + 40% + (60% * 80%) = 50% + 40% + 48% = 138%. However, this is not possible since probabilities cannot exceed 100%. This is because we've double-counted the scenario where the substitute teacher doesn't collect homework and the normal teacher gives everyone an extension. 

To find the correct probability, we need to subtract the overlap: 138% - 40% = 98%. However, this is still not correct because we've subtracted too much. The correct way to find the probability of the complement is to find the probability of the normal teacher giving everyone an extension and the substitute teacher not collecting homework, then add the probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension but Marcus convincing her, and the probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus not convincing her. 

The probability of the normal teacher giving everyone an extension and the substitute teacher not collecting homework is 40% * 50% = 20%. The probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension but Marcus convincing her is 60% * 20% = 12%. The probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus not convincing her is 60% * 80% = 48%. 

Now, we can find the total probability of Marcus not having to turn in his homework by adding these probabilities: 20% + 12% + 48% = 80%. 

The probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is the complement of this, which is 100% - 80% = 20%.

"To find out how many tickets each graduate can receive, we first need to determine the total number of available seats for guests. 

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center: 6000
Seats for graduates: 950
Seats for faculty: 300

Total seats taken: 950 + 300 = 1250

Available seats for guests: 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive.

4750 / 950 = 5

Each graduate can receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the relationship between the number of small beans and the number of large beans. 

First, we know that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. This means that the number of small beans is 3 times the number of medium beans.

Since Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, the number of medium beans is 2 times the number of large beans. 

Let's denote the number of large beans as L. Then, the number of medium beans is 2L, and the number of small beans is 3(2L) = 6L.

We are given that it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up. So, L = 75.

Now, we can find the number of small beans by substituting L = 75 into the equation for the number of small beans: 6L = 6(75) = 450.

"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total earnings and total expenses.

Total earnings: Melissa is paid $15 per day for 3 days, so her total earnings are 15 * 3 = $45.

Total expenses: Melissa pays $3 for parking each day for 3 days, so her total expenses are 3 * 3 = $9.

Now, let's calculate her net earnings: Net earnings = Total earnings - Total expenses = 45 - 9 = $36.

Since Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, her total hours worked is 6 * 3 = 18 hours.

To find out her hourly wage after expenses, we divide her net earnings by the total hours worked: Hourly wage = Net earnings / Total hours worked = 36 / 18 = $2.

"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to find the total number of soda bottles and then multiply it by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next.

First, let's find the total number of soda bottles. The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle every 3 feet. 

Number of bottles = Total width of the driveway / Distance between each bottle
Number of bottles = 24 / 3
Number of bottles = 8

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to go to 7 more bottles (8 total bottles - 1 = 7).

Time to go from one bottle to the next = 5 seconds
Total time = Number of remaining bottles * Time to go from one bottle to the next
Total time = 7 * 5
Total time = 35

"To find out how many packs Uncle Franky can make, we need to first find out how many apples he has in total. Since he ordered two boxes and each box has 40 apples, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of apples in each box.

Total apples = 2 boxes * 40 apples/box = 80 apples

Now, we need to find out how many packs he can make with 80 apples. Since each pack has 8 apples, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each pack.

Number of packs = Total apples / apples per pack = 80 / 8 = 10

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples.

"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought and subtract it from the initial amount of money she had.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 x $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 x $6 = $18.
The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor starts with $50, so subtracting the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount of money, we get:
$50 - $40 = $10.

So, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost due to loans and lost income while in college. 

The total amount of loans he took is 4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000.

The amount of money he lost while in college is 4 years * $25,000/year = $100,000.

The total amount of money he needs to earn is $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

After college, his income triples, so he now earns $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year.

To find out how long it will take him to earn the total amount of $300,000, we can use the formula for simple interest:

Time = Total Amount / Annual Income
Time = $300,000 / $75,000
Time = 4 years

However, this is the time it would take to earn the money at the new income level, but we need to consider the time it took to earn the money before college. 

So, the total time it will take is 4 years (before college) + 4 years (after college) = 8 years.

"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and add them up.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 
So, they delivered 204 + 5 = 209 letters on Wednesday.

"To find the average loss, we need to calculate the total loss and then divide it by the number of races.

First, let's calculate the amount lost in each race:

1. First race: -$5
2. Second race: He won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. 
   Twice the amount he previously lost is 2 * (-$5) = -$10
   He won $1 more than that, so he won $(-10 + $1) = -$9
   So, the net gain in the second race is -$9
3. Third race: He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   He won $9 in the second race, so he lost 1.5 * $9 = $13.5 in the third race.

Now, let's calculate the total loss:
Total loss = -$5 (first race) + $9 (second race) + $13.5 (third race)
Total loss = -$5 + $9 + $13.5
Total loss = $17.5

There were 3 races, so the average loss is:

"To solve this problem, let's denote the share of the first person as x. 

Since the second person took $80 more than the first, the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine like terms again:

4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:

"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks and then divide it by the number of painters and the fraction of the day they worked each day.

First, let's convert 3 weeks to days: 3 weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since the painters worked 3/8ths of a day each day, we need to find the total hours in a day and multiply it by 3/8.

There are 24 hours in a day. To find 3/8 of 24, we multiply 24 by 3 and divide by 8: (24 * 3) / 8 = 72 / 8 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms again:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

Number of balls in the first set = x + 4
= 6 + 4

"To find the total amount Alison spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

1. The tank top costs $10.
2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48, but they were on sale for half price. Half of $48 is $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The athletic socks cost $8, and she had a coupon for $2 off, so the socks cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:
$10 (tank top) + $15 (shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55

The final answer is: $55"
"To find the total cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and then multiply it by the cost of each tile.

First, we need to find the area of a single tile. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1 ft, the area of a single tile is:

Area of a single tile = side length * side length
= 1 ft * 1 ft
= 1 sq ft

Now, we need to find the total number of tiles required to cover the kitchen floor. We can do this by dividing the total area of the kitchen floor by the area of a single tile:

Total number of tiles = Total area of kitchen floor / Area of a single tile
= 200 sq ft / 1 sq ft
= 200 tiles

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the total number of tiles by the cost of each tile:

Total cost = Total number of tiles * Cost of each tile
= 200 tiles * $12
= $2400

The final answer is: $2400"
"To find the increased cost of the insurance, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

60% of $120 = 0.6 * $120 = $72

Increased cost = Normal cost + Increased cost = $120 + $72 = $192

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we need to multiply it by 12 to find the yearly cost.

Yearly cost = Increased cost * 12 = $192 * 12 = $2304

The final answer is: $2304"
"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a week, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he puts on the beds and divide it by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. Since a twin bed has 1 set of sheets and a king size bed has 1 set of sheets, the total number of sheets he puts on the beds is 4 + 1 = 5 sets.

Since his laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time, we need to convert the total number of sheets to the number of loads. We can wash 2 twin sets of sheets (2 * 1 = 2 sheets) and 1 king set of sheets (1 * 1 = 1 sheet) in one load. So, we can wash 3 sets of sheets in one load.

Now, we can divide the total number of sheets by the number of sheets we can wash in one load: 5 sets / 3 sets per load = 1.67 loads. Since we can't do a fraction of a load, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can do 2 loads of laundry with 1 set of twin sheets left over. 

To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we multiply the number of loads he does in a week by the number of weeks in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year is 2 * 52 = 104 loads.

The final answer is: 104"
"To find the total number of movies Jill and her friends watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of movies they watch in one weekend and multiply it by 4.

They watch 4 movies on Saturday. 
On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies as on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in one weekend, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

To find the total number of movies they watch in 4 weeks, we multiply the number of movies they watch in one weekend by 4:
6 * 4 = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to calculate the number of stickers he collected this year and add it to the total number of stickers he had last year.

Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, so he collected 2 * 50 = 100 stickers this year.

The total number of stickers Leo had last year was 100 (initial stickers) + 50 (stickers collected last year) = 150 stickers.

This year, Leo collected 100 stickers, so the total number of stickers he has now is 150 (stickers he had last year) + 100 (stickers collected this year) = 250 stickers.

The final answer is: 250"
"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount of cat food each cat eats per day (60 grams).

First, we need to calculate the total amount of cat food each cat eats per day. Since Imma has 3 cats and each cat eats 60 grams of food twice a day, we multiply 60 grams by 2 to get the daily consumption per cat: 60 * 2 = 120 grams.

Now, we multiply the daily consumption per cat by the number of cats: 120 * 3 = 360 grams.

Next, we divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the daily consumption of all cats (360 grams): 720 / 360 = 2.

The cat food will last for 2 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many slices Jake and Silvia ate. 

Since Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake, Jake must have eaten 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

Now, we know that Becky ate 10 slices, Jake ate 7 slices, and Silvia ate 14 slices. To find the total number of slices they ate, we add these numbers together: 10 + 7 + 14 = 31.

The final answer is: 31"
"Let's denote the time Donovan took to make his part as 'x'. Since Betsy took 18 minutes longer than Donovan, the time Betsy took can be represented as (x + 18).

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of the time taken by both Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. So, we can write the equation as:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since x represents the time Donovan took, and Betsy took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's part took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

The final answer is: 58"
"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of the cast, the visit, the painkillers, and the parking.

1. The cost of the cast is $200.
2. The cost of the visit is $300/hour for 0.5 hours (since it's a 30-minute visit). 
   So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.
3. The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill for 30 pills. 
   So, the cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.
4. The cost of parking is $6/hour for 2 hours (the mandatory minimum).
   So, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up the costs:
$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The final answer is: $482"
"To find out how many emails James responds to, we first need to find out how many emails he doesn't respond to. 

20% of 80 emails is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails. 

Since James doesn't respond to these 16 emails, he responds to the rest. The rest of the emails are 80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Now, we need to find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week. Since he responds to 64 emails per day, in a 5-day work week, he responds to 64 * 5 = 320 emails.

The final answer is: 320"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we need to calculate the number of classes that visited each day and then add them up.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the number of classes that visited each day:
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 207

"To find the average score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the number of tests. 

First, let's add up the scores of the first 3 tests: 100 + 100 + 100 = 300. 

Then, we add the score of the 4th test: 300 + 80 = 380.

Now, we divide the total score by the number of tests: 380 / 4 = 95.

The final answer is: 95"
"To find the total number of pizzas left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team, and then subtract that from the total number of pizzas ordered.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 
70% of 20 is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 
They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

The total number of pizzas eaten is 14 (by the glee club) + 32 (by the football team) = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered is 20 (by the glee club) + 40 (by the football team) = 60 pizzas.

The number of pizzas left is 60 (total pizzas) - 46 (pizzas eaten) = 14 pizzas.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of big coupons. Since Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and he is sending out 700 small coupons, he will send out 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons.

The cost of mailing the small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

The cost of mailing the big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

To find the total cost of postage, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

The final answer is: $245"
"To find out how many meatballs were in the sub sandwiches that remained, we need to calculate the total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches initially ordered by Sidney, then subtract the number of meatballs eaten by Mark, and finally subtract the number of meatballs in the additional sub sandwiches ordered by Sidney.

Sidney initially ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means he ordered 10 - 3 = 7 sub sandwiches.

Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, so the total number of meatballs in the 7 sub sandwiches is 7 * 4 = 28.

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's sub sandwiches, which means 4 * 4 = 16 meatballs were eaten.

The number of meatballs remaining after Mark ate 4 sub sandwiches is 28 - 16 = 12.

Sidney then ordered 3 more sub sandwiches, which means 3 * 4 = 12 more meatballs were added.

However, since Sidney ordered 3 more sub sandwiches, the number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is still 12.

The final number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is 12."
"To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we first need to find out how many trucks were still operational after the mechanical failures. 

Mr Hezekiah had 20 trucks dispatched, and a quarter of them had mechanical failures. A quarter of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5. 

So, 5 trucks had mechanical failures, leaving 20 - 5 = 15 trucks operational.

Each operational truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 * 20 = 300 tons.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total cost of the butter, we first need to determine how much Dennis needs to buy. Since he needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

Since the grocery store has a promotion for buy one pound of butter get one half off, we can calculate the cost of 6 pounds of butter as follows:

- For the first pound, the cost is $4.00.
- For the second pound, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).
- For the third pound, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).
- For the fourth pound, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).
- For the fifth pound, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).
- For the sixth pound, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).

The total cost of 6 pounds of butter is $4.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 = $12.00.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find the total cost of the party, we need to calculate the number of additional guests beyond the initial 20 and then multiply that by the cost per additional guest. 

First, let's find the total number of guests: 
Kayla invited 25 classmates + 7 dance class girls + 13 family members = 45 guests. 
However, 4 people said they could not come, so the total number of guests is 45 - 4 = 41.

Since the initial 20 guests are included in the rental fee, we need to find the number of additional guests: 
41 (total guests) - 20 (initial guests) = 21 additional guests.

Now, let's calculate the cost for the additional guests: 
21 additional guests * $6 per guest = $126.

The total cost of the party is the rental fee plus the cost for the additional guests: 
$125 (rental fee) + $126 (additional guests) = $251.

The final answer is: $251"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Maggie and Riza had initially. 

Let's assume the initial amount of money they had is 'x'. 

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, so she has 3/4 * x left. 
Riza spent one-third of her money, so she has 2/3 * x left.

We are given that both of them have $60 left. 

So, we can set up the equation: 
3/4 * x = 60 (for Maggie) 
2/3 * x = 60 (for Riza)

To find the value of x, we can solve either equation. Let's solve the first one: 
3/4 * x = 60 
x = 60 * 4/3 
x = 80

Now that we know the initial amount of money they had, we can find the total amount of money they have left. 
Maggie has 3/4 * 80 = 60 dollars left. 
Riza has 2/3 * 80 = 53.33 dollars left. 

The total amount of money they have left is 60 + 53.33 = 113.33 dollars.

The final answer is: $113.33"
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine how many bananas the first and second monkeys eat each day. 

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. 

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Since there are three monkeys in total, the total number of bananas they eat each day is 10 + 14 + x, where x is the number of bananas the third monkey eats. 

We know that the total number of bananas is 315, and they last for a week, which is 7 days. So, the total number of bananas eaten in a week is 315 * 7 = 2205 bananas.

Since the total number of bananas eaten in a week is 2205, and the first two monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas each day, the third monkey eats 2205 - (24 * 7) bananas in a week. 

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week: 24 * 7 = 168 bananas.

Now, let's calculate the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week: 2205 - 168 = 2037 bananas.

However, this is the total number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week. To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to divide the total number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week by 7.

The number of bananas eaten by the third monkey each day is 2037 / 7 = 291 bananas.

However, this is not correct because we know that the total number of bananas is 315, and the first two monkeys eat 24 bananas each day. So, the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day, which is 315 - 24 = 291 bananas. This is the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey each day.

The final answer is: 291"
"To find out how many puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he placed. 

Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which is 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. 

Then, he finished another 500 piece puzzle, which is 500 pieces. 

So, the total number of pieces he placed is 250 + 500 = 750 pieces.

The final answer is: 750"
"To find out how much Jenny paid for the roses, we need to calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since roses cost $2 each, the total cost would be 15 * $2 = $30. However, since she bought a dozen roses for $15, we need to subtract the cost of the dozen from the total cost. 

15 roses - 1 dozen (12 roses) = 3 roses left to buy at $2 each. 
3 * $2 = $6. 
$30 - $15 = $15. 
So, the total cost of the roses is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25. 

To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she paid with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so we multiply $4 by 4 to get the total number of quarters: $4 * 4 = 16 quarters.

Jenny leaves with 16 quarters. 

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the revenue from each item and add them together.

"To find the time Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time from the moment he arrives at the station to the moment the fourth train arrives.

The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it also leaves at 125 minutes.

The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Since Paul is waiting for the fourth train, we need to find the time from the moment he arrives at the station to the moment the fourth train arrives. We don't know the exact time Paul arrives, but we can assume it's 0 minutes for simplicity. 

The time Paul will wait for his train is 145 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks Melanie needs to save toothpicks, we first need to determine how many toothpicks she has saved so far. 

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. 
So, the total number of toothpicks saved = 10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks.

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks for the sculpture, and she already has 120, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs to save. 
Number of toothpicks needed = 200 - 120 = 80 toothpicks.

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week. To find out how many weeks it will take her to save 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks needed by the number of toothpicks saved per week.
Number of weeks = 80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to first find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and then the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price, so the price he paid is:

2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Then, he sold it to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, so the price his friend paid is:

1500 * 1.20 = $1800

Now, to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to find the difference between the original price and the price his friend paid, and then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100:

(2000 - 1800) / 2000 * 100 = 10%

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours and then multiply it by the number of springs and the rate at which they create jellyfish.

There are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour. 

In 4 hours, there are 4 * 3600 = 14400 seconds.

Since each spring creates a new jellyfish every second, the rate of jellyfish creation per spring is 1 jellyfish per second.

With 5 springs working at the same rate, the total rate of jellyfish creation is 5 jellyfish per second.

To find the total number of jellyfish created in 14400 seconds, we multiply the rate of jellyfish creation per second by the total number of seconds: 5 * 14400 = 72000.

Binkie's score is 90. Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180. 

Now, we add 15 to twice Binkie's score to find Frankie's score: 180 + 15 = 195.

The final answer is: 195"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it takes James to walk to the halfway point and the time it takes him to walk back home.

First, let's find the distance to the halfway point. Since the total distance to the store is 4 miles, the halfway point is 4 / 2 = 2 miles.

Since James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, the time it takes him to walk to the halfway point is 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours.

Now, he walks back home, which is the same distance of 2 miles. The time it takes him to walk back home is also 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours.

However, the question asks for the time it takes him to reach the store, which is the sum of the time it takes to walk to the halfway point and the time it takes to walk back home. So, the total time is 0.5 hours + 0.5 hours = 1 hour.

"To find the total cost of buying bananas individually, we need to calculate the cost of 10 bunches of bananas with 4 bananas each. 

First, let's find the total number of bananas: 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

Now, let's find the cost of buying the bananas in bunches: 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

To find the amount saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation. Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.

We know that the total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence. To find out how much is left over, we need to subtract the amount Sam gets from the total amount of fence:

100 - 20 = 80

"To find the rate at which the crocodile grows per year, we need to divide the growth in inches by the number of years. 

Growth per year = Total growth / Number of years
Growth per year = 8 inches / 4 years
Growth per year = 2 inches/year

Now, we can multiply the growth per year by the total number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

Total growth in 13 years = Growth per year * Total years
Total growth in 13 years = 2 inches/year * 13 years
Total growth in 13 years = 26 inches

"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

First, let's find the number of each type of bike sold:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150
- BMX bikes: 300 * 0.15 = 45
- MTB bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each type of bike:
- Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250 (since BMX is half the price of MTB, which is $500, so BMX is $500 / 2 = $250)
- MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add up the earnings from each type of bike:
$67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour and works for 6 hours, so the total number of bales made is 5 * 6 = 30.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour and works for 6 hours, so the total number of bales picked up is 3 * 6 = 18.

Now, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made: 30 - 18 = 12.

The number of bales left in the field is 12."
"To find the total minutes John spends in class, we first need to find the total minutes he spends in a day. Since he has 6 periods in a day and each class is 40 minutes long, we multiply the number of periods by the duration of each class:

6 periods/day * 40 minutes/period = 240 minutes/day

Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, we multiply the daily minutes by 5:

240 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1200 minutes/week

Next, we need to find the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. 1/16 of his weekly minutes is spent on these days. First, we need to find the total minutes in a week:

There are 60 minutes in an hour and 24 hours in a day. So, there are 24 * 60 = 1440 minutes in a day. 

There are 5 days in a week, so there are 5 * 1440 = 7200 minutes in a week.

1/16 of the total minutes in a week is spent on Saturday and Sunday:

(1/16) * 7200 minutes/week = 450 minutes/week

Now, we add the minutes spent in class to the extra minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday:

1200 minutes/week + 450 minutes/week = 1650 minutes/week

To convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

1650 minutes/week / 60 = 27.5 hours/week

The final answer is: 27.5"
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is the height of the third floor, which is 24 feet.

The height of the ball after the first bounce is 2/3 of the initial height:
(2/3) * 24 = 16 feet

The height of the ball after the second bounce is 2/3 of the height after the first bounce:
(2/3) * 16 = 10.67 feet

The final answer is: 10.67"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child in inches. 

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 6 feet to inches by multiplying 6 by 12. 
6 feet * 12 inches/foot = 72 inches

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so we add 2 inches to the height of the first child.
72 inches + 2 inches = 74 inches

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so we subtract 5 inches from the height of the second child.
74 inches - 5 inches = 69 inches

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so we add 3 inches to the height of the third child.
69 inches + 3 inches = 72 inches

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10).

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now that we know the orchard sold 200 bags, we can multiply the number of bags by the price per bag ($5) to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The final answer is: $1000"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

First, we know that the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. Since they ate the last part, the velociraptors must have eaten the remaining meat after the T-Rex. 

Let's call the total amount of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate 'x'. The T-Rex ate half of it, so the remaining meat is x/2. 

The velociraptors then ate half of the remaining meat, which is (x/2)/2 = x/4. 

Now, we know that the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which is the remaining meat after the velociraptors ate. So, we can set up the equation: x/4 = 270.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 4: x = 270 * 4.

x = 1080

The final answer is: 1080"
"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted and then divide it by the coverage of a gallon of paint to find out how many gallons are needed. After that, we can multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon to get the total cost.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their area is 10 * 8 = 80 square feet each. Since there are two of them, their total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their area is 5 * 8 = 40 square feet each. Since there are two of them, their total area is 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

The total area of all the walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

The cost per gallon is $12, so the total cost is 12 * 12 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the probability that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the remaining number of shaken and unshaken sodas after Ellen's brother took some.

Initially, there were 3 shaken sodas and 9 unshaken sodas. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving:

- 2 shaken sodas
- 7 unshaken sodas

Ellen's friend will choose a soda randomly from the remaining 9 sodas (2 shaken + 7 unshaken). The probability of choosing a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas:

Probability = Number of shaken sodas / Total number of sodas
= 2 / 9

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

Probability = (2 / 9) * 100
= 22.22%

The final answer is: $\boxed{22.22}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we add the distances they traveled to find the total distance between them: 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the total number of days Billy helps, we first need to calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. To do this, we multiply 50 by 0.20, which is 10. 

Now, we subtract the number of days off from the total number of days: 50 - 10 = 40.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so we need to find the total number of hours he works in a day. This is 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of days he works by the number of people he can help per day: 40 * 6 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that were transported by the buses and the cars, and then subtract that from the total number of people that were present.

First, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the buses:
12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the cars:
20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Now, let's add the number of people transported by the buses and the cars:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the number of people transported from the total number of people present. However, the total number of people present is not given. We can assume that the total number of people present is the sum of the people transported by the buses and the cars, plus the people who were already inside the church. But since we don't have the number of people already inside the church, we can't calculate the total number of people present.

However, we can calculate the number of people who were not inside the church, which is the number of people transported by the buses and the cars:
480 people

But since we are asked for the number of people inside the church, we can assume that the number of people inside the church is the total number of people present minus the number of people transported by the buses and the cars. However, we don't have the total number of people present.

"To find Jeff's age, we need to first determine Martha's age, and then add 10 to it. 

Since Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can find Martha's age by subtracting 4 from Mike's age.

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now that we know Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age by adding 10 to Martha's age.

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of each slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: 
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute
Time = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute
Time = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide from the time it takes to ride the biggest slide:
Difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide
Difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes
Difference = 2 minutes

"To find the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 x 15-minute breaks per day. 
Total time spent per day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 2 x 15 minutes (breaks) = 30 + 30 = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunch and breaks. 
To find the total time spent over 5 days, we multiply the daily time by 5:

Now that we know Micah ran 28 miles, we can subtract the total miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles run by all three to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

Total miles run by all three = 52
Miles run by Amber = 8
Miles run by Micah = 28
Miles run by Ahito = Total miles run by all three - (Miles run by Amber + Miles run by Micah)
Miles run by Ahito = 52 - (8 + 28)
Miles run by Ahito = 52 - 36
Miles run by Ahito = 16

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total amount she spent after returning the item and then add that to the initial charge minus the returned item.

1. Initial charge: $85.00
2. Return: -$15.00 (since she returned an item)
   New balance after return: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

3. Frying pan purchase: 20% off $20.00
   Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
   Price of frying pan: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

4. Towel purchase: 10% off $30.00
   Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
   Price of towels: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

5. Total new purchases: $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00

6. New balance on credit card: $70.00 (previous balance) + $43.00 (new purchases) = $113.00

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's start by identifying the information given:

- A fifth of the jellyfish are large.
- A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light.
- The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue.
- When a UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color.

Since a third of the large jellyfish change color, and 6 jellyfish changed color, we can set up an equation to find the number of large jellyfish:

(1/3) * (number of large jellyfish) = 6

To solve for the number of large jellyfish, we can multiply both sides by 3:

number of large jellyfish = 6 * 3
number of large jellyfish = 18

Now that we know there are 18 large jellyfish, we can find the total number of jellyfish in the tank. Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, we can set up an equation:

(1/5) * (total number of jellyfish) = 18

To solve for the total number of jellyfish, we can multiply both sides by 5:

total number of jellyfish = 18 * 5
total number of jellyfish = 90

The final answer is: 90"

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Lauren needs to save for her retirement and then determine how many years she needs to work to accumulate that amount.

First, let's calculate Lauren's current annual savings. Since she saves 20% of her $100,000 salary, her annual savings is:

Annual savings = 20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000

Next, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save for her retirement. Since she plans to live on 40% of her current salary in retirement, her retirement income will be:

Retirement income = 40% of $100,000 = 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000 per year

Since she plans to live for 20 years in retirement, the total amount she needs to save is:

Total amount needed = Retirement income * Number of years in retirement
= $40,000 * 20
= $800,000

Now, we need to calculate how many years she needs to work to accumulate this amount. We can use the formula:

Number of years = Total amount needed / Annual savings
= $800,000 / $20,000
= 40 years

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to accumulate the amount, but we need to subtract the 20 years she plans to live in retirement. Therefore, the number of years she needs to work is:

Number of years = Total number of years - Number of years in retirement
= 40 - 20
= 20 years

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to first divide the total length of the ribbon by 4 to get the length of each of the initial cuts. 

100 cm / 4 = 25 cm

Then, we need to divide the length of each initial cut by 5 to get the length of each final cut.

25 cm / 5 = 5 cm

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total population of the school, we can use the information given. Since 40% of the school population is 240 boys, we can set up the equation:

40% of x = 240

To solve for x, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:

0.4x = 240

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.4 to isolate x:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

So, the total population of the school is 600.

Since 40% of the school population is boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. We can find the number of girls by multiplying the total population by 0.6 (60% as a decimal):

Number of girls = 0.6 * 600
Number of girls = 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to add the cost of the pots and the garden soil, then subtract the discount.

Cost of pots: $19

The three women wearing 4-inch heels have a total height of 3 x 4 = 12 inches.
The three women wearing 2-inch heels have a total height of 3 x 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.
There are 6 women in total.

The average height of heels at the party is 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike, we first need to determine how many days she has in June. June has 30 days.

Since Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days, we can calculate her daily target by dividing the total miles by the number of days:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Soledad is planning to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is a total of 250 miles per day. To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we subtract her planned daily miles from her target daily miles:

310 miles per day - 250 miles per day = 60 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total amount the store will receive after selling all the balls, we need to calculate the total revenue from each color of ball and add them together.

The store has 3 red balls, each costing $9, so the total revenue from red balls is 3 x $9 = $27.

The store has 11 blue balls, each costing $5, so the total revenue from blue balls is 11 x $5 = $55.

The store has 25 green balls, each costing $3, so the total revenue from green balls is 25 x $3 = $75.

Now, we add the revenue from each color of ball together: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157.

The store will have received a total of $157 after all the balls are sold.

The final answer is: $157"
"To find out how much James will have left, we first need to determine how much Pierre and Paul will take. 

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 1/4 * 12 = 3 kg. 

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 1/3 * 12 = 4 kg.

So, Pierre and Paul will take 3 kg + 4 kg = 7 kg in total.

To find out how much James will have left, we subtract the total taken by Pierre and Paul from the initial amount: 12 kg - 7 kg = 5 kg.

The final answer is: 5"

The final answer is: -3"
"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the amount he had initially, and then add the amount he saved.

Raymond initially had $21. He saved $11, so we add that to his initial amount: $21 + $11 = $32.

Then, he spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle, so we subtract the total amount he spent from the new total: $32 - ($5 + $19) = $32 - $24 = $8.

So, Raymond has $8 left.

The final answer is: $8"
"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first determine how much Anna spent in total. We know she had a budget of $16 and has $2 left, so she spent $16 - $2 = $14.

Since she spent $14 and bought 2 books that cost the same amount, we can divide the total amount spent by 2 to find the cost of each book. 

$14 / 2 = $7

So, each book cost $7. 

The final answer is: $7"
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we need to calculate 20% of the previous year's enrollment and add it to the previous year's enrollment.

20% of 50 is 0.20 x 50 = 10.

"To find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we need to first find the rate at which the light blinks per minute. 

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. To find the rate per minute, we divide the number of blinks by the number of minutes: 

255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute.

Now that we know the rate, we can find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times by dividing the total number of blinks by the rate per minute:

459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute = 9 minutes.

"To find the total time they all took to do their chores, we need to calculate the time each person took and add them together.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took 4 hours longer than Amalia, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, let's add the time each person took to do their chores: 
4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"To find the total distance John drives in a round trip, we need to calculate the distance for one way and multiply it by 2. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles (for one way)

Since it's a round trip, we multiply the one-way distance by 2:
Total Distance = 140 miles * 2
Total Distance = 280 miles

Since John visits his parents twice a month, we need to multiply the total distance by 2:
Total Distance per month = 280 miles * 2
Total Distance per month = 560 miles

The final answer is: 560"
"To find out how many miles Brian will walk in 7 days, we first need to determine how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we multiply 10 miles by 7 days.

10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we can set up an equation where Brian's distance is half of Sofie's distance. 

Let x be Brian's distance in 7 days. Then, x = 70 miles / 2

x = 35 miles

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

The final answer is: 35"
"To find the number of toys produced by the first 4 workers, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour and the 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour.

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour produce a total of 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour. 
The 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour produce a total of 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour.

So, the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers per hour is 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

Since they work for 10 hours, the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 20 * 10 = 200 toys.

The total number of toys needed is 400, and 200 toys were produced by the first 4 workers. Therefore, the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker is 400 - 200 = 200 toys.

Since the fifth worker works for 10 hours, the number of toys produced by the fifth worker per hour is 200 / 10 = 20 toys per hour.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we first need to find the weight of each of his dogs. 

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/4 to find the weight of Elijah's first dog: 60 * 1/4 = 15 pounds.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/2 to find the weight of Elijah's second dog: 60 * 1/2 = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of Elijah's two dogs to find the total weight of his dogs: 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

To find the total weight of all three dogs, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs: 60 + 45 = 105 pounds.

The final answer is: 105"
"To solve this problem, let's work backwards from the information given.

Let's denote the number of stickers Seth had initially as 'x'.

Kris had 7 stickers, which is half of what he received from Luis. So, Luis gave Kris 7 * 2 = 14 stickers.

Since Kris kept 9 stickers, Luis must have given him 14 - 9 = 5 stickers. This means Luis had 5 * 2 = 10 stickers before giving some to Kris.

Now, Luis had 10 stickers, which is half of what he received from Seth. So, Seth gave Luis 10 * 2 = 20 stickers.

Therefore, Seth had 20 stickers initially.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to first find the total weight of the M&M's in ounces and then multiply it by the number of M&M's per ounce.

Since John buys 3 large bags weighing 10 ounces each, the total weight of the M&M's is 3 * 10 = 30 ounces.

Since an ounce of M&M's has 30 M&M's, the total number of M&M's is 30 ounces * 30 M&M's/ounce = 900 M&M's.

To find the number of small bags John can make, we divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag: 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's/small bag = 90 small bags.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to first calculate half of the circumference of the earth. 

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of that would be 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers at a speed of 400 kilometers per day. 

To do this, we can divide the total distance (20,000 kilometers) by Alfie's speed (400 kilometers per day). 

20,000 kilometers / 400 kilometers per day = 50 days.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

First, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so we multiply 120 by 5 to find the speed of the 2nd fastest car.

Speed of the 2nd fastest car = 120 * 5 = 600 miles per hour

Now, we know the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. To find the speed of the faster car, we multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25.

Speed of the faster car = 600 * 1.25 = 750 miles per hour

Liam's current age is 16 years. Two years ago, Liam's age was 16 - 2 = 14 years.

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. So, Vince's age two years ago was 14 / 2 = 7 years.

To find Vince's current age, we need to add 2 years to his age two years ago. Vince's current age is 7 + 2 = 9 years.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S.

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so A = M.

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. This can be expressed as C + S = 30 and C = S + 12.

We can rewrite the second equation as C = S + 12 and substitute it into the first equation: (S + 12) + S = 30.

Combine like terms: 2S + 12 = 30.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 2S = 18.

Divide both sides by 2: S = 9.

Now that we know S, we can find C: C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21.

Since A = M, and the total number of eggs is 56, we can write the equation A + M + C + S = 56.

Substitute the values of A, M, C, and S: A + A + 21 + 9 = 56.

Combine like terms: 2A + 30 = 56.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2A = 26.

Divide both sides by 2: A = 13.

Now that we know A, we can find the difference between C and A: C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we first need to find the total number of boxes and the total weight of the crayons and boxes in ounces.

Since Nik has 200 crayons and each box can hold 8 crayons, we can find the total number of boxes by dividing 200 by 8.

200 / 8 = 25

So, Nik will need 25 boxes.

Each box weighs 8 ounces, and there are 25 boxes, so the total weight of the boxes is:

25 * 8 = 200 ounces

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, and there are 200 crayons, so the total weight of the crayons is:

200 * 1 = 200 ounces

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is the sum of their individual weights:

200 (boxes) + 200 (crayons) = 400 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the total weight from ounces to pounds by dividing by 16:

400 / 16 = 25

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many logs John can make, we need to calculate 80% of 80 feet. 

80% of 80 = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet long, we can divide the total length of the usable tree by the length of each log to find the number of logs.

64 / 4 = 16 logs

From each log, John cuts 5 planks. So, the total number of planks is:

16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks

John sells each plank for $1.2. To find the total amount he makes, we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank:

80 planks * $1.2/plank = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to first find the salary of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is 1/2 of what her brother earns. So, her brother's salary is 2 times Valerie's salary, which is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary. The combined salary of Valerie and her brother is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000. So, their mother's salary is 2 * $15,000 = $30,000.

Now, we add up their salaries to find the total amount of money they all have together: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Grandma's speed on the beach and on the sidewalk. 

Let's denote Grandma's speed on the beach as x miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. The time spent on the beach is 40 minutes. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed to find her speed on the beach.

Time spent on the beach = 2 miles / x miles/minute = 40 minutes

To find x, we can rearrange the equation: x = 2 miles / 40 minutes = 1/20 miles/minute.

Now that we know her speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk: 2x = 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles/minute.

Now, we can find the time spent on the sidewalk: time = 1 mile / (1/10 miles/minute) = 10 minutes.

The total time spent walking is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk: 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Jane to save a total of $60, we first need to calculate how much she has saved so far. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved is:
$4/week * 8 weeks = $32

Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach a total of $60:
$60 (target) - $32 (already saved) = $28

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings to find out how many more weeks it will take:
$28 / $4/week = 7 weeks

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add the number of blue birds in each group of trees.

First, let's calculate the number of blue birds in the 3 trees with 7 blue birds each:
3 trees * 7 blue birds/tree = 21 blue birds

Next, let's calculate the number of blue birds in the 2 trees with 4 blue birds each:
2 trees * 4 blue birds/tree = 8 blue birds

Then, we add the number of blue birds in the tree with 3 blue birds:
8 blue birds + 3 blue birds = 11 blue birds

Now, we add the number of blue birds in the first group of trees to the number of blue birds in the second group:
21 blue birds + 8 blue birds = 29 blue birds

Finally, we add the number of blue birds in the last tree to the total:
29 blue birds + 11 blue birds = 40 blue birds

"Let's denote the number of marbles Bob initially has as 'x'. 

If he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have x + 2*12 = x + 24 marbles. According to the problem, this equals 60. 

So, we can write the equation: x + 24 = 60.

To find the initial number of marbles Bob has, we need to solve for x. Subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

x = 60 - 24
x = 36

Now, we know Bob initially has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 marbles, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles.

The final answer is: 26"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature of the second bottle of water. 

Let's denote the temperature of the second bottle as x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle, the total temperature of the water in the bottle is the average of the two temperatures, weighted by the amount of water poured from each mug. 

The total temperature of the water in the bottle after pouring is (33 * 4 + x * 1) / (4 + 1) = (132 + x) / 5.

Since Donny can now drink the water, the temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees. 

We can set up the inequality (132 + x) / 5 ≥ 40 to represent this situation.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the inequality by 5 to get 132 + x ≥ 200.

Subtracting 132 from both sides gives us x ≥ 68.

Therefore, the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of cows:

Initial number of cows = 50
Cows brought per day = 20
Number of days in three weeks = 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days
Total cows brought = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of cows = Initial number of cows + Total cows brought = 50 + 420 = 470 cows

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens:

Initial number of chickens = 20
Chickens brought per day = 10
Total chickens brought = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
Total number of chickens = Initial number of chickens + Total chickens brought = 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

Now, let's add the total number of cows and chickens to find the total number of animals on the farm:

Total number of animals = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens = 470 + 230 = 700

The final answer is: 700"
"To find the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels, we first need to calculate the original price. Since each pack costs $10.00 and there are 4 packs, the total cost is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to find 10% of $40.00. To do this, we multiply $40.00 by 0.10, which is $4.00. 

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since there are 4 packs and each pack has 9 bagels, the total number of bagels is 4 * 9 = 36.

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops, so we can write an equation:

Gomer's scoops = 23 - 5
Gomer's scoops = 18

Next, let's find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops, so we can write an equation:

Potatoes per scoop = 6 - 3
Potatoes per scoop = 3

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate. We know that Gomer ate 18 scoops, and it takes 3 potatoes to make 1 scoop. So, we can multiply the number of scoops by the number of potatoes per scoop:

Potatoes eaten = Gomer's scoops * Potatoes per scoop
Potatoes eaten = 18 * 3
Potatoes eaten = 54

"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, and then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days is:
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

In the next 30 days, Chester increases his egg consumption to 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days is:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, we add the total number of eggs from both periods:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens:
240 eggs / 12 = 20 dozens

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can let the number of men be 5x and the number of women be 9x. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the equation: 5x + 9x = 84

Combine like terms: 14x = 84

Divide both sides by 14: x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of women on the bus initially: 9x = 9 * 6 = 54

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining is: 54 - 20 = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many sunflowers and bouquets Faraday sold per day. 

Let's denote the number of sunflowers sold per day as 's' and the number of bouquets sold per day as 'b'. We know that each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, so the total number of sunflowers sold per day is 12b + s.

We are given that Faraday earned $26 from the sunflowers and $56 from the bouquets per day. Since each sunflower costs $2 and each bouquet costs $8, we can set up the following equations:

2s + 8b = 26 (equation 1)
8b = 56 (equation 2)

From equation 2, we can solve for b:
b = 56 / 8
b = 7

Now that we know b, we can substitute this value into equation 1 to solve for s:
2s + 8(7) = 26
2s + 56 = 26
2s = -30
s = -15

However, the number of sunflowers sold per day cannot be negative, so this solution is not valid. Let's re-examine the problem. We can rewrite equation 1 as:
2s + 8b = 26
2s = 26 - 8b

Since we know that b = 7, we can substitute this value into the equation above:
2s = 26 - 8(7)
2s = 26 - 56
2s = -30

"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys, the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks, and then find the difference between the two.

First, let's find out how many rocks Adam can buy with $100. Since each rock costs $5, we divide $100 by $5:

$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Now, Adam sells 60% of his 20 rocks. To find 60% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.6:

20 * 0.6 = 12 rocks

Since Adam sells each rock for $7, the total revenue from selling 12 rocks is:

12 * $7 = $84

Now, let's find the total cost of the rocks. Adam bought 20 rocks at $5 each:

20 * $5 = $100

Since Adam only sells 12 rocks, he still has 8 rocks left. The cost of these unsold rocks is:

8 * $5 = $40

The total cost of the rocks is the cost of the unsold rocks plus the revenue from the sold rocks:

$100 (initial investment) - $84 (revenue) = $16 (loss from the sold rocks)
$16 (loss from the sold rocks) + $40 (cost of the unsold rocks) = $56 (total loss)

However, the question asks for the loss from the initial investment, which is the loss from the sold rocks.

The final answer is: $16"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene. 

First, let's find the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene:

- Large-sized picture scenes: 45 / 5 = 9 days
- Medium-sized picture scenes: 36 / 6 = 6 days
- Small-sized picture scenes: 49 / 7 = 7 days

Now, we need to find the LCM of 9, 6, and 7. 

The prime factorization of 9 is 3^2
The prime factorization of 6 is 2 * 3
The prime factorization of 7 is 7

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:
- The highest power of 2 is 2^1 (from 6)
- The highest power of 3 is 3^2 (from 9)
- The highest power of 7 is 7^1 (from 7)

The LCM is 2^1 * 3^2 * 7^1 = 2 * 9 * 7 = 126

Therefore, it will take Lauren 126 days to complete all the picture scenes.

The final answer is: 126"
"To find out how many eggs each child receives, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. 

First, let's determine the total number of eggs. Since Chatty prepared three dozen eggs, we need to convert the dozen to a numerical value. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so three dozen eggs would be 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children: 36 eggs / 4 children = 9 eggs per child.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to calculate the total cost of food for one month.

Since each fish needs $1 worth of food per day, and Jen has 3 fish, the daily cost of food for all her fish is 3 * $1 = $3.

To find the total cost for the month, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days in May: $3 * 31 = $93.

The final answer is: $93"
"To find out how many roses Patricia has now, we need to subtract the number of roses she gave away from the initial number of roses, then add the number of roses she bought.

First, subtract the number of roses given away from the initial number: 30 - 24 = 6
Then, add the number of roses bought: 6 + 15 = 21

So, Patricia now has 21 roses.

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning. 

The probability of the first ticket winning is 20% or 0.2. 
The probability of the second ticket winning is three times more likely, so it's 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

The probability of both tickets winning is the product of their individual probabilities: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many seashells Carrey collected. Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as x.

Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, the number of seashells Carlos collected is 2x.

We are also given that Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so the number of seashells Jim collected is 2x + 5.

We know that the total number of seashells collected is the sum of the seashells collected by each person: x + 2x + (2x + 5) = 5x + 5.

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, we can set up the equation (5x + 5) / 3 = y, where y is the number of seashells each person gets.

To find the value of x, we can set up an equation using the information that the total number of seashells is 27. We know that x + 2x + (2x + 5) = 27.

Combine like terms: 5x + 5 = 27

Subtract 5 from both sides: 5x = 22

Divide both sides by 5: x = 22 / 5
x = 4.4

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of seashells each person gets. 

First, we need to find the total number of seashells: 5x + 5 = 5(4.4) + 5 = 22 + 5 = 27

Now, we can divide the total number of seashells by 3 to find the number of seashells each person gets: 27 / 3 = 9

"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and add the number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday). So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 + 5 = 10.

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week: 20 + 10 = 30.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. 

The second song is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes. To find 60% of 5 minutes, we multiply 5 by 0.6 (which is the decimal form of 60%).

5 * 0.6 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song. To find the total length of the second song, we add 3 minutes to the length of the first song.

5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now, we have the lengths of both songs: 5 minutes for the first song and 8 minutes for the second song. To find the total time of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs.

5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the profit from each day and then add them together.

On Monday, Linus bought 2 devices for $20 each, so the total cost is 2 x $20 = $40. He sold each device for twice the original price, which is 2 x $20 = $40. So, the profit from each device is $40 - $20 = $20. Since he bought 2 devices, the total profit from Monday is 2 x $20 = $40.

On Tuesday, Linus bought 4 devices for $20 each, so the total cost is 4 x $20 = $80. He sold each device for twice the original price, which is 2 x $20 = $40. So, the profit from each device is $40 - $20 = $20. Since he bought 4 devices, the total profit from Tuesday is 4 x $20 = $80.

The total profit is the sum of the profit from Monday and Tuesday, which is $40 + $80 = $120.

"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to first determine Carl's height. We know that Isabel is 7 feet tall and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel. 

Isabel's height = 7 feet
Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
Ned's height = 7 - 2
Ned's height = 5 feet

Since Carl is one foot taller than Ned, we can find Carl's height by adding 1 foot to Ned's height.

Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 + 1
Carl's height = 6 feet

We are given that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. To find the length of the cane, we can divide Carl's height by 2.

Length of Carl's cane = Carl's height / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 6 / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 3 feet

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles required to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

Since each bottle covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, we need 100% / 20% = 5 bottles.

For 2300 people, we need 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, to find out how many more bottles it needs to produce, we subtract the number of bottles it can produce from the total number of bottles required: 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

First, let's find the number of babies wearing purple and blue. Since Carla has 8 babies and 3/4 of them wear purple, the number of purple babies is 3/4 * 8 = 6. The number of blue babies is 1/4 * 8 = 2.

Next, we need to find the number of babies wearing bows. All 2 blue babies wear bows, and 1/3 of the 6 purple babies also wear bows. So, the number of purple babies wearing bows is 1/3 * 6 = 2. The total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4.

Now, we need to find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This is the number of purple babies wearing bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows, multiplied by 100. So, the percentage chance is (2 / 4) * 100 = 50%.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received last week, and then subtract the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday.

Total reports received last week = 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received last week - (Reports received on Monday and Tuesday + Reports received on Thursday and Friday)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Reports received on Wednesday = 1125

"To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the amount of money he earned from each sale and add them together.

First, Abraham sold half of his land for $50. Since he owns 80 square meters, half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. 

Next, he sold 1/4 of his land for $30. Since he owns 80 square meters, 1/4 of that is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters.

The remaining land is 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters.

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, the amount of money he earned from selling the remaining land is 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he earned. He earned $50 from the first sale, $30 from the second sale, and $60 from the third sale. 

Total money earned = $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find Geb's age, we need to first find half of Haley's age and then subtract 10 from it.

Haley's age is 26 years. Half of 26 is 26 / 2 = 13.

Now, we subtract 10 from 13 to find Geb's age: 13 - 10 = 3.

Geb is 3 years old."
"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to first find out how many face masks he uses in a day. 

Since Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out and he goes out three times a day, the total number of face masks he uses in a day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, to find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses in a day by 2. 

6 * 2 = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of eggs found, we need to calculate the number of eggs each person found and add them up.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.
Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.
Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

The total number of eggs found is 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27.

Since Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, we need to convert 3 dozen to a numerical value. 1 dozen is equal to 12, so 3 dozen is equal to 3 * 12 = 36.

The number of eggs still hidden in the yard is 36 - 27 = 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total number of apartments in the first two complexes, we multiply the number of apartments in each by 2: 200 * 2 = 400.

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400. To find 60% of 400, we multiply 400 by 0.6: 400 * 0.6 = 240. Then we add 240 to 400: 400 + 240 = 640. So the last complex has 640 apartments.

Now we add the number of apartments in the first two complexes to the number of apartments in the last complex: 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so we multiply the total number of apartments by 3: 1440 * 3 = 4320.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment, so we multiply the total number of collections by the pay per collection: 4320 * 0.40 = 1728.

The final answer is: $1728"
"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and add them up.

- Year 1 (5 years old): 50 fruits
- Year 2 (6 years old): 3 times the initial amount = 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
- Year 3 (7 years old): 7 times the initial amount = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
- Year 4 (8 years old): 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree = 10 * 50 - 200 = 450 fruits
- Year 5 (9 years old): 0 fruits (no production)
- Year 6 (10 years old): 20 times the initial amount = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced:
50 + 150 + 350 + 450 + 0 + 1000 = 1900

The total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life is 1900."
"To find out how much money Jack has now, we need to calculate 1/5 of Sophia's $100 and add it to Jack's initial $100.

Sophia's 1/5 of $100 is calculated as: 100 * (1/5) = 20

Now, we add this amount to Jack's initial $100: 100 + 20 = 120

Jack now has $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as x. Since the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, the length of the yellow rope is x + 7.

The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so its length is 4x.

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation:

x + (x + 7) + 4x = 37

Combine like terms:

6x + 7 = 37

Subtract 7 from both sides:

6x = 30

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 5

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope:

Length of red rope = 4x = 4(5) = 20

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume Ronnie was given x dollars initially. Since Rissa was given thrice as much, Rissa was given 3x dollars.

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Ronnie is left with (x - y) dollars and Rissa is left with (3x - y) dollars, where y is the amount they each gave to their little sister.

We are given that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

(3x - y) = (4/5)(3x)

To solve for y, we can multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction:

5(3x - y) = 4(3x)
15x - 5y = 12x

Now, let's isolate y by subtracting 12x from both sides:

15x - 12x - 5y = 12x - 12x
3x - 5y = 0

Now, let's add 5y to both sides:

3x = 5y

Now, let's divide both sides by 5:

(3/5)x = y

Now, let's substitute this expression for y into the equation for Ronnie's remaining money:

(x - y) = (x - (3/5)x)
= (x - (3/5)x)
= (2/5)x

Now, we are given that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

(3x - y) = (4/5)(3x)
(3x - (3/5)x) = (4/5)(3x)
(6/5)x = (4/5)(3x)

Now, let's multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction:

6x = 4(3x)
6x = 12x

Now, let's divide both sides by 6:

x = 2

Now that we know x, we can find the amount of money Ronnie is left with:

(2/5)x
= (2/5)(2)
= 4/5 * 2
= 4/5 * 2
= 8/5 * 1
= 8/5"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as 'x'. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, the total amount of these three colors is 3x.

We are given that half the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint is half of the total paint used, which is 12 pints. Therefore, the amount of yellow paint is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.

The total amount of paint used is the sum of the amounts of red, white, purple, and yellow paint. We know that the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, so we can set up the equation:

3x + 6 = 12

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 12 - 6
3x = 6

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for x:

x = 6 / 3
x = 2

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, the amount of red paint is x, which is 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, then add them together.

First, let's find the area of one bedroom: 
Area of one bedroom = length * width = 20 * 12 = 240 square feet

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms = 4 * 240 = 960 square feet

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area = 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas together: 
Total area of the house = area of bedrooms + area of living room + area of the rest of the house
Total area of the house = 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet

"To find the total number of clouds Alice counted, we need to calculate the number of clouds for each day and add them up.

On Monday, Alice counts 3 clouds.

On Tuesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Monday, which is 2 * 3 = 6 clouds.

On Wednesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.

On Thursday, she counts double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.

On Friday, she counts double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add up the number of clouds for each day: 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93.

"To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run with the new box for $1, we first need to determine how many pods are in the new box. 

The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box. To find 20% of 100, we multiply 100 by 0.2: 
100 * 0.2 = 20

Now, we add the 20% to the original 100 pods to find the total number of pods in the new box:
100 + 20 = 120

Since each cycle requires 1 pod, the new box can run 120 cycles.

To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to know how many cycles you can run with the new box for $12. Since the new box costs $12, we divide 120 by 12 to find the number of cycles per dollar:
120 / 12 = 10

Now, we multiply the number of cycles per dollar by 1 to find the number of cycles for $1:
10 * 1 = 10

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since he withdraws 1000 dollars in 20 dollar bills, he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home. So, he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he uses 20 bills to pay for the bill. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he has 20 bills left, and each bill is worth $20, he has 20 * 20 = $400. Tripling this amount gives him 3 * 400 = $1200.

5. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we need to divide the total amount of money by 5. 1200 / 5 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

The total number of goals scored by team A is 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals. The total number of goals scored by team B is 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to determine how much chalk is left after Monday and then calculate how many days it will last at the 20% usage rate.

The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he used 45% of it. To find out how much he used, we multiply 5 by 0.45:

5 * 0.45 = 2.25 inches

So, the teacher used 2.25 inches of chalk on Monday. To find out how much is left, we subtract this from the original length:

5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches

Now, we need to find out how many days the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk will last at the 20% usage rate. To do this, we'll divide the remaining length by the daily usage rate (20% or 0.20):

2.75 / 0.20 = 13.75

Since the teacher can't use a fraction of a day, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can still use the full 13.75 days because the teacher will still have some chalk left after 13 days.

One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so the number of boys on varsity is 12 * (1/4) = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

Since there are 12 boys and 12 girls in the class, the total number of students is 12 + 12 = 24.

The number of students not on varsity is 24 (total students) - 7 (students on varsity) = 17.

The total number of teeth the dentist works on is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15.

Now, we need to find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes. To do this, we divide the total number of teeth the dentist works on by the total number of James' teeth and multiply by 100.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:

C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:

75 = 2C + 35

"To find out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza is needed for, and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

For the cheese pizza, Kate's 6 friends each eat 6 slices, so the total number of cheese pizza slices needed is 6 friends * 6 slices per friend = 36 slices. 

For the pepperoni pizza, Kate's 6 friends each eat 4 slices, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices needed is 6 friends * 4 slices per friend = 24 slices.

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to find the total number of whole pizzas needed for each type. 

For the cheese pizza, 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas. 

For the pepperoni pizza, 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas.

Since Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, she needs a total of 3 + 3 = 6 pizzas.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the net rate at which Jay is building snowballs. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in 1 hour, which is equivalent to 60 minutes. So, his rate of building snowballs is 20/60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. To find the rate at which snowballs melt, we divide the number of snowballs that melt by the time it takes for them to melt: 2/15 snowballs per minute.

Now, we need to find the net rate at which Jay is building snowballs. This is the rate at which he builds snowballs minus the rate at which they melt: (1/3) - (2/15) = (5/15) - (2/15) = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Since Jay wants to have 60 snowballs, we need to find out how many minutes it will take to build 60 snowballs at a rate of 1/5 snowballs per minute. We can do this by dividing the total number of snowballs by the net rate: 60 / (1/5) = 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

However, this is the time it would take if Jay didn't melt any snowballs. Since he melts 2 snowballs every 15 minutes, we need to account for this. 

Let's find the number of 15-minute intervals in 300 minutes: 300 / 15 = 20 intervals.

In each 15-minute interval, Jay loses 2 snowballs. So, in 20 intervals, he loses 20 * 2 = 40 snowballs.

To find the actual number of snowballs Jay will have after 300 minutes, we subtract the number of snowballs he lost from the total number of snowballs he built: 60 - 40 = 20 snowballs.

However, this is not the answer we are looking for. We want to know how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs. 

Let's re-evaluate the situation. Jay builds 20 snowballs in 60 minutes, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. So, in 60 minutes, Jay builds 20 snowballs, but 4 melt (2 every 15 minutes). 

In 120 minutes, Jay builds 40 snowballs, but 8 melt. In 180 minutes, Jay builds 60 snowballs, but 12 melt. 

Since Jay builds 60 snowballs in 180 minutes, but 12 melt, he will have 48 snowballs left. However, we want to know when Jay will have 60 snowballs. 

Let's find the time it takes for Jay to build 2 more snowballs. Jay builds 20 snowballs in 60 minutes, so he builds 1 snowball in 3 minutes. 

Since Jay needs 2 more snowballs, it will take him 2 * 3 = 6 minutes to build 2 more snowballs.

Therefore, the total time it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs is 180 + 6 = 186 minutes.

"To find Jim's age, we need to first determine John's age 20 years ago. Since John is 28 now, we subtract 20 from 28 to find his age at the time of the Digimon release.

28 - 20 = 8

Since John was twice as old as Jim at that time, we can set up an equation to represent the relationship between their ages:

John's age 20 years ago = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago

We know John's age 20 years ago was 8, so we can substitute that into the equation:

8 = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago

To find Jim's age 20 years ago, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Jim's age 20 years ago = 8 / 2
Jim's age 20 years ago = 4

Now, we need to find Jim's current age. Since 20 years have passed, we add 20 to Jim's age 20 years ago:

Jim's current age = 4 + 20
Jim's current age = 24

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the remaining bandages after the first day are x - 38 + 50.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The remaining bandages after the second day are (x - 38 + 50) - 28.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they had 100 bandages added. They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. The remaining bandages after the third day are ((x - 38 + 50) - 28) + 100 - 25.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation:

(x - 38 + 50) - 28 + 100 - 25 = 78

Simplifying the equation:

x - 38 + 50 - 28 + 100 - 25 = 78
x + 57 = 78

Subtracting 57 from both sides:

x = 21

The initial number of bandages is 21.

The cost of the color is $40.

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, and May's hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, so the length of hair cut is 10 - 8 = 2 inches. 

The cost of the haircut is 2 inches * $30 per inch = $60.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut: $40 + $60 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To find Jen's total earnings, we need to calculate her total hours worked and her total attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her total hours worked in April. She works 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week. Since there are 4 weeks in April, we multiply the number of hours she works per day by the number of days she works per week and then by the number of weeks in April.

Total hours worked per week = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week
Total hours worked in April = 45 hours/week * 4 weeks = 180 hours

Now, let's calculate her total earnings from her hourly rate. Her hourly rate is $1.5, so we multiply her total hours worked by her hourly rate.

Total earnings from hourly rate = 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Next, we need to add her attendance bonus. Since she had complete attendance for the month, she receives an additional $10.

Total earnings = Total earnings from hourly rate + Attendance bonus
Total earnings = $270 + $10
Total earnings = $280

The final answer is: $280"

Earnings for doing laundry: $3.00
Earnings for cleaning the room: $1.50
Earnings for taking the trash to the curb: $0.75 * 2 = $1.50
Earnings for emptying the dishwasher: $0.50 * 6 = $3.00

Total earnings for the two-week period: $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 + $3.00 = $8.00

The final answer is: $8.00"
"To find the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we first need to find the amount of blood in one shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, a shark has 3 * 40 = 120 gallons of blood.

Now, we need to multiply the amount of blood in one shark by the number of sharks to find the total amount of blood in ten sharks. 

120 gallons (one shark) * 10 sharks = 1200 gallons.

The final answer is: 1200"
"To find the total number of people who entered the restaurant, we need to calculate the number of people who entered at each time and add them up.

First, 50 people entered in the morning. 
Then, 40 more people entered at 10:00. 
Next, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. 
Finally, 3 times as many people as the number that came in first (50) entered by evening, which is 3 * 50 = 150 people.

Now, let's add up the number of people who entered at each time: 
50 (morning) + 40 (10:00) + 80 (lunch) + 150 (evening) = 320

The total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we first need to find the number of red pens and the number of black pens. 

Since Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens and each pack has 5 pens, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 pens.

It's given that Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. So, the number of black pens is 2 * 25 = 50 pens.

The total number of pens Alain has is the sum of the red pens and the black pens, which is 25 + 50 = 75 pens.

The final answer is: 75"
"To find the total cost, we first need to determine the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. To find the cost per bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles: $600 / 10 = $60 per bottle.

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of the cognac is 50% more than the scotch, so the cost per bottle of cognac is $60 + (50% of $60) = $60 + $30 = $90 per bottle.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 bottles * $90 per bottle = $1800.

The total cost of everything is the sum of the cost of the scotch and the cognac: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how many Lodgepole Pine trees Mr. Julius planted on the first day. Since he planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine as White Oak, and he planted 20 White Oak trees, he planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so the total number of White Oak trees is 20 + 10 = 30.

For Lodgepole Pine, he planted 1/4 more than the first day, which is 1/4 of 40, or 10. So, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

Now, let's add up the total number of trees planted over the two days. The total number of White Oak trees is 20 + 10 = 30. The total number of Lodgepole Pine trees is 40 + 50 = 90.

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 30 + 90 = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how much root beer was available for each person to drink, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer remaining after all the incidents.

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, 4 gallons were stolen by his children, so the remaining amount is:
24 - 4 = 20 gallons

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, so the remaining amount is:
20 - 7 = 13 gallons

On the third day, 5 gallons were taken by Ronnie, so the remaining amount is:
13 - 5 = 8 gallons

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, and they shared the remaining root beer equally. To find out how much each person got, we need to divide the remaining amount by 3 (the number of people):
8 / 3 = 2.67 gallons

So, each person got approximately 2.67 gallons of root beer to drink during the party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.67}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let x be the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge. 

The problem states that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. We can write this as an equation:

4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for x:

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we need to calculate one-third of the total number of fish. 

One-third of 66 is calculated as 66 / 3 = 22.

Now, we have 66 - 22 = 44 fish left without red stripes. 

To find the number of fish with blue stripes, we need to calculate 5/11 of the remaining fish. 

5/11 of 44 is calculated as (5/11) * 44 = 20.

Now, we have the number of fish with red stripes (22) and the number of fish with blue stripes (20). 

To find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes, we add the two numbers together: 22 + 20 = 42.

The final answer is: 42"
"To find out how many eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we need to calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors she initially had and then subtract the ones she lost or used up.

Amy initially had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors from the palettes.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 eyeshadow colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister stole one of the palettes, which had 4 colors, so Amy lost 4 eyeshadow colors.

Amy used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which had 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she used up 3 eyeshadow colors.

In total, Amy lost 4 + 3 = 7 eyeshadow colors.

To find out how many eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we subtract the ones she lost from the total: 26 - 7 = 19.

The final answer is: 19"
"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to break down the information given.

1. Mattison's height is 60 inches.
2. The two-story house is 7 times as high as Mattison, so the total height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.
3. The first floor's floor to ceiling height is thrice as high as Mattison, so it is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.
4. Since the total height of the house is 420 inches and the first floor's height is 180 inches, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.
5. The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is the same as the height of the second floor, which is 240 inches.

"To find the number of shells found by team Alphas, we need to calculate 40% of 700. 

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells remaining after team Alphas found their share. 

Remaining shells = Total shells - Shells found by Alphas
= 700 - 280
= 420 shells.

Next, we need to find the number of shells found by team The finders, which is 60% of the remaining shells.

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells found by team Gogetters. This is the remaining shells after team The finders found their share.

Shells found by Gogetters = Remaining shells - Shells found by The finders

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we first need to calculate the total miles walked by the first three dogs. 

The first dog needs to walk 1 mile, the second needs 4 miles, and the third needs 3 miles. 

Total miles walked by the first three dogs = 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

Since there are 4 dogs in total and they need to walk an average of 3 miles per day, the total miles they need to walk in a day is 4 * 3 = 12 miles.

Now, to find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles they need to walk in a day.

Miles the last dog needs to walk = Total miles they need to walk - Total miles walked by the first three dogs
= 12 - 8

"To find out how much John borrowed, we need to calculate 40% of the value of his house. 

40% of $250,000 = 0.4 * $250,000 = $100,000

Now, John uses 60% of the loan to pay off his debts. 

60% of $100,000 = 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000

This means John used $60,000 to pay off his debts. To find out how much he has leftover, we subtract this amount from the loan amount.

$100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

"To find the total weight of the tunas caught, we need to add the weights of all three tunas. 

Weight of the first tuna = 56 kilograms
Weight of the second tuna = 46 kilograms
Weight of the last tuna = 26 kilograms

Total weight of the tunas = 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we can multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Total weight of the tunas * Cost per kilogram
Total earnings = 128 * 0.50
Total earnings = 64

"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first find the selling price of the magazines. 

The cost price of the magazines is $72. 

Trinity sells the magazines at 11/8 of the price she bought them. To find the selling price, we multiply the cost price by 11/8.

Selling price = Cost price * (11/8)
= $72 * (11/8)
= $72 * 1.375
= $99

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price.

Profit = Selling price - Cost price
= $99 - $72

"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed on each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed on the low setting is:
1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes 2 liters of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed on the medium setting is:
2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes 4 liters of water per day (2 * 2 = 4). Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total amount of water removed on the high setting is:
4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters

Now, we add the total amount of water removed on each setting to find the total amount of water removed:
3 liters (low) + 6 liters (medium) + 20 liters (high) = 29 liters

"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we first need to find the capacity of John's school. 

Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we can find the capacity of one of John's classes by multiplying Ali's class capacity by 1/8.

Capacity of one of John's classes = 120 * (1/8) = 15

Since John has two classes, we multiply the capacity of one class by 2 to find the total capacity of John's school.

Capacity of John's school = 15 * 2 = 30

Now, we add the capacity of Ali's school (which is 120) to the capacity of John's school to find the combined capacity of both schools.

Combined capacity = 120 + 30 = 150

"To find the total amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we first need to calculate the total interest he owes his sister. 

The interest rate is 2% of the principal amount, which is $300. 

Interest = 2% of $300 = 0.02 * $300 = $6

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, the total amount he will pay in these 11 months is:

Total paid in 11 months = $25 * 11 = $275

The remaining amount, including the interest, will be paid in the twelfth month. This remaining amount is the principal plus the interest:

Remaining amount = Principal + Interest = $300 + $6 = $306

However, Stephen has already paid $275 in the previous 11 months. So, the amount he will pay in the twelfth month is the remaining amount minus the amount already paid:

Amount paid in the twelfth month = Remaining amount - Total paid in 11 months
= $306 - $275
= $31

"To find the total volume of the jar, we need to calculate the area of the base and multiply it by the height. The base is a square with a side length of 6 inches, so the area is 6 * 6 = 36 square inches. Multiplying this by the height of 15 inches gives us a volume of 36 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, we need to divide the volume of the jar by 0.8 to get the total volume that can be occupied by the jelly beans. This gives us 540 / 0.8 = 675 cubic inches.

Each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, so we can divide the total volume that can be occupied by the jelly beans by the volume of a single jelly bean to get the total number of jelly beans. This gives us 675 / 0.15 = 4500 jelly beans.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3 to get the number of red jelly beans. This gives us 4500 * 0.3 = 1350 red jelly beans.

However, we are given that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we need to calculate the difference between his estimated number of red jelly beans and the true number. 

First, we need to find Tim's estimated number of red jelly beans.  We know that the jar can hold 4500 jelly beans, and 30% of them are red.  So, the number of red jelly beans is 4500 * 0.3 = 1350.  However, we are given that the true number of red jelly beans is 900.  We need to find the volume of the jar that can be occupied by 900 red jelly beans.  Since each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, the volume occupied by 900 jelly beans is 900 * 0.15 = 135 cubic inches.  The total volume of the jar is 540 cubic inches, and 80% of it can be occupied by jelly beans, which is 540 * 0.8 = 432 cubic inches.  The ratio of the volume occupied by 900 red jelly beans to the total volume that can be occupied by jelly beans is 135 / 432 = 0.3125.  Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the ratio of red jelly beans to total jelly beans is 0.3.  We can set up a proportion to find the total number of jelly beans: 0.3 / 1 = 0.3125 / x, where x is the total number of jelly beans.  Solving for x, we get x = 1 / 0.3125 = 3.2.  Since the jar can hold 4500 jelly beans, Tim's estimated number of red jelly beans is 3.2 * 1350 = 4320.

The difference between Tim's estimated number of red jelly beans and the true number is 4320 - 900 = 3420.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3420}$"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, the bus had 20 people.
2. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.
3. At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop (40) entered the bus. This means 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered the bus at the second stop. So, the total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.
4. At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

Now, we need to find the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus. The bus has a capacity of 200 people, and there are 180 people on the bus. 

The number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 200 - 180 = 20.

"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost of visits for the first 5 years and the cost of visits for the next 3 years.

For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit is $2. Since Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, the annual cost is 3 * $2 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 5 * $6 = $30.

The cost of one visit has increased by 150% after 5 years. This means the new cost of one visit is 2 + (150% of 2) = 2 + (1.5 * 2) = 2 + 3 = $5.

For the next 3 years, the annual cost is 3 * $5 = $15. For 3 years, the total cost is 3 * $15 = $45.

The total cost for all visits is $30 + $45 = $75.

"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length can be represented as 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece, we can find the length of the longer piece by multiplying x by 4:

Longer piece = 4x = 4(8) = 32

"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound to find the total pounds of meat needed.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Now that we know Aiden needs 5 pounds of meat, we can find out how much seasoning he needs. He adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat.

Total pounds of meat needed = 5
Seasoning per pound = 2 tablespoons

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat needed * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let C be the number of cupcakes Carly made and B be the number of brownies she made.

We know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, so we can write an equation:

B = 3C - 2

We also know that each person gets 2 treats and there are 5 people in the class, so the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

Since the total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, we can write another equation:

C + B = 10

Now we can substitute the expression for B from the first equation into the second equation:

C + (3C - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:

4C - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:

4C = 12

Divide both sides by 4:

C = 3

"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the discount on the manicure and pedicure. 

The original cost of the manicure is $35 and the pedicure is $40. The total cost before the discount is $35 + $40 = $75.

The discount offered is 20% of the total cost. To find 20% of $75, we multiply $75 by 0.20. 
$75 * 0.20 = $15

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the discounted price. 
$75 - $15 = $60

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the nail art. Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers on both hands, the total number of nails is 10. The cost of nail art per nail is $3.

"To find the price of the toy after the discount in January, we need to follow the order of operations.

1. First, we need to find the price of the toy in December after the 80% increase. 
   The original price is $40. 
   An 80% increase means the price is 100% (original) + 80% (increase) = 180% of the original price.
   So, the price in December is 40 * 1.8 = $72.

2. Next, we need to find the price of the toy in January after the 50% decrease from the December price.
   A 50% decrease means the price is 100% (original) - 50% (decrease) = 50% of the original price.
   So, the price in January is 72 * 0.5 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the amount he earns from the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons separately and then add them together.

For the standard rate lessons, Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 per hour. So, the total amount he earns from these lessons is:
4 * $80 = $320

For the reduced rate lessons, Charlie has 2 lessons at a 25% discount on his standard rate. The reduced rate is 75% of the standard rate, which is 0.75 * $80 = $60 per hour. So, the total amount he earns from these lessons is:
2 * $60 = $120

Now, we add the amounts earned from both types of lessons to find the total amount Charlie will make for the day:
$320 + $120 = $440

The final answer is: $440"
"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of scores.

First, let's add up the scores: 
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

The sum of the scores is 630.

Next, we need to count the total number of scores, which is 9.

Now, we divide the sum by the total number of scores to find the mean:
630 ÷ 9 = 70

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to first determine what 1/4 of the original amount is. 

Since Eve had 20 pieces of pomelos originally, 1/4 of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5. 

This means Eve was left with 5 pomelos. 

To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to subtract the number of pomelos she was left with from the original amount. 

20 (original amount) - 5 (amount left) = 15

So, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the number of apples Walter ate, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60. 

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, we need to find the remaining number of apples. 

Remaining apples = Total apples - Apples eaten
Remaining apples = 60 - 24 = 36

Now, we need to find 25% of the remaining apples to determine how many he gave to his sister.

25% of 36 = (25/100) * 36 = 0.25 * 36 = 9

So, Walter gave 9 apples to his sister. Now, we need to find the remaining number of apples.

Remaining apples = Total remaining apples - Apples given to sister
Remaining apples = 36 - 9 = 27

Now, we need to find the total money Walter received by selling the remaining apples at $3 each.

Total money received = Number of remaining apples * Price per apple
Total money received = 27 * 3 = 81

The final answer is: $81"
"To find the total number of novels Regina wrote this year, we need to determine what 1 quarter of the novels is and then multiply it by 4.

Since 9 novels is 3 quarters, we can find 1 quarter by dividing 9 by 3.

"To find the total distance covered by Michael in 3 days, we need to calculate the distance he covers in one day and then multiply it by 3.

First, let's convert the speed from km/hr to km/day:
Speed = 50 km/hr
Time = 24 hours (in a day)
Distance covered in one day = Speed * Time = 50 km/hr * 24 hr = 1200 km/day

Now, let's calculate the total distance covered in 3 days:
Total distance covered = Distance covered in one day * 3
= 1200 km/day * 3
= 3600 km

Now, let's find the percentage of the distance covered:
Percentage covered = (Total distance covered / Total distance between Alaska and Texas) * 100
= (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
= 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.
2. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass, so he used 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.
3. The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.
4. Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Each pie requires 12 grapes, so the total number of grapes used by their mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.
5. The total number of grapes used by all three is 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.
6. Since Madeline ate 6 grapes initially, the total number of grapes at the beginning is 84 + 6 = 90 grapes.

"To find out how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate the total cost per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

The cost of pasta per week is $1.00.
The cost of cheddar cheese per week is $3.00.
The cost of gruyere cheese per week is twice the cost of cheddar cheese, which is 2 * $3.00 = $6.00.

The total cost of cheese per week is $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00.
The total cost per week is $1.00 (pasta) + $9.00 (cheese) = $10.00.

There are 52 weeks in a year. 
The total cost per year is $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520.00"
"To find the total number of minutes the custodian works in a day, we multiply the number of hours they work by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes/day

The total number of minutes the custodian needs to clean all classrooms is the product of the number of classrooms and the minutes per classroom.

80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we divide the total minutes spent cleaning by the total minutes worked in a day, and then multiply by 100.

(1200 minutes / 480 minutes/day) * 100 = 250%

The custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning classrooms, which is equivalent to 2.5 times their day.

The final answer is: 250"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of books the middle shelves can hold as 'x'. Since there are two middle shelves, the total number of books they can hold is 2x.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2x books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 2x - 5 books.

The total number of books the bookcase can hold is the sum of the books on all shelves: 2x + 2x + (2x - 5) = 6x - 5.

We know that Elly has 110 books, so we can set up the equation: 6x - 5 = 110.

To solve for x, we add 5 to both sides of the equation: 6x = 115.

Then, we divide both sides by 6: x = 115 / 6.

x = 19.17 (round down to 19 since we can't have a fraction of a bookshelf).

Now that we know x, we can find the total number of books the bookcase can hold: 6x - 5 = 6(19) - 5 = 113.

Since Elly has 110 books, she needs 1 bookcase to hold all of them.

However, the question asks for the number of bookcases needed to hold all of her books. Since 1 bookcase can hold 113 books, and she has 110 books, she actually needs 1 bookcase.

"To find Rose's profit, we first need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The cost of 5 dozens of eggs is 5 * $2.40 = $12.

Since 1 dozen has 12 eggs, 5 dozens will have 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

Rose will sell each egg for $1 for 3 eggs, so the selling price per egg is $1 / 3 = $0.33.

The total revenue from selling 60 eggs is 60 * $0.33 = $20.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $20 - $12 = $8.

"To find the number of white hats, we first need to find the number of red and blue hats.

Half of the hats are red, so the number of red hats is 100 * 1/2 = 50.

The remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50.

3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, so the number of blue hats is 50 * 3/5 = 30.

The rest of the hats are white, so the number of white hats is 50 - 30 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first calculate the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

Original price per bag: $18.00
Discount: $3.00
Discounted price per bag: $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can find the cost per stick by dividing the discounted price by the number of sticks.

Cost per stick: $15.00 / 30 = $0.50

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100 (since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents).

Cost per stick in cents: $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents

"To find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to find out how many questions she needs to get right in total. 

Let's start by finding out how many questions she got right on the first test. Since she got 60% of 70 questions correct, we can calculate this as:

60% of 70 = 0.6 * 70 = 42

Now, let's find out how many questions she needs to get right in total to pass. Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct, and the total number of questions is 70 + 40 = 110, we can calculate this as:

70% of 110 = 0.7 * 110 = 77

Since she got 42 questions right on the first test, she needs to get 77 - 42 = 35 questions right on the second test.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B. We are given that B = 5S - 4. We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so S + B = 116.

We can substitute the expression for B into the second equation: S + (5S - 4) = 116.

Combine like terms: 6S - 4 = 116.

Add 4 to both sides: 6S = 120.

Divide both sides by 6: S = 20.

Now that we know S, we can find B: B = 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

"To find out how many marbles Brendan ended up with, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Brendan had 10 marbles.

He dropped half of them, so he lost 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. This means he had 10 - 5 = 5 marbles left.

Then, he found 3 more marbles, so now he has 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.

However, one of the marbles he picked up was a bead, not a marble. So, he got rid of 1 marble.

Now, we subtract 1 from 8 to get the final number of marbles: 8 - 1 = 7.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the house, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Next, let's calculate the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of 8 rooms is 4 rooms. So, 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, which is 4 * 4 = 16 small candles. The other 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each, which is 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles. 

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

"To find the total cost of the phone plan, we need to determine the cost of the additional phones and add it to the cost of the main phone.

Let's assume the cost of each additional phone is x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We know that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

The total cost of the phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones:

Total cost = 20 + 40

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the total number of people he saw on the first three days and add it to the total number of people he saw on the remaining days.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the number of people on the second day is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day, so the number of people on the third day is 2 * 70 = 140.

The total number of people on the first three days is 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, the total number of people he saw on the remaining days is 60 * 4 = 240.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
3. So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 1.5 minutes is 20 + 60 = 80 kernels.
4. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to four times the initial rate, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.
5. So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 2 minutes is 80 + 80 = 160 kernels.
6. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds, which is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.
7. So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 2.5 minutes is 160 + 40 = 200 kernels.
8. After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. This is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.
9. Therefore, the total number of kernels that popped is 200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

"To find out how many lemons Tim will need, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemonade he will make, including the extra gallon for Allen. 

Since Tim will make 4 gallons of lemonade and 1 extra gallon, he will make a total of 5 gallons. 

Since 1 gallon of lemonade requires 1 cup of lemon juice, 5 gallons will require 5 cups of lemon juice.

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we need to find out how many lemons will yield 5 cups of juice. 

To do this, we can set up a proportion: 6 lemons / 1 cup = x lemons / 5 cups. 

We can then cross-multiply to solve for x: 6 * 5 = 1 * x, which gives us 30 = x.

Therefore, Tim will need 30 lemons.

Distance = 18 * 5 = 90 miles

For the second part of the journey (east), Elvis travels for 8 hours at 18mph:
Distance = 18 * 8 = 144 miles

Since Elvis is traveling in the opposite direction, we need to subtract the distance traveled in the first part from the distance traveled in the second part to find the net distance from his house:
Net distance = 144 - 90 = 54 miles

The final answer is: 54"
"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and subtract it from the initial value.

Initial value of the boat = $9000

Depreciation in the first year = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after the first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Depreciation in the second year = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after the second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Depreciation in the third year = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after the third year = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The final value of the boat after three years is $3528."
"To find the number of pink candies, we first need to determine the number of orange and yellow candies. 

We are given that there are 54 red candies. Since there are twice as many orange candies as red candies, the number of orange candies is 2 * 54 = 108.

We are also given that there are half as many yellow candies as red candies. So, the number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, we know the total number of candies is 232. We can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total.

Number of pink candies = Total number of candies - (Number of red candies + Number of orange candies + Number of yellow candies)
= 232 - (54 + 108 + 27)
= 232 - 189

"To find the total weight of the car, luggage, and children, we need to add their individual weights together. 

Total weight = weight of the car + weight of luggage + weight of children
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + (2 * 75)
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Since the force to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we need to find 1% of 1600.

1% of 1600 = (1/100) * 1600
1% of 1600 = 0.01 * 1600
1% of 1600 = 16

The force John needs to push the car is 16 pounds."

"To find out how much feed is left, we first need to calculate how much feed the pigs eat in a day and then multiply it by 7 to find out how much they eat in a week.

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so each pig eats 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of feed per day.

Since Dexter has 5 pigs, the total amount of feed they eat in a day is 5 * 8 = 40 pounds.

To find out how much they eat in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7: 40 * 7 = 280 pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so to find out how much is left, we subtract the amount eaten from the total amount ordered: 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

"To find out how many hot dogs John needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the party. 

The number of guests is 20, and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs, so the total number of hot dogs needed is 20 * 2 = 40.

However, John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. So, the total number of hot dogs he needs to buy is 40 - 4 = 36.

Since a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2, we need to find out how many packs John needs to buy. 

To do this, we divide the total number of hot dogs needed by the number of hot dogs in a pack: 36 / 6 = 6.

Since each pack costs $2, the total amount John needs to spend on hot dogs is 6 * 2 = 12.

"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

For the T-shirts, Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a buy one get one 50% off deal. This means that one T-shirt is at full price and the other is 50% off. 

The original price of each T-shirt is $8. 
The full-priced T-shirt costs $8.
The discounted T-shirt costs 50% off of $8, which is 0.5 * $8 = $4.
So, the total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

For the shoes, the original price is $40 and they are 40% off. 
The discount on the shoes is 40% of $40, which is 0.4 * $40 = $16.
The sale price of the shoes is the original price minus the discount, which is $40 - $16 = $24.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many holes the dog digs in total and then subtract the number of holes Nate fills in per day from the number of holes the dog digs per day to find the net number of holes left to fill each day.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is 6 * 14 = 84.

Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night, so the net number of holes left to fill each day is 6 - 9 = -3. However, since we can't have a negative number of holes, this means that Nate is actually filling in more holes than the dog is digging. 

To find the number of days it takes to fill in all the holes, we need to find the number of days it takes to fill in the initial 84 holes. Since Nate fills in 3 more holes than the dog digs each day, the number of holes left to fill decreases by 3 each day. 

The number of days it takes to fill in the holes is 84 / 3 = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the number of weeks it takes to fill in all the holes is 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

Combine like terms:

24 + B = 29

Subtract 24 from both sides:

B = 5

However, we know that Igor initially picked up the correct number of beakers (7), but lost some on the way. So, the number of beakers Igor lost is the difference between the initial number of beakers and the number of beakers he had on the lab bench:

Beakers lost = 7 - B = 7 - 5 = 2

2. Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, so if Aaron runs 4 miles, Vanessa runs 2 * 4 = 8 miles.
3. Since Aaron runs at a speed of 2V miles per minute and completes his part of the race in 16 minutes, we can set up the equation: 2V * 16 = 4.
4. Solving for V, we get V = 4 / 16 = 1/4 miles per minute.
5. Now that we know Vanessa's speed, we can find the time it took her to complete her part of the race: time = distance / speed = 8 / (1/4) = 8 * 4 = 32 minutes.

"To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of line required for the existing dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, we multiply 200 by 3.

200 * 3 = 600

This means he needs 600 feet of line for the existing dock. Since he already has 6 feet of new line, we need to subtract that from the total amount needed.

600 - 6 = 594

So, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total.

594"
"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate their daily revenue and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

First, let's calculate the daily revenue:

- Number of reservations per night: 6
- Meals per reservation: 2
- Cost of each meal: $5
- Total cost of meals per reservation: 2 * $5 = $10
- Cost of wine per reservation: $5
- Total cost per reservation: $10 + $5 = $15
- Daily revenue: 6 reservations * $15 = $90

Now, let's calculate the weekly revenue:

- Number of days open per week: 2
- Weekly revenue: $90 * 2 = $180

The final answer is: $180"
"To find the cost price of each watermelon, we first need to find the total cost of the watermelons. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price of each watermelon is $80 / 50 = $1.60.

Now, the vendor sold the watermelons at a profit of 25%. This means the selling price is 125% of the cost price (100% of the cost price + 25% profit). 

Let's calculate the selling price of each watermelon: 
Selling price = 1.25 * Cost price
Selling price = 1.25 * $1.60
Selling price = $2

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then determine the age of John's youngest son.

First, let's find James' current age. We know that James is now twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. This means that Dora's current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

Now, we know that John had James when he was 19. This means that John's current age is 19 + (James' current age) = 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son's current age is 37 - 32 = 5 years.

In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many oranges Ana and Jane can peel in an hour. 

First, let's find out how many minutes are in an hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour.

Since Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, in 60 minutes, she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Since Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, in 60 minutes, she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

Now, to find out how many more oranges Ana has peeled than Jane, we subtract the number of oranges Jane peeled from the number of oranges Ana peeled: 20 - 15 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. 

The original cost of the radiator is $400. Mark gets it for 80% off, which means he pays 20% of the original cost. 

20% of $400 is calculated as 0.20 * 400 = $80.

So, Mark pays $80 for the radiator.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic works for 3 hours at $50 an hour. 

The total cost of hiring the mechanic is 3 * 50 = $150.

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of hiring the mechanic to find the total cost.

Total cost = $80 (radiator) + $150 (mechanic) = $230.

The final answer is: $230"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation:

C + W = 20

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, so we can write the equation:

2C + 4W = 70

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by 2 to get:

2C + 2W = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate C:

(2C + 4W) - (2C + 2W) = 70 - 40
2W = 30

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

W = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of chickens:

C + 15 = 20
C = 5

Therefore, there are 5 chickens on the farm.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, let's find the total number of slices. There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. 

Total number of slices = 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

There are 4 people in total, including Henry and his 3 friends. 

Number of people = 4

Now, let's divide the total number of slices by the number of people to find out how many slices each person can have.

Slices per person = Total number of slices / Number of people
= 56 slices / 4 people
= 14 slices/person

The final answer is: 14"
