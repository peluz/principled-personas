"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to determine how many eggs she has left after eating and baking, and then multiply that number by the price per egg.

Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 eggs for muffins, so she uses a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs.

Since she lays 16 eggs per day, we subtract the eggs she uses from the total number of eggs laid: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

Janet sells these 9 eggs at $2 each, so she makes 9 x $2 = $18 per day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts needed for the robe, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, we can calculate the white fiber as 2 / 2 = 1 bolt.

Now, we add the blue fiber and white fiber together: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit Josh made, we first need to determine the total value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

To find the new value of the house, we can set up the equation: 

New Value = Original Value + (Original Value * 150%)

New Value = $80,000 + ($80,000 * 1.5)
New Value = $80,000 + $120,000
New Value = $200,000

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost (purchase price + repairs) from the new value of the house.

Total Cost = Purchase Price + Repairs
Total Cost = $80,000 + $50,000
Total Cost = $130,000

Profit = New Value - Total Cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

The final answer is: $70,000"
"To find the total number of meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he has in a week.

Since James runs 3 sprints in one session, and each sprint is 60 meters, the total meters he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James runs 3 sessions a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to determine the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals. 

In the morning, Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives them another 25 cups of feed. So, the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per day, and she has 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed per day is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

Now, to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total amount of feed needed per day. 

60 (total feed needed per day) - 40 (feed given in morning and afternoon) = 20 cups.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. The first glass costs $5. 

The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 

The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * $3 = $1.8. 

We can see that the cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of the previous glass's cost. 

The sequence of the cost of the glasses is: $5, $3, $1.8, $1.08, $0.64, $0.384, $0.2304, $0.13824, $0.0829376, $0.04956256, $0.029837696, $0.017913216, $0.0107481296, $0.00644392768, $0.003826286112, $0.0022957738672, $0.00137746593024.

To find the total cost, we need to sum up the cost of all the glasses. 

The sum of the cost of the glasses is approximately $5 + $3 + $1.8 + $1.08 + $0.64 + $0.384 + $0.2304 + $0.13824 + $0.0829376 + $0.04956256 + $0.029837696 + $0.017913216 + $0.0107481296 + $0.00644392768 + $0.003826286112 + $0.0022957738672 + $0.00137746593024 â‰ˆ $24.01.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in each city: 20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260.

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, let's find out how long it would take Carla to download the file normally. Since she can download 2 GB/minute, we can divide the total size of the file (200 GB) by her download speed (2 GB/minute).

200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes

However, 40% of the way through the download, Windows forces a restart. To find out how much of the file Carla has downloaded at this point, we can multiply the total size of the file by 0.4 (40% as a decimal).

200 GB * 0.4 = 80 GB

So, Carla has downloaded 80 GB of the file. Now, she has to restart the download from the beginning. This means she has to download the entire 200 GB again.

Since she can download 2 GB/minute, we can divide the total size of the file (200 GB) by her download speed (2 GB/minute) to find out how long it takes to download the file again.

200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes

However, we also need to add the 20 minutes it takes for Windows to install updates. 

Total time = 100 minutes (first download) + 20 minutes (update time) + 100 minutes (second download)
Total time = 220 minutes

The final answer is: 220"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the distance traveled in each segment.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. The distance traveled in this segment is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles

Then, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is traveled in this segment.

Next, he drives for 0.5 hours (half an hour) at 30 mph. The distance traveled in this segment is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 mph * 0.5 hours = 15 miles

Finally, he drives for the remaining 1.5 hours (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours) at 80 mph. The distance traveled in this segment is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 mph * 1.5 hours = 120 miles

The total distance traveled is the sum of the distances in each segment:
Total Distance = 180 miles + 0 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 315 miles

However, since John is trying to get home, we need to subtract the distance he traveled from the initial distance. Unfortunately, the initial distance is not given, so we can't calculate the exact distance from home. But we can calculate the distance he traveled in the last 4 hours.

The distance he traveled in the last 4 hours is the sum of the distances in the last two segments:
Distance = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles

Since he spent 2 hours in standstill traffic, we need to add the distance he would have traveled in that time at 80 mph:
Distance = 80 mph * 2 hours = 160 miles

The total distance he traveled in the last 4 hours is:
Total Distance = 135 miles + 160 miles = 295 miles

However, this is not the answer we are looking for. We are looking for the distance from home at the end of those 4 hours. Since he spent 2 hours in standstill traffic, he is still 2 hours away from home at the end of those 4 hours. 

The distance he would have traveled in the last 2 hours at 80 mph is:
Distance = 80 mph * 2 hours = 160 miles

The distance from home at the end of those 4 hours is the distance he traveled in the last 2 hours:
Distance from home = 160 miles"
"To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately, then add them together.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so her overtime rate is $10 * 1.2 = $12/hour. Her overtime earnings are 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

Her total earnings for the week are $400 + $60 = $460.

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and then add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it's 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. Then, we subtract 54 from 180 to get 126 downloads in the third month.

Now, we add the downloads from each month: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the donuts: 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen is 3 x $68 = $204.

Next, let's find the cost of the mini cupcakes: 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen is 2 x $80 = $160.

Now, let's find the cost of the mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen is 6 x $55 = $330.

Finally, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of planting the tree and the annual expenses, and then find the point at which the total earnings from selling lemons exceed these costs.

The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. The annual expenses for watering and feeding the tree are $3. 

Each year, the tree will grow 7 lemons, which can be sold for $1.5 each, resulting in a total annual revenue of 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.

To find the break-even point, we need to calculate the total cost of the tree and the total annual expenses, and then find the point at which the total earnings from selling lemons exceed these costs.

Let's denote the number of years as 'n'. The total cost of the tree is $90, and the total annual expenses are $3. The total earnings from selling lemons after 'n' years will be $10.5 * n.

The break-even point can be found by setting up the equation:

Total cost + Total annual expenses * n = Total earnings from lemons

90 + 3n = 10.5n

Subtracting 3n from both sides:

90 = 7.5n

Dividing both sides by 7.5:

n = 12

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume Melanie started with 'x' vacuum cleaners.

At the green house, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners, which is x/3.

At the red house, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners.

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which is (x - x/3 - 2).

We know that after selling at all the houses, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

To simplify the equation, let's first find a common denominator for the fractions:

x - x/3 - 2 - (2x - 2x/3 - 4)/2

Combine like terms:

x - x/3 - 2 - (4x/3 - 2)/2

Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the fractions:

6x - 2x - 12 - (4x - 2)/2

Combine like terms:

4x - 12 - 2x + 1

Simplify:

2x - 11

Now, set the equation equal to 30 (since 6 * 5 = 30):

2x - 11 = 30

Add 11 to both sides:

2x = 41

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20.5

However, since Melanie can't sell a fraction of a vacuum cleaner, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

x = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, and then subtract that from the total number of students.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20 * 0.2 = 4 students

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
16 * 0.25 = 4 students

The number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is the remaining students after subtracting the students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance:
16 - 4 = 12 students

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the maximum profit, we need to calculate the potential increase in value for both options and then compare them.

For the jewelry option, the potential increase in value is 2.5% of $5,000:
2.5% of $5,000 = 0.025 * $5,000 = $125

For the electronic gadgets option, the potential increase in value is 1.2% of $8,000:
1.2% of $8,000 = 0.012 * $8,000 = $96

Since the jewelry option has a higher potential increase in value ($125 vs $96), the merchant should choose the jewelry option to maximize profit.

The profit would be the potential increase in value of the chosen option, which is $125."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered on the first day and the distance covered on the second day.

On the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance. 

On the second day, they travel 150 miles northward. Again, since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance.

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:

She works 35 hours a week as a teacher and gets paid $20 per hour. Since she works 50 weeks a year, her total hours worked as a teacher in a year is:
35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year

Her earnings from teaching in a year is:
1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:

She works 15 hours a week as a coach and gets paid $30 per hour. Since she works 50 weeks a year, her total hours worked as a coach in a year is:
15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year

Her earnings from coaching in a year is:
750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
$35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To find out how many eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week and then multiply it by 4.

Since Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. 

There are 7 days in a week, so she eats 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week.

In 4 weeks, she will eat 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she will eat in 4 weeks.

84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much time Marissa has left to walk the remaining distance. 

She has walked 4 miles in 1 hour and 2 miles in another hour, so she has walked a total of 6 miles in 2 hours. 

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles, and she has already walked 6 miles, so she has 12 - 6 = 6 miles left to walk.

Since she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, and the total distance is 12 miles, she needs to walk the entire 12 miles in 12 / 4 = 3 hours.

She has already walked for 2 hours, so she has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left to walk the remaining 6 miles.

To find her required speed, we divide the remaining distance by the remaining time: 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total amount of water in the orange drink, we first need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, this means 6.67 liters of the orange drink is water.

Next, we calculate the total amount of water in the pineapple drink, which is three-fifths of 15 liters. Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we subtract the 1 liter that was spilled from the orange drink. So, the remaining water from the orange drink is 6.67 - 1 = 5.67 liters.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is the sum of the water from the orange drink and the pineapple drink. This is 5.67 + 9 = 14.67 liters.

The final answer is: 14.67"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha.
2. Samantha is now 31 years old.
3. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old.
4. Raymond had a son at the age of 23.
5. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to subtract the age at which Raymond had a son from his current age. 
   Raymond's current age is 25, and he had a son at 23, so the son was born 25 - 23 = 2 years ago.

"To find the total number of DVDs sold by Billy, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so the total number of DVDs sold to them is 3 * 1 = 3.

The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so the total number of DVDs sold to them is 2 * 2 = 4.

The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so the total number of DVDs sold to them is 0.

Now, we add the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers: 3 + 4 = 7.

So, the total number of DVDs sold by Billy on Tuesday is 7.

"To find out how many centimeters shorter the candle will be, we need to calculate the total time it burns and then multiply it by the rate at which it melts.

The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is a total of 4 hours.

Since the candle melts 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the total hours by the melting rate:

4 hours * 2 centimeters/hour = 8 centimeters

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the original price of the book, we need to determine the amount of the discount and add it to the discounted price. 

First, let's find the amount of the discount: 
Discount = 25% of the original price
Let's denote the original price as 'x'. 
Then, the discount is 0.25x.

The discounted price is the original price minus the discount: 
Discounted price = x - 0.25x = 0.75x

We know the discounted price is $19.50. 
So, we can set up the equation: 
0.75x = 19.50

To find 'x', we need to divide both sides by 0.75: 
x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To find the total cost of the items Marie ordered, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken meal, the milk, and the apples, and then subtract that from the total amount she paid.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of the milk is 5 packs * $3 per pack = $15.
The cost of the apples is 4 apples * $1.50 per apple = $6.

The total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

To find the number of boxes of pizza, we need to divide the cost of the pizza boxes by the cost per box: $17 / $8.50 = 2.

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she buys and then multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will go through 60 servings in 60 days. Each carton has 15 servings, so we need to divide 60 by 15 to find out how many cartons she buys:

60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Now, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton:

4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

So, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

First, let's find the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip. Since Henry's second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip is 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

Now, we know that Henry's first stop was after 20 miles. So, the distance from the first stop to the second stop is 45 - 20 = 25 miles.

"Let's break down the information given. We know that one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, which means the second pair costs 2 * $33 = $66. 

The total cost of the two pairs of heels is $33 + $66 = $99. We are also told that the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. 

Let's represent the cost of the boots as 'x'. Since the two pairs of heels cost five dollars less than the boots, we can write the equation: x - 5 = 99.

To find the cost of the boots, we need to solve for 'x'. We can do this by adding 5 to both sides of the equation: x = 99 + 5.

x = 104

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given ratio of their ages. Let's assume Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x, where x is a common multiplier.

We know that the total of their ages is 162, so we can write the equation: 7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age: Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the total number of guesses and divide by the number of friends.

The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first one, which is (80 / 2) + 20 = 60.
The third friend guesses 25% more than the first one, which is 80 + (80 * 0.25) = 100.

Now, let's add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

There are 3 friends, so we divide the total by 3 to find the average: 240 / 3 = 80.

"To find the total hours John spends taking care of dogs in a week, we need to first calculate the total hours he spends per day. 

Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day, and John has 10 dogs. So, the total hours per day is 0.5 * 10 = 5 hours.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the total hours per day by 7 to get the total hours per week. 

5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

The final answer is: 35"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's represent the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'.

We know that the total number of coins is 110, which is the sum of the number of gold and silver coins. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

Since x represents the number of silver coins, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"

"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes separately, then add them together.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which is 1. Then, we add this to the original 4 points to get the total points scored in the second 20 minutes: 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The total points Mike scored is 9.

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to first determine how many yogurts he eats in 30 days and then calculate the cost.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. In 30 days, he will eat 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The sale is 4 yogurts for $5.00. To find the cost of one yogurt, we divide the total cost by the number of yogurts: $5.00 / 4 = $1.25 per yogurt.

Now, we multiply the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days by the cost per yogurt: 60 * $1.25 = $75.00.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To find out how many LEGO sets John still has, we need to first calculate how much money he made from selling the LEGO sets and then subtract the money he spent on video games and the remaining amount he has.

John sold 13 LEGO sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is:
13 LEGO sets * $15 per set = $195

He then bought 8 video games for $20 each, so the total amount of money he spent on video games is:
8 video games * $20 per game = $160

After buying the video games, he had $5 left. To find out how much money he spent in total, we subtract the remaining amount from the total amount he made:
$195 - $5 = $190

Now, we subtract the money he spent on video games from the total amount he spent:
$190 - $160 = $30

This means he spent $30 on something else, but we don't know what. However, we are asked to find out how many LEGO sets he still has. Since we know he made $195 and spent $30, we can find out how many LEGO sets he sold for $30:
$30 / $15 per set = 2 LEGO sets

So, John sold 2 LEGO sets for $30. To find out how many LEGO sets he still has, we subtract the number of sets he sold from the total number of sets he had:
13 LEGO sets - 2 LEGO sets = 11 LEGO sets

The final answer is: 11"
"To find John's running speed, we first need to calculate the total hours he runs per week. 

He runs 3 hours on the first day. The other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours per day. 

So, the total hours he runs per week is 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours.

Now, we know John runs 60 miles a week and 6 hours a week. To find his speed, we divide the total miles by the total hours: 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's walking speed. Since she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, and she can skip at 3 miles per hour, we can find her running speed by multiplying her skipping speed by 2. 

Her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Since she can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, we can find her walking speed by dividing her running speed by 4.

Her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, we know that she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, in six hours, she will spend 2 hours running and 4 hours walking.

The distance she travels while running is her running speed multiplied by the time she spends running: 6 * 2 = 12 miles.

The distance she travels while walking is her walking speed multiplied by the time she spends walking: 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles.

The total distance she can travel in six hours is the sum of the distances she travels while running and walking: 12 + 6 = 18 miles.

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.
2. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, so Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.
3. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, so Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone and then subtract the dragon's reach from that distance.

When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. Since she can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, she can throw it 3 * 400 = 1200 feet with the gemstone.

The dragon's flames reach 1000 feet. To find the distance outside the dragon's reach where Polly can still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw with the gemstone: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

The final answer is: 200"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests. We know that Grandma Jones baked 5 pies and cut each pie into 8 pieces, so the total number of pieces is 5 x 8 = 40. 

Since there were 14 pieces remaining at the end of the evening, we can subtract 14 from the total number of pieces to find out how many were taken by the guests. 

40 - 14 = 26

So, the guests took 26 pieces of pie. 

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to determine how many calories you have left to consume. 

Your daily calorie target is 2000, and you have already consumed 1800 calories. 

2000 (daily target) - 1800 (already consumed) = 200 calories left

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, we need to find out how many servings you can have within your remaining calorie limit.

200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, we need to find out how many grams are in one serving.

300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving

Now, we can multiply the number of servings you can have by the grams per serving to find out how many grams you can eat.

0.8 servings * 60g per serving = 48g

The final answer is: 48"
"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

First, let's find the total cost. Since one pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00, and Charlie makes 10 candles per pound, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles. The total cost of the beeswax and wicks for 20 candles is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.

Next, let's find the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles, so the total revenue is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

Now, let's find the net profit. The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. So, the net profit is $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we first need to determine the number of articles she wrote each day.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. To find this, we multiply the number of articles she wrote on Monday by 2/5 and add it to the original number of articles.

2/5 * 5 = 2
5 + 2 = 7

So, on Tuesday, Meredith wrote 7 articles.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. To find this, we multiply the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday by 2.

7 * 2 = 14

Now that we know the number of articles she wrote each day, we can find the total number of articles she wrote in the three days.

5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, we can find the total number of hours she spent writing articles by multiplying the total number of articles by the time it takes to write each article.

26 * 4 = 104

The final answer is: 104"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many Post-it notes Candice had after placing one on each of the 220 cups of coffee. We know she had 80 initially and had 23 remaining after placing the notes on the cups. 

First, let's find out how many Post-it notes Candice used at the coffee shop. This can be calculated by subtracting the remaining Post-it notes from the initial amount: 80 - 23 = 57. 

Since she placed one note on each of the 220 cups, the total number of Post-it notes used at the coffee shop is 220. However, we know that 57 were used in total, so the remaining Post-it notes must have come from the package she purchased. 

Now, let's find out how many Post-it notes were in the package. This can be calculated by subtracting the Post-it notes used at the coffee shop from the total used: 220 - 57 = 163. 

However, this is the number of Post-it notes used from the package, not the total number of Post-it notes in the package. Since Candice purchased a package, we can assume that the package was not empty. Therefore, the total number of Post-it notes in the package must be more than 163. 

To find the total number of Post-it notes in the package, we need to add the remaining Post-it notes to the number of Post-it notes used from the package: 163 + 23 = 186.

The final answer is: 186"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. To find the number of blue ties, we can divide the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost per tie:

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

Now, we know that the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. This means the cost of a red tie is 1.5 times the cost of a blue tie:

Cost of a red tie = 1.5 * Cost of a blue tie
= 1.5 * $40
= $60

To find the total amount spent on red ties, we multiply the number of red ties by the cost per red tie:

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

The total amount spent on ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches, since the pieces are 6 inches long. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the total length of the wire in inches is 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.

Now, we can divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces Tracy obtained: 48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of units in the building, we need to multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor. 

Number of floors: 15
Number of units per floor: 8

Total units = Number of floors * Number of units per floor
Total units = 15 * 8
Total units = 120

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total units to determine the number of unoccupied units.

1/4 of the total units = (1/4) * Total units
1/4 of the total units = (1/4) * 120
1/4 of the total units = 30

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we first need to calculate how much he makes per day and then multiply it by 7.

First, let's find out how many eggs Lloyd sells per day. Since he sells eggs by the dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs produced by 12 to find out how many dozens he sells per day.

Eggs produced per day: 252
Eggs sold per day (in dozens): 252 / 12 = 21 dozen

Now, let's calculate Lloyd's daily income from egg sales.

Price per dozen: $2
Eggs sold per day (in dozens): 21
Daily income: 21 * $2 = $42

To find out Lloyd's weekly income, we multiply his daily income by 7.

Weekly income: $42 * 7 = $294

The final answer is: $294"
"To find the total time Tom spends traveling, we first need to calculate the time he spends traveling from 1 to 4 PM. Since he travels at 10 miles per hour, we can assume he travels for 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours). 

Now, we need to find the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Distance = Speed * Time. So, distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles.

Now, we need to find the time he takes to travel back. We know the distance is 30 miles and his speed is 6 miles per hour. Time = Distance / Speed. So, time = 30 miles / 6 miles/hour = 5 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * (1/4) = 7.5 pounds.

Since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, and the comic books already account for 7.5 pounds, the remaining weight to be removed is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can find the number of toys to be removed by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / (1/2) = 7.5 * 2 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total revenue for each day, we need to calculate the revenue from truck tires and car tires separately and then add them together.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires at $60 each and 4 car tires at $40 each. The total revenue from truck tires on Thursday is 6 * $60 = $360. The total revenue from car tires on Thursday is 4 * $40 = $160. The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires at $40 each and no truck tires. The total revenue from car tires on Friday is 12 * $40 = $480. Since there were no truck tires repaired, the total revenue on Friday is $480.

To find the day with higher revenue, we compare the revenues: $520 (Thursday) and $480 (Friday). Thursday has higher revenue.

Now, to find how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we subtract the lower revenue from the higher revenue: $520 - $480 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of kittens, we first need to determine the number of kittens each cat has had. 

Patchy, the first cat, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens. Since the Doubtfire sisters adopted 7 kittens, Patchy has had 3 * 7 = 21 kittens.

Trixie, the other cat, has had 12 kittens.

Now, we add the number of adopted kittens (7) to the number of kittens each cat has had: 7 (adopted) + 21 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 40.

The Doubtfire family now has 40 kittens.

"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to first determine the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after the truck and driver are on it. 

The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. The weight limit of the bridge is 5000 pounds. 

Remaining weight capacity = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds.

Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we can divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of each box to find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded.

Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15 = 83.

The final answer is: 83"
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to first calculate the total cost after the delivery vendor's fee. 

The original bill was $40.00. The vendor added a 25% fee, which is 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00. So, the new total is $40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00.

Then, the delivery fee of $3.00 is added to this total, making it $50.00 + $3.00 = $53.00.

Finally, Stephen added a $4.00 tip to this total, making the final price $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."

"To find the number of good oranges, we first need to find the total number of unripe and bad oranges. 

There are 1 bad oranges and 20% of 25 oranges are unripe. 
20% of 25 = (20/100) * 25 = 5 oranges are unripe.

Now, we know that 2 oranges are sour. 
So, the total number of unripe, bad, and sour oranges = 5 (unripe) + 1 (bad) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges.

Now, we can find the number of good oranges by subtracting the total number of unripe, bad, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges.
Number of good oranges = Total number of oranges - Total number of unripe, bad, and sour oranges
= 25 - 8
= 17

To find the cost of the insurance, we need to calculate 10% of $1300.
10% of $1300 is 0.1 x $1300 = $130.

The total cost including insurance is $1300 + $130 = $1430.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the value of the pension after 30 years and then find 5% of that value.

First, let's find the total value of the pension after 30 years. Since Marcy works for 30 years, she gets the full pension for 10 years (30 - 20 = 10) and the additional 5% for the remaining 20 years.

The annual pension for the first 10 years is $50,000. 

The annual pension for the next 20 years is 5% of the value of the pension after 10 years. Let's call the value of the pension after 10 years 'x'. Then, the annual pension for the next 20 years is 0.05x.

The total value of the pension after 30 years is the sum of the pensions for the first 10 years and the next 20 years: 10 * $50,000 + 20 * 0.05x.

However, we need to find the value of 'x'. Since the annual pension for the next 20 years is 5% of the value of the pension after 10 years, we can set up the equation: 0.05x = 5% of the value of the pension after 10 years.

The value of the pension after 10 years is the sum of the pensions for the first 10 years: 10 * $50,000 = $500,000.

Now we can find the value of 'x': 0.05x = 5% of $500,000 = 0.05 * $500,000 = $25,000. 

x = $25,000 / 0.05 = $500,000.

Now we can find the total value of the pension after 30 years: 10 * $50,000 + 20 * 0.05 * $500,000 = $500,000 + $50,000 = $550,000.

However, this is the total value of the pension after 30 years. To find the annual pension, we need to divide the total value by 30: $550,000 / 30 = $18,333.33.

The final answer is: $18,333.33"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately, and then add them together.

The streaming service charges $140 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the first half of the year consists of 6 months. 

The total amount paid for the first half of the year is 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, the company charges 10% less than the initial amount. To find the amount charged for the second half, we need to calculate 10% of $140 and subtract it from the initial amount.

10% of $140 = 0.1 * $140 = $14
Amount charged for the second half of the year = $140 - $14 = $126

The total amount paid for the second half of the year is 6 * $126 = $756.

Now, we add the total amount paid for the first half and the second half of the year to get the total amount paid by the end of the year.

Total amount paid = $840 + $756 = $1596

"To determine how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to find out how many miles she can drive per gallon. We know that she has traveled 100 miles since her last fill-up and that it took 4 gallons to fill up her tank again. 

First, let's find out how many miles she can drive per gallon. We can do this by dividing the total distance she has traveled (100 miles) by the amount of gas she used (4 gallons). 

100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know she can drive 25 miles per gallon, we can find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank. We know that her tank holds 12 gallons. 

25 miles per gallon * 12 gallons = 300 miles

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

"To find out how much Shiela will pay each month, we need to calculate the total cost of the cell phones first, then divide it by the number of months.

The total cost of the cell phones is 5 units * $150 per unit = $750.

Since a 2% interest will be charged for each unit, the total interest for 5 units is 5 * 2% = 10% of the total cost.

The interest is 10% of $750 = 0.1 * $750 = $75.

So, the total amount Shiela needs to pay is the cost of the cell phones plus the interest, which is $750 + $75 = $825.

Since Shiela will pay this amount over 3 months, we need to divide the total amount by 3 to find out how much she will pay each month.

$825 / 3 = $275.

The final answer is: $275"
"To find out how much Artie will make, we need to calculate the total revenue from each type of flower and then add them together.

First, let's round the prices to the nearest dollar:
- Marigolds: $2.74 â†’ $3
- Petunias: $1.87 â†’ $2
- Begonias: $2.12 â†’ $2

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from each type of flower:
- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3/pot = $36
- Petunias: 9 pots * $2/pot = $18
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2/pot = $34

Now, let's add the total revenue from each type of flower:
$36 + $18 + $34 = $88

The final answer is: $88"
"To find the average square footage of a level, we need to first find the total square footage of the sandcastle and then divide it by the number of levels.

Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can start with the top level and work our way down. 

The top level has a square footage of 16. 
The second level will have half of 16, which is 8. 
The third level will have half of 8, which is 4. 
The fourth level will have half of 4, which is 2.

Now, we add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30.

There are 4 levels in total. To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels: 30 / 4 = 7.5.

The final answer is: 7.5"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year. 

First, let's find out how many days are in a year. There are 365 days in a year.

The puppy will eat 1 cup of dog food for the first 180 days. So, the amount of dog food used in the first 180 days is 180 cups.

The puppy will eat 2 cups of dog food for the rest of its life, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days. So, the amount of dog food used in the rest of the year is 2 * 185 = 370 cups.

The total amount of dog food used in the first year is 180 + 370 = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year is 550 / 110 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
- Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.
- Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so Raymond does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry.

To find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we subtract the amount David does from the amount Raymond does: 200 - 100 = 100.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 and packages of 2.

For packages of 3: 
- The cost of one package is $2.50.
- To buy 18 flowers, Vincent needs 18 / 3 = 6 packages.
- The total cost is 6 * $2.50 = $15.

For packages of 2:
- The cost of one package is $1.
- To buy 18 flowers, Vincent needs 18 / 2 = 9 packages.
- The total cost is 9 * $1 = $9.

Since $9 is less than $15, the better price is $1 per package.

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of the better price from the cost of the more expensive option: $15 - $9 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find the cost of the grooming after the discount, we need to calculate 30% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

The original price is $100. 
30% of $100 is 0.3 x $100 = $30.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price: $100 - $30 = $70.

The final cost of the grooming is $70.

The final answer is: $70"
"To find out how much water the girls got, we need to calculate 1/6 of 24 liters for each girl. 

1/6 of 24 liters is 24 / 6 = 4 liters. Since there are two girls, they got a total of 4 * 2 = 8 liters.

Now, we subtract the total amount of water the girls got from the initial 24 liters: 24 - 8 = 16 liters.

Then, the boy got 6 liters of water. We subtract this from the remaining 16 liters: 16 - 6 = 10 liters.

So, the amount of water left is 10 liters.

Initially, Charlie had 10 stickers.

He bought 21 stickers from the store, so now he has 10 + 21 = 31 stickers.

He got 23 stickers for his birthday, so now he has 31 + 23 = 54 stickers.

Then, he gave 9 stickers to his sister, so now he has 54 - 9 = 45 stickers.

Finally, he used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so now he has 45 - 28 = 17 stickers.

Therefore, Charlie has 17 stickers left.

First, we multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush: 3 * 25 = 75

Then, we multiply the result by the number of thorns per rose: 75 * 8 = 600

So, there are 600 thorns in total.

600"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of games they lost is x. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is x + 8.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, which is the sum of the games won and lost. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

So, the number of games they lost is 7. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is:

x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the total number of years Gene has been vacationing and multiply it by the number of vacations he goes on per year.

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old and is now 34, so he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since he goes on four vacations a year, the total number of quilt blocks is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 quilt blocks.

The final answer is: 44"
"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of times it rang each time it went off and add them together.

The first time it went off, it rang 4 times.

The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.

The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we add the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to first calculate her salary after five years of service, and then calculate her salary after eight years of service.

Initially, Sylvie's salary is $600. 

After one year, her salary will be 600 + (10% of 600) = 600 + 60 = $660.

After two years, her salary will be 660 + (10% of 660) = 660 + 66 = $726.

After three years, her salary will be 726 + (10% of 726) = 726 + 72.6 = $798.60.

After four years, her salary will be 798.60 + (10% of 798.60) = 798.60 + 79.86 = $878.46.

After five years, her salary will be 878.46 + (10% of 878.46) = 878.46 + 87.85 = $966.31.

Now, we need to calculate her salary after eight years of service. 

After six years, her salary will be 966.31 + (10% of 966.31) = 966.31 + 96.63 = $1062.94.

After seven years, her salary will be 1062.94 + (10% of 1062.94) = 1062.94 + 106.29 = $1169.23.

After eight years, her salary will be 1169.23 + (10% of 1169.23) = 1169.23 + 116.92 = $1286.15.

The final answer is: $1286.15"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as 'H' and the number of copies Marilyn sold as 'M'. We know that M = 10H, since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's.

We also know that the total number of copies sold is 88,000, so we can write the equation: M + H = 88,000.

Substituting M = 10H into the equation, we get 10H + H = 88,000, which simplifies to 11H = 88,000.

To find the value of H, we divide both sides of the equation by 11: H = 88,000 / 11.

H = 8000.

The final answer is: 8000"
"To find out how many gift bags Christina needs, we first need to calculate the number of guests she expects to attend. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, we can find the number of expected attendees by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of invited guests.

16 (invited guests) - (1/4 * 16) = 16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply the number of expected attendees by 0.75.

12 (expected attendees) * 0.75 = 9

So, Christina needs 9 gift bags. Each gift bag costs $2, so we multiply the number of gift bags by the cost per bag.

9 (gift bags) * $2 = $18

Therefore, Christina will spend $18 on gift bags.

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount an adult and a child will eat and then multiply it by the number of adults and children, respectively.

An adult will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much as an adult, which is 10 / 2 = 5 lbs.

There are 20 adults, so the total amount of potato salad needed for adults is 20 * 10 = 200 lbs.

There are 5 children, so the total amount of potato salad needed for children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amount for adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

225"

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can set up an equation:

Time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles = Time it takes Lee to run the 400-meter hurdles + 2 seconds

We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. So, the time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change is:

Time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles = 38 + 2 = 40 seconds

Now, we know that Gerald's diet improved his speed by 10%. To find out how much time he saves with his improved diet, we need to calculate 10% of 40 seconds:

10% of 40 seconds = 0.1 * 40 = 4 seconds

So, Gerald saves 4 seconds with his improved diet. To find out how long it takes him to run the 400-meter hurdles with his improved diet, we subtract the time he saves from his original time:

Time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles with his improved diet = 40 - 4 = 36 seconds

"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls and then subtract the number of girls in the girl scout.

First, let's find the number of boys and girls. We know that 2/5 of the students are boys. 

Number of boys = (2/5) * 200 = 80

Since there are 200 students in total, the number of girls can be found by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students.

Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

Now, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = (2/3) * 120 = 80

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Number of girls not in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes Freda used to make 32 ounces of sauce. Since the sauce is made from the tomatoes in the cans, and each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes, we can set up a proportion to find the number of cans used.

Let's say the number of cans used is x. Since the sauce is half the volume of the tomatoes, the total volume of the tomatoes used is 2 times the volume of the sauce, which is 2 * 32 = 64 ounces.

Since each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes, the number of cans used is the total volume of tomatoes divided by the volume of tomatoes per can, which is 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Now that we know the number of cans used, we can find the total number of tomatoes used. Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes used is 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 2 episodes of a 1-hour show, which is a total of 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's call the number of episodes 'x'. Since each episode is 30 minutes, the total time he watched on Wednesday is 30x minutes.

On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is a total of 1.5 hours.

On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is a total of 2 hours.

The total time Frankie watched TV is 7 hours. We can set up an equation to represent this:

2 (Monday and Tuesday) + 30x (Wednesday) + 1.5 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 7

Combine like terms:

2 + 30x + 1.5 + 2 = 7

Combine the constants:

5.5 + 30x = 7

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

30x = 1.5

Divide both sides by 30:

x = 0.05

Since x represents the number of episodes, and each episode is 30 minutes, we can multiply x by 30 to find the total time in minutes:

0.05 * 30 = 1.5 minutes

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as 'x'. Since Henry wants to make twice as many as he did last year, he plans to bake 2x cookies this year.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has a total of 110 cookies. This can be represented as (2x + 15) - 5 = 110.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 10 = 110.

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get 2x = 100.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 50.

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of gas without the rewards, and then subtract the cashback amount.

The cost of gas per gallon is $3.00, and the person is buying 10 gallons. 

Total cost of gas = cost per gallon * number of gallons
Total cost of gas = $3.00 * 10
Total cost of gas = $30.00

The cashback reward is $0.20 per gallon, and the person is buying 10 gallons.

Total cashback = cashback per gallon * number of gallons
Total cashback = $0.20 * 10
Total cashback = $2.00

Now, we subtract the total cashback from the total cost of gas to find the final cost.

Final cost = Total cost of gas - Total cashback
Final cost = $30.00 - $2.00
Final cost = $28.00

The final answer is: $28.00"
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by each person, we need to multiply the width by the length of each roll-up. 

Beatrice's roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 rolls long, so the total number of roll-ups she ate is 2 * 24 = 48.

Marcell's roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 rolls long, so the total number of roll-ups he ate is 3 * 14 = 42.

To find the average number of roll-ups eaten by each person, we need to add the total number of roll-ups eaten by each person and divide by 2. 

Total roll-ups eaten = 48 + 42 = 90
Average roll-ups eaten = 90 / 2 = 45

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rows in 64 seconds, and then multiply that by the amount of water taken on per set.

First, let's find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rows in 16 seconds. Since it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find the time it takes her to row 10 feet by dividing 16 by 2, which is 8 seconds. 

Now, we can find out how many sets of 10 feet she rows in 64 seconds by dividing 64 by 8, which is 8 sets.

Since it takes 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, and Julia rows 8 sets of 10 feet, she takes on 8 * 2 = 16 liters of water.

2. Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.
3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

From point 1, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, then Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

From point 2, we know that Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Since Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs, the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo is 300 / 50 = 6.

"To calculate Sasha's profit, we need to first find the total cost of the lumber and the total selling price. 

The total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 = $100. 
The total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80. 
The total cost of all the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each. 
The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

The total selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $15 = $150. 
The total selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $24 = $120. 
The total selling price of all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total selling price minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

"To solve this problem, we need to use the given ratio of sugar to water, which is 7:13. This means that for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, there are 13 cups of water. 

First, we need to find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 7 + 13 = 20. 

Since the total amount of sugar and water used is 120, we can set up a proportion to find the number of teaspoons of sugar used. Let's say the number of teaspoons of sugar used is 7x. Then, the number of cups of water used is 13x.

We know that 7x + 13x = 120, since the total amount of sugar and water used is 120. Combining like terms, we get 20x = 120.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 20: x = 120 / 20 = 6.

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar used by multiplying 7 and x: 7 * 6 = 42.

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we first need to determine the total number of vehicles that were already at the port. We know that there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles initially is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30. To find the number of vehicles brought in on the second day, we subtract the initial number of vehicles from the total number of vehicles: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers brought in on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles brought in by the number of vehicles per container: 20 / 5 = 4.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship.

Let L be Lylah's salary four years ago. Then, Adrien's salary four years ago was 1.3L (since it's 30% higher).

We are given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000. So, we can set up the equation:

1.3L = 40000

To solve for L, we can divide both sides by 1.3:

L = 40000 / 1.3
L = 30769.23

Now that we know Lylah's salary four years ago, we can find her salary four years later. Since her salary increased simultaneously with Adrien's, we can assume the same percentage increase for both. However, we are not given the exact percentage increase, but we are given that Adrien's salary increased by 40% four years later. This means his new salary is 140% of his old salary (100% + 40% increase).

Adrien's new salary = 1.4 * 40000
Adrien's new salary = 56000

Since Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage, we can find her new salary by multiplying her old salary by 1.4:

Lylah's new salary = 1.4 * 30769.23
Lylah's new salary = 43055.522

Now, we can find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later by adding their new salaries:

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = 56000 + 43055.522
Total salary = 99055.522

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So, the total number of sheets he uses in a week is 2 pads * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the number of sheets Miguel uses in a week by 4 to find the total number of sheets he uses in a month: 60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month.

Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, so Kael brought 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits each person brought:
Morisette: 5 (apples) + 8 (oranges) = 13 fruits
Kael: 10 (apples) + 4 (oranges) = 14 fruits

The total number of fruits they have is 13 (Morisette's fruits) + 14 (Kael's fruits) = 27.

"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate her sleep hours for each day and add them up.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

The rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday) she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours for each part of the week:

- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday and Wednesday: 2 days * 6 hours = 12 hours
- Thursday to Sunday: 5 days * 7 hours = 35 hours

Adding up the total hours: 8 + 12 + 35 = 55 hours

"To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour.

First, let's calculate the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's calculate the remaining time after 3 hours. 
Total time = 7 hours
Time already run = 3 hours
Remaining time = Total time - Time already run
Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours
Remaining time = 4 hours

Now, let's calculate the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour * 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distances together to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours.

Total distance = Distance at 10 mph + Distance at 5 mph
Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total distance = 50 miles

Julia initially bought a package of spoons, but we don't know the quantity yet. Her husband bought a package of 5 new spoons. Julia used 3 spoons while making the stew. Later, she had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's denote the number of spoons Julia initially bought as 'x'. The total number of spoons after her husband bought 5 more is x + 5. After Julia used 3 spoons, the total number of spoons is (x + 5) - 3 = x + 2.

We are given that the total number of spoons after Julia used 3 is 12. So, we can set up the equation x + 2 = 12.

To find the value of 'x', we need to solve the equation x + 2 = 12. Subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation gives us x = 10.

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of a watermelon. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs $15, a watermelon costs 3 * $15 = $45.

Next, we find the cost of an orange. An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so an orange costs $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each item:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is the sum of these costs: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours per patient.

The total time spent by doctors is 500 patients * 0.4 hours/patient = 200 hours.

The hospital charges $150 an hour to the doctors, so the total cost to the hospital is 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

The hospital charges $200 an hour to patients, and each patient is seen for 0.4 hours. The total amount charged to patients is 500 patients * $200/hour * 0.4 hours/patient = $40,000.

The hospital's profit is the total amount charged to patients minus the total cost to the hospital, which is $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

The final numerical answer is: $10,000"
"To find the number of elves left, we first need to determine the number of elves that quit after the children vomit on them. Since a third of the elves quit, we can calculate this as follows:

60 (initial elves) * 1/3 = 20 elves quit after being vomited on

Now, we subtract the elves that quit from the initial number to find the remaining elves:

60 - 20 = 40 elves remaining

Then, 10 more elves quit after being kicked by the kids. We subtract these from the remaining elves:

40 - 10 = 30 elves left

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total expenditure for the two months, we need to add the expenditure in May and June. 

The expenditure in May was $500. 
The expenditure in June was $60 less than May, so it is $500 - $60 = $440.

Now, let's add the expenditures for the two months: $500 + $440 = $940.

The final answer is: $940"
"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the total number of rides taken by Pam and Fred and then multiply it by the cost of each ride.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she took a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he took a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

The total number of rides taken by both Pam and Fred is 4 + 6 = 10 rides.

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is 10 * 6 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first determine how many miles he walked on Tuesday. 

Since Walt walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday, and he walked 4 miles on Monday, we can calculate the miles walked on Tuesday by multiplying the miles walked on Monday by 6. 

Miles walked on Tuesday = 4 * 6 = 24 miles.

Now, we know that the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. We already know the miles walked on Monday (4 miles) and Tuesday (24 miles). To find the miles walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage.

Miles walked on Wednesday = Total mileage - (Miles walked on Monday + Miles walked on Tuesday)
= 41 - (4 + 24)
= 41 - 28
= 13 miles.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how much Tom pays in a year, we need to calculate the total cost of car washes per month and then multiply it by 12.

Tom gets 4 car washes a month, and each car wash costs $15. 

The total cost per month is 4 car washes * $15/car wash = $60/month.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total cost per year is $60/month * 12 months = $720/year.

The final numerical answer is: $720"
"To find out how many video games Bobby has, we first need to determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5. 

Brian initially had 20 video games but lost 5, so he has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. To find out how many video games Bobby has, we multiply the number of video games Brian has by 3 and then subtract 5.

3 times the number of video games Brian has is 3 * 15 = 45.

Bobby has 5 fewer than 45, so Bobby has 45 - 5 = 40 video games.

"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we first need to find the total number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands = 27 * (1/3)
= 27 * 1/3
= 9

Now, we know that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. So, we can calculate the number of female Scottish unicorns as follows:

Number of female Scottish unicorns = 9 * (2/3)
= 9 * 2/3
= 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we need to calculate the cost of the items, the delivery fee, and the tip, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the items:
- 2 subs for $7.50 each: 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
- 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each: 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
- 2 cookies for $1.00 each: 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
Total cost of items: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, let's calculate the delivery fee: 20% of $20.00 is 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00

Now, let's add the delivery fee to the total cost of the items: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, let's add the $5.00 tip to the total: $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

The final answer is: $29.00"
"To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the total number of questions he was able to complete in each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions in each test.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 

First, let's find out how many questions Mark could have completed in 8 hours: 
8 hours * 5 questions per hour = 40 questions

Since Mark had 75 questions in the first test, he left 75 - 40 = 35 questions incomplete.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at the same rate of 5 questions per hour.

Now, let's find out how many questions Mark could have completed in 6 hours: 
6 hours * 5 questions per hour = 30 questions

Since Mark had 100 questions in the second test, he left 100 - 30 = 70 questions incomplete.

To find the total number of questions Mark left incomplete, we add the incomplete questions from both tests: 
35 (from the first test) + 70 (from the second test) = 105 questions

The final answer is: 105"

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine the total number of semi-automatic cars. We know that there are 20 cars in total, with 12 being automatic and 4 being manual. 

Total number of cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4

To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars:
Semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars by dividing the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiplying by 100:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

"Let's break down the information given. We know there are 700 bees in total. We also know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many babies as queens. 

Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W. We can express the relationships between these variables as:

W = 2B
B = 2Q

Since there are 700 bees in total, we can write the equation:

W + B + Q = 700

Substituting the expressions for W and B in terms of Q, we get:

2B + B + Q = 700
3B + Q = 700

Since B = 2Q, we can substitute this into the equation:

3(2Q) + Q = 700
6Q + Q = 700
7Q = 700

Dividing both sides by 7, we get:

Q = 100

Now that we know Q, we can find B:

B = 2Q
B = 2(100)
B = 200

Finally, we can find W:

W = 2B
W = 2(200)
W = 400

"To find out how much money Jordan would earn in one week, we need to calculate the total hours he would work in a week and then multiply it by his hourly wage.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day, if he spent that time working instead, he would work 2 hours a day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total hours he would work in a week is 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours.

Now, we multiply the total hours worked in a week by his hourly wage: 14 hours * $10/hour = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of food items and non-food items separately and then add them together.

The food items are milk and eggs, which cost 2 dollars and 3 dollars respectively. So, the total cost of food items is 2 + 3 = 5 dollars.

The non-food items are light bulbs, cups, and roach traps, which cost 3 dollars, 3 dollars, and 4 dollars respectively. However, there is a 10% tax on these items. To find the total cost of non-food items, we need to calculate the tax first.

The total cost of non-food items before tax is 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars. The tax is 10% of 10 dollars, which is 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar. So, the total cost of non-food items after tax is 10 + 1 = 11 dollars.

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of food items and non-food items: 5 + 11 = 16 dollars.

The final answer is: 16"
"To calculate the total profit, we first need to determine the total income and total expenses. 

Kim has 3 current clients and 5 potential clients, making a total of 8 clients. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. 

Total bottles of bleach needed per week: 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed per week: 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

The cost of bleach per week: 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
The cost of cloths per week: 8 packs * $5/pack = $40

Total expenses per week: $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72

Kim's total income per week is given as $92. 

To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income: 
Profit = Total income - Total expenses
Profit = $92 - $72
Profit = $20

"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we first need to calculate the total number of pineapples in his field. 

Since John has 10 hectares of a pineapple field and there are 100 pineapples per hectare, we can multiply the number of hectares by the number of pineapples per hectare to get the total number of pineapples.

10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we need to find out how many 3-month periods are in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so we can divide 12 by 3 to get the number of 3-month periods.

12 months / 3 months/period = 4 periods

Now, we can multiply the total number of pineapples by the number of 3-month periods to find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year.

1000 pineapples * 4 periods = 4000 pineapples

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left return, which is 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees.
   So, the total number of bees that have left and returned is 30 (initially left) + 15 (returned) = 45 bees.
3. In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as initially left (30) fly from the hive and leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
   So, the total number of bees that have left is now 45 (initially left and returned) + 60 (newly left) = 105 bees.
4. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. This means 45 bees return to the hive.

Total cost = cost of child ticket + cost of adult ticket
Total cost = $10 + $12
Total cost = $22

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, we need to add this to the total cost to find out how much she gave the cashier.

Total given = Total cost + Change
Total given = $22 + $8

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. 

Let's represent the number of friends Dorothy has as 'x'. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can represent Charlie's friends as 3x. We are given that Charlie has 12 friends, so we can set up the equation 3x = 12.

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3. This gives us x = 12 / 3, which simplifies to x = 4. 

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find the number of friends James has. We are told that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, so we can represent James' friends as 4x. Since we know x = 4, we can substitute this value into the expression 4x to get 4 * 4 = 16.

"To determine the time it takes for each person to get home, we need to calculate the distance in feet and then divide it by their respective speeds.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for each person to get home:

Steve's time: 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will be the winner. To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to subtract the winner's time from the loser's time.

Waiting time = Tim's time - Steve's time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Dave ate 14 french fries initially.
2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   Now, the total amount eaten by Dave and the seagull is 14 + 7 = 21 french fries.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 french fries.
   Now, the total amount eaten is 21 + 9 = 30 french fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries. Let's denote the initial number of fries as x. 
   After the seagull and pigeons ate, the remaining fries are x - 30.
   The raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is (2/3) * (x - 30).
   The remaining fries after the raccoon is (x - 30) - (2/3) * (x - 30).
   Simplifying this, we get (1/3) * (x - 30).
5. After the raccoon, ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 behind. 
   So, the remaining fries after the raccoon is (1/3) * (x - 30) - 1 = 5.
   Now, we can solve for x: (1/3) * (x - 30) = 6.
   Multiplying both sides by 3, we get x - 30 = 18.
   Adding 30 to both sides, we get x = 48.

"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the length of each type of baked good in feet and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of each type of baked good to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

- Each roll is 4 inches long, which is 4/12 = 1/3 feet long.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long, which is 6/12 = 1/2 feet long.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 1/3 feet per roll = 300 * 1/3 = 100 feet
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 1/2 feet per croissant = 120 * 1/2 = 60 feet
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet per baguette = 60 * 2 = 120 feet

Now, let's add the lengths together to find the total length of the baked goods:

100 feet (rolls) + 60 feet (croissants) + 120 feet (baguettes) = 280 feet

The total length of the baked goods is 280 feet.

The monkeys need 200 bananas per month, the gorillas need 400 bananas per month, and the baboons need 100 bananas per month. 

Total monthly consumption = 200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas per month.

Since the zookeeper needs to order bananas for 2 months, we multiply the total monthly consumption by 2.

Total bananas needed for 2 months = 700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas.

The final answer is: 1400"
"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he's running back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. 

To find the total distance Kelly ran, we add the initial 200 yards to the distance she ran to the 40-yard line and back: 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Now, we compare the distances: Blake ran 3000 yards, and Kelly ran 2920 yards. Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 

Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Now, let's find the number of fish caught by Locsin. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Now, let's find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin. 

Total fish caught = Total fish caught by Anakin + Total fish caught by Locsin
Total fish caught = 19 + 13
Total fish caught = 32

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price increase every two months and add it to the original price. 

The original price of the bag of marbles is $20. 

After 2 months, the price increases by 20% of $20, which is 0.20 * $20 = $4. 
The new price after 2 months is $20 + $4 = $24.

After 4 months, the price increases by 20% of $24, which is 0.20 * $24 = $4.80.
The new price after 4 months is $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.

After 6 months, the price increases by 20% of $28.80, which is 0.20 * $28.80 = $5.76.
The new price after 6 months is $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56.

After 8 months, the price increases by 20% of $34.56, which is 0.20 * $34.56 = $6.912.
The new price after 8 months is $34.56 + $6.912 = $41.472.

After 10 months, the price increases by 20% of $41.472, which is 0.20 * $41.472 = $8.2944.
The new price after 10 months is $41.472 + $8.2944 = $49.7664.

After 12 months, the price increases by 20% of $49.7664, which is 0.20 * $49.7664 = $9.95328.
The new price after 12 months is $49.7664 + $9.95328 = $59.71968.

After 14 months, the price increases by 20% of $59.71968, which is 0.20 * $59.71968 = $11.943936.
The new price after 14 months is $59.71968 + $11.943936 = $71.663616.

"To find the total worth of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then add them together.

The doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Since an action figure costs $5, the doll costs 3 * $5 = $15.

One red car costs $4. Since there are 5 red cars, the total cost of the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

There are 3 action figures, and each costs $5. So, the total cost of the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, let's add the cost of the doll, the red cars, and the action figures together: $15 (doll) + $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) = $50.

The total worth of all the toys is $50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference in income between hiring the accountant and doing the taxes herself.

If Jackie does the taxes herself, she'll lose $35/hour in missed income for 3 hours of freelance work. So, the total income lost is $35/hour * 3 hours = $105.

The cost of hiring the accountant is $90.

Now, let's calculate the difference in income: 
Income from doing taxes herself - Income from hiring the accountant = $105 - $90 = $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer accessories and subtract that from her budget.

The total cost of the computer accessories is:
- Computer: â‚¬1090
- Scanner: â‚¬157
- CD burner: â‚¬74
- Printer: â‚¬102

Total cost = â‚¬1090 + â‚¬157 + â‚¬74 + â‚¬102 = â‚¬1323

Now, we subtract the total cost from Elvira's budget:
â‚¬1500 (budget) - â‚¬1323 (total cost) = â‚¬177

So, Elvira will have â‚¬177 left for her clothing.

The final answer is: â‚¬177"
"To determine how many times Sandra has to babysit, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she needs for the Spanish flans and divide that by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs needed for 15 Spanish flans. Since each flan requires 3 eggs, we multiply 15 by 3:

15 * 3 = 45 eggs

Now, we know Sandra gets 9 eggs per babysitting job. To find out how many times she needs to babysit, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job:

45 eggs / 9 eggs per babysitting job = 5 babysitting jobs

So, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to get enough eggs for 15 Spanish flans.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write an equation:

S = 2B

In 2 years, their ages will be B + 2 and S + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write another equation:

(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28

Substituting S = 2B into the second equation, we get:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to first determine what ""twice the money Ethel has"" is. Since Ethel has $8, twice that amount would be 2 * 8 = 16.

Now, we know Jimmy has $2 more than that, so we add 2 to 16. 16 + 2 = 18.

Jimmy has $18.

"To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he walks in a week. 

There are 7 days in a week. Pancho walks 20 miles a day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, he walks 20 * 5 = 100 miles from Monday to Friday. 

On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. So, he walks 10 * 2 = 20 miles on the weekends.

Now, let's add the miles he walks from Monday to Friday and the miles he walks on the weekends. 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants separately and then add them together.

The hat costs $25.

The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 * $25 = $75.

The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. The average cost is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

Next, let's calculate the total number of legs for the insects: 90 insects * 6 legs/insect = 540 legs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs for the mutant invertebrates: 3 invertebrates * 10 legs/invertebrate = 30 legs.

Finally, let's add the total number of legs for each group together: 640 legs + 540 legs + 30 legs = 1210 legs.

The final answer is: 1210"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, and Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old. So, Sally Four is also 8 years old.
2. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four. Since Sally Four is 8 years old, Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.
3. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. So, Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of three birds: Sally Four (8), Granny Red (16), and Sally Two (19). The only bird left is the one at the Caboose, which is Sally Two's counterpart, Sally One. However, the problem doesn't mention Sally One's age. Since Sally Two is 19, and Sally Four is 8, and Sally Thirtytwo is 8, it seems like the ages are based on a pattern of 8 years apart. Therefore, Sally One would be 8 years younger than Sally Two, making Sally One 19 - 8 = 11 years old.

The total age of the four birds is 8 (Sally Four) + 11 (Sally One) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) = 54.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we first need to calculate the increased minimum payments for each debt. 

The minimum payment for the student loans is $300, so 50% more than that would be $300 + ($300 * 0.5) = $300 + $150 = $450.

The minimum payment for the credit card is $200, so 50% more than that would be $200 + ($200 * 0.5) = $200 + $100 = $300.

The minimum payment for the mortgage is $500, so 50% more than that would be $500 + ($500 * 0.5) = $500 + $250 = $750.

Now, we need to add up the increased minimum payments for each debt to find the total monthly payment. 

$450 (student loans) + $300 (credit card) + $750 (mortgage) = $1500.

To find the total amount paid in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12.

$1500 * 12 = $18,000.

"To find the total time it takes Billy to peel and cut all the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes, then add the time it takes to cut one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds = 5/60 minutes (converting seconds to minutes)

Now, let's calculate the total time to peel all the potatoes:
60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes/potato = 90 minutes

Next, let's calculate the total time to cut all the potatoes:
60 potatoes * (5/60) minutes/potato = 5 minutes

Now, we add the total time to peel and cut all the potatoes:
90 minutes (peeling) + 5 minutes (cutting) = 95 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much they made in total from selling lemonade and then subtract the cost of sugar to find the cost of lemons.

Let's start by finding the total revenue from selling lemonade. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Since they made $25 in profit, and we know that profit is revenue minus cost, we can set up an equation to find the total revenue. Let's denote the number of gallons as 'g'. The total revenue is $10g. The cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5. The total cost is $5g. The profit is $25, so we can write the equation as:

$10g - $5g = $25

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$5g = $25

Dividing both sides by $5, we get:

g = 5

Now that we know they made 5 gallons, we can find the total revenue:

Total revenue = $10g = $10 * 5 = $50

The cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $5, so the total cost is $5g = $5 * 5 = $25. Since they made $25 in profit, the cost of sugar is $50 - $25 = $25. 

The cost of lemons is the total cost minus the cost of sugar, which is $25 - $25 = $0. However, this is not possible since they must have spent some money on lemons. This means that the initial assumption that the profit is $25 is incorrect. 

However, we can still find the cost of lemons. Let's denote the cost of lemons as 'L' and the cost of sugar as 'S'. We know that the total cost is $5g, so L + S = $5g. We also know that the profit is $25, so the total revenue is $25 + $5g. The revenue per gallon is $10, so the total revenue is $10g. We can set up the equation as:

$10g = $25 + $5g

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$5g = $25

Dividing both sides by $5, we get:

g = 5

We already know that g = 5. Now we can find the cost of lemons and sugar. The total cost is $5g = $5 * 5 = $25. The cost of sugar is $25 - $25 = $0, which is not possible. However, we can still"
"To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we first need to determine the total number of Chinese participants. 

The total number of participants is 240, and the number of Japanese participants is 80. 

So, the number of Chinese participants is 240 - 80 = 160.

We are given that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. 

To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants: 160 - 60 = 100.

The number of girls on the Chinese team is 100.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations and calculate the remaining amount after each expense.

1. Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent: 
   1/4 of 6000 = 6000 * 1/4 = 1500

   Remaining amount after rent = 6000 - 1500 = 4500

2. Zaid spends 1/3 on car fuel:
   1/3 of 4500 = 4500 * 1/3 = 1500

   Remaining amount after car fuel = 4500 - 1500 = 3000

3. Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity:
   Half of 3000 = 3000 * 1/2 = 1500

   Remaining amount after donation = 3000 - 1500 = 1500

4. Zaid gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$:
   Total given to family = 200 + 700 = 900

   Remaining amount after giving to family = 1500 - 900 = 600

Therefore, Zaid will still have 600 dollars after all these expenses and donations.

The final answer is: $600"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Bo has 40 crabs.
- Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.
- Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

To find the total number of crabs the three have together, we add the number of crabs each one has: 40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122.

The final answer is: 122"
"To find out how much Lloyd earned in the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd tutored 5 hours at $10 per hour, so his earnings for the first week are:
5 hours * $10/hour = $50

For the second week, Lloyd tutored 8 hours at $10 per hour, so his earnings for the second week are:
8 hours * $10/hour = $80

Now, let's add his earnings for both weeks:
$50 (first week) + $80 (second week) = $130

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the number of votes the loser got, we first need to find the total number of votes the winner got. Since the winner got 3/4 of the votes, we can calculate this by multiplying 3/4 by the total number of students who voted, which is 80.

3/4 * 80 = 60

This means the winner got 60 votes. To find the number of votes the loser got, we subtract the number of votes the winner got from the total number of students who voted.

80 - 60 = 20

The loser got 20 votes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses is 4x.

We are also given that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations. So, the number of pink calla lilies is 5x.

We know that the total number of flowers ordered is the sum of red roses, white carnations, and pink calla lilies. However, we are not given the total number of flowers. But we do know that the missing red roses are the only ones that need to be delivered by 5 pm.

Since we don't have the total number of flowers, we can't directly calculate the number of red roses. However, we can express the number of red roses in terms of 'x'. 

The number of red roses is 4x.

To find the value of 'x', we need more information about the total number of flowers. But since we are not given that information, we can express the number of red roses in terms of 'x'. 

However, we can express the number of red roses in terms of the number of pink calla lilies. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is 5x. Since the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, the number of white carnations is 1/5 of the number of pink calla lilies. 

So, the number of white carnations is 1/5 * 5x = x.

Since the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations, the number of red roses is 4 * x = 4x.

We are given that the number of pink calla lilies is 200. Since the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, the number of white carnations is 200 / 5 = 40.

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. The number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations, so the number of red roses is 4 * 40 = 160.

The final answer is: 160"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

Let's denote Mark's current age as M and Jean's current age as J. We know that J = M + 2.

Two years ago, Mark was M - 2 years old, and Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old. We are also given that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. This can be written as:

M - 2 = (1/2) * 28 + 5

Simplifying the equation:

M - 2 = 14 + 5
M - 2 = 19
M = 21

Now that we know Mark's age, we can find Jean's age by adding 2 to Mark's age:

J = M + 2
J = 21 + 2
J = 23

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time for each team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them up.

The well-rounded team has each member running 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are 4 members, the total time for the well-rounded team is 4 * 55 = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run 400 meters in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 400 meters in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 400 meters in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. The total time for the less well-rounded team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

To find the difference in time between the two teams, we subtract the time of the less well-rounded team from the time of the well-rounded team: 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, and then find the difference between these two probabilities.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is the probability of rolling a 4, 5, or 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5, since there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25 or 25%.

To find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 50% - 25% = 25%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To find out how many apples Jenna picked, we need to determine half of the number of apples her mom picked. Since her mom picked 20 apples, we can calculate Jenna's share by dividing 20 by 2.

20 / 2 = 10

Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom picked 20, Jenna picked 10 apples. To find the total number of apples they both picked, we need to add Jenna's share to her mom's share.

20 (mom's apples) + 10 (Jenna's apples) = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of small rodents (rats and hamsters) and the total number of straw pieces distributed among them. 

Let's start by finding the total number of straw pieces distributed among the small rodents. We know that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, and 20 pieces are distributed among the rabbits. So, the total number of straw pieces distributed among the small rodents and rabbits is 160 + 20 = 180.

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, let's assume the number of rats in each cage is 'r'. The total number of rats is 3r. Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw pieces distributed among the rats is 6 * 3r = 18r.

The hamsters are kept in 10 cages, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of straw pieces distributed among the hamsters is 5 * 10 = 50.

We know that the total number of straw pieces distributed among the small rodents and rabbits is 180. We also know that the total number of straw pieces distributed among the rats and hamsters is 18r + 50. Since the total number of straw pieces distributed among the small rodents is 160, we can set up the equation:

18r + 50 = 160

Subtracting 50 from both sides of the equation gives us:

18r = 110

Dividing both sides of the equation by 18 gives us:

r = 110 / 18
r = 6.11 (round down to the nearest whole number is not possible here as we are looking for the number of rats in each cage, so we will round down to 6.11 is not a whole number, but we can't have a fraction of a rat, so we need to re-evaluate the equation)

However, since we know that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, and the hamsters have 50 pieces, the remaining straw must be distributed among the rats. So, the total number of straw pieces distributed among the rats is 160 - 50 = 110.

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, the total number of rats is 110 / 6 = 18.33 (round down to the nearest whole number is not possible here as we are looking for the number of rats in each cage, so we will round down to 18.33 is not a whole number, but we can't have a fraction of a rat, so we need to re-evaluate the equation)

"To calculate the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months and add it to the initial amount.

The monthly interest rate is 2%, which as a decimal is 0.02. 

The interest for the first month is $100 * 0.02 = $2.
The interest for the second month is $102 * 0.02 = $2.04.
The interest for the third month is $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808.

Now, let's add the interest for all three months to the initial amount:
$100 + $2 + $2.04 + $2.0808 = $106.1208.

Rounding to two decimal places, the total amount Mandy should pay is $106.12.

The final answer is: $106.12"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total cost incurred by the trader, which includes the cost of buying the bags and the cost of transportation. 

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. The cost of buying 'x' bags at $20 per bag is 20x. The cost of transporting 'x' bags at $2 per bag is 2x. 

The total cost is the sum of these two costs: total_cost = 20x + 2x = 22x.

The trader sold the bags at $30 each, so the total revenue is 30x.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost: profit = total_revenue - total_cost = 30x - 22x = 8x.

We are given that the profit is $400, so we can set up the equation: 8x = 400.

To find the number of bags, we need to solve for x: x = 400 / 8 = 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide it by 3.

First, let's find the cost of the food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. Since they spent $20.25 on tickets, the cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

The cost of the rides is 2 rides * $33 per ride = $66.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

Since they split the cost evenly, we divide the total cost by 3: $102 / 3 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"To find out how many peaches John collects, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he collects peaches and then multiply it by the number of peaches he collects per minute.

Since John collects peaches for 3 hours, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, we know John collects 2 peaches per minute. To find the total number of peaches, we multiply the total minutes by the peaches collected per minute:

180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

So, John collects 360 peaches.

"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ducks needs per day, we first need to calculate the total pounds of insects they need per week. Since there are ten ducks and each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, we multiply the number of ducks by the pounds of insects each duck needs per week.

10 ducks * 3.5 pounds/duck/week = 35 pounds/week

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of insects they need per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total pounds of insects needed per week by 7.

35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

So, the flock of ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day to survive.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in the number of trees Tom has each year. 

Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year, so the net change is 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year.

Since Tom starts with 50 trees, we need to calculate the total number of trees after 10 years. 

In 10 years, the net change is 8 * 10 = 80 trees. So, the total number of trees after 10 years is 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

However, after 10 years, 30% of the trees die. To find the number of trees that die, we multiply 130 by 0.3: 130 * 0.3 = 39 trees.

Now, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees: 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

The final answer is: 91"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink plastic flamingos on Sue's front yard.

On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out on Sue's front yard. So, now there are 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. Now, there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos.

The total number of flamingos on Sue's front yard is 30 pink + 6 white = 36 flamingos.

To find out how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how much change Violetta will get, we need to first determine how many crayons she can buy with $20. Since one crayon costs $2, we can divide the total amount she has by the cost of one crayon.

$20 Ã· $2 = 10 crayons

Since Violetta needs 5 different colors, we can assume she will buy 2 crayons of each color. 

The total number of crayons she will buy is 5 * 2 = 10 crayons.

Since she can buy 10 crayons with $20, and she only needs 10 crayons, she will spend the entire $20.

The change she will get is $0.

The final answer is: $0"
"To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser, since a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. 

Cost of a pencil: $1.20
Cost of an eraser: $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens. 

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total pounds of carrots that will be distributed to the restaurants. 

Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. 

Total pounds of carrots distributed = Number of restaurants * Pounds per restaurant
Total pounds of carrots distributed = 40 * 2
Total pounds of carrots distributed = 80 pounds

Now, we need to subtract the total pounds of carrots distributed from the total pounds of carrots available to find out how many pounds will not be used.

Pounds of carrots not used = Total pounds of carrots available - Total pounds of carrots distributed
Pounds of carrots not used = 200 - 80
Pounds of carrots not used = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the number of children in Soda, we need to subtract the total number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

First, let's add the number of men and women:
8417 + 9092 = 17509

Now, subtract the sum from the total population to find the number of children:
23786 - 17509 = 6277

So, there are 6277 children in Soda.

The final answer is: 6277"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Elaine had 20 PokÃ©mon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times the number of cards she initially had: 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month: 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months: (60 + 40) * 2 = 200 cards.

To find the total number of cards Elaine has now, we need to add the cards she had initially to the cards she collected in each month: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320.

The final answer is: 320"
"Let's break down the information given. Mark edits 1000 sentences each week, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, he also edits 1000 sentences for Publisher B.

We know that Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 2 * 5 cents = 10 cents per sentence.

Mark's total earnings from Publisher A would be 1000 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 5000 cents.

Since Mark earns twice as much from Publisher B, his total earnings from Publisher B would be 2 * 5000 cents = 10000 cents.

Mark's total weekly earnings would be the sum of his earnings from both publishers: 5000 cents + 10000 cents = 15000 cents.

The final answer is: 15000"
"To find the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the total number of pails he gets in a day and then multiply it by the amount of water in each pail.

Baldur gets 5 pails of water every morning and 6 pails of water every afternoon. So, the total number of pails he gets in a day is 5 + 6 = 11 pails.

Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, the total amount of water he gets every day is 11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters.

The final answer is: 55"
"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider both the one-time monetary reward and the 5% raise in salary.

First, let's calculate the total amount John earns from his weekly salary for the year. Since he makes $2000 per week and works every week of the year (52 weeks), his total earnings from his salary would be:

2000 * 52 = 104,000

Now, let's calculate the 5% raise in salary. A 5% raise on $2000 would be:

2000 * 0.05 = 100

So, his new weekly salary would be:

2000 + 100 = 2100

Now, let's calculate his total earnings from his new salary for the year:

2100 * 52 = 109,200

Adding the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to his total earnings from his salary, we get:

109,200 + 5000 = 114,200

Therefore, John's total earnings for the year would be $114,200.

The final answer is: $114,200"
"To find the total number of barrels of wine produced per year, we need to calculate the total number of tons of grapes produced per year and then multiply it by the number of barrels of wine each ton can make.

First, let's find the total number of tons of grapes produced per year. Since each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year and there are 10 acres, we multiply 5 tons/acre by 10 acres:

5 tons/acre * 10 acres = 50 tons

Next, we know that each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine. To find the total number of barrels of wine produced per year, we multiply the total number of tons of grapes by the number of barrels each ton can make:

50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

So, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for the sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish separately and then add them together.

For the sandwiches, Carl ate 7 days' worth of sandwiches (since he ate one every day) and used 2 slices per sandwich. So, the total slices used for sandwiches = 7 * 2 = 14.

For the omelets, Carl ate 3 days' worth of omelets and used one more slice per omelet than per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. So, the total slices used for omelets = 3 * 3 = 9.

For the macaroni and cheese dish, Carl used 8 slices.

Now, let's add the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish together: 14 + 9 + 8 = 31.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the number of pens she initially had and the number of pens she bought.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so she had a total of 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag, so she bought 6 x 9 = 54 blue pens.

She also bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag, so she bought 2 x 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, let's add the number of pens she bought to the number of pens she initially had: 32 (initial pens) + 54 (blue pens) + 12 (red pens) = 98 pens.

However, we don't know how many green pens she bought, so we can't add those to the total. But since the question doesn't mention green pens being bought, we can assume that the number of green pens remains the same.

So, the total number of pens Janet has now is 98.

The final answer is: 98"
"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to find the total score she needs for the semester. Since there are six tests and she wants an average of 93, we multiply 93 by 6 to get the total score.

Total score = Average * Number of tests
Total score = 93 * 6
Total score = 558

Next, we need to find the total score of the first five tests. We add up the scores of the first five tests.

Score of first five tests = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86
Score of first five tests = 338

Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester, we need to find the lowest score among the first five tests. The lowest score is 71.

Now, we subtract the lowest score from the total score of the first five tests to get the new total score.

New total score of first five tests = Score of first five tests - Lowest score
New total score of first five tests = 338 - 71
New total score of first five tests = 267

Now, we add the score of the sixth test to the new total score of the first five tests to get the total score for the semester.

Total score = New total score of first five tests + Score of sixth test
558 = 267 + Score of sixth test

To find the score of the sixth test, we subtract the new total score of the first five tests from the total score.

Score of sixth test = Total score - New total score of first five tests
Score of sixth test = 558 - 267
Score of sixth test = 291

"To find the total number of kilometers Michael rode his bike, we need to calculate the total kilometers for the two different periods.

First, let's calculate the total kilometers for the first four weeks when he rode 25 kilometers each time, 5 times a week. 

Total kilometers in the first four weeks = 25 km * 5 times/week * 4 weeks = 25 * 5 * 4 = 500 km

Next, let's calculate the total kilometers for the next three weeks when he rode 60 kilometers each time, 2 times a week.

Total kilometers in the next three weeks = 60 km * 2 times/week * 3 weeks = 60 * 2 * 3 = 360 km

Now, we add the total kilometers from both periods to find the overall total.

Total kilometers = 500 km + 360 km = 860 km

"To find the total weight of the bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the weight of the chocolate bars. Since there are 25 chocolate bars and each weighs 40g, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 * 40g = 1000g

Next, let's find the weight of the candied apples. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, the weight of each candied apple is:
40g / 2 = 20g

Now, let's find the total weight of the candied apples:
80 * 20g = 1600g

Finally, let's add the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, half a dozen plates will cost 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

We are also given that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since twenty dozen cups is equivalent to 240 cups, we can find the cost of each cup by dividing the total cost by the number of cups: $34,800 / 240 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy and the total amount of money she has earned so far. 

The total cost of the items is the cost of the jacket plus the cost of 2 pairs of shoes: 
$30 (jacket) + 2 * $20 (shoes) = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved before she started babysitting. She earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, so the total amount she has earned from babysitting is:
$5 * 4 (number of times she babysits) = $20.

The total amount of money Sara has is the sum of the money she already had and the money she earned from babysitting:
$10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting earnings) = $30.

To find out how much more money Sara needs, we subtract the total amount she has from the total cost of the items:
$70 (total cost) - $30 (total amount she has) = $40.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by the amount she earns per lawn mowing:
$40 (remaining amount) / $4 (lawn mowing earnings) = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. We know that W = R + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42. Since red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, we can set up the following equation:

3R + 5W = 42

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

R = 4

"To find the time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park since he walks around the edge. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the dimensions of the park, l = 6 miles and w = 1.5 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the perimeter by his speed:

Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, let's denote the number of customers on the first day as 'x'. We know that the number of customers on the second day is 50 more than the first day, so it can be represented as x + 50.

The total number of customers by the third day is given as 500. Since the number of customers on the second day is x + 50, the number of customers on the third day can be represented as (x + 50) + y, where y is the number of customers on the third day. However, we are given that the total number of customers by the third day is 500, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 50) + y = 500.

However, we are also given that the total number of customers by the third day was 500, and we know that Sloane counted 100 customers on the first day. So, the total number of customers by the second day is 100 + 50 = 150. This means that the number of customers on the third day is 500 - 150 = 350.

Therefore, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is 350.

The final answer is: 350"
"Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, the rate of water loss for both pools is 8 gallons/minute (4 gallons/minute each). 

In 4 minutes, the total water lost from both pools is 8 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 32 gallons.

The big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as 'y'. Then, the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y.

We can set up the equation based on the initial and current water levels:

Initial water in the big pool - Initial water in the small pool = Current water in the big pool - Current water in the small pool - Total water lost

2x - x = 4y - y - 32

Simplifying the equation:

x = 4y - 32

Since the initial amount of water in the big pool is twice as much as the small pool, we can also write:

2x = 2y

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = y

Substituting x = y into the equation x = 4y - 32:

y = 4y - 32

Subtracting 4y from both sides:

-3y = -32

Dividing both sides by -3:

y = 32/3

The current amount of water in the small pool is 32/3 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10.67}$"

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Janeth will pay in 12 months and then subtract that from the initial amount borrowed plus the additional 10% interest.

First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth will pay in 12 months:

$165/month * 12 months = $1980

Now, let's calculate the total amount Janeth borrowed with the additional 10% interest:

$2000 + (10% of $2000) = $2000 + $200 = $2200

Now, let's subtract the total amount Janeth will pay from the total amount she borrowed with interest:

"To find the average age of the three in three years, we first need to find their current ages and then add 3 to each age. 

Given that Harriet is 21 years old, and she is half the age of Zack, we can find Zack's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 2. 

Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age = 2 * 21 = 42

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so we can find Adrian's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 3.

Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age = 3 * 21 = 63

Now, we have the current ages of the three: Harriet (21), Zack (42), and Adrian (63). To find their ages in three years, we add 3 to each age.

Harriet's age in 3 years = 21 + 3 = 24
Zack's age in 3 years = 42 + 3 = 45
Adrian's age in 3 years = 63 + 3 = 66

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3.

Average age = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna. 

Naomi scored 68 points. 
Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. 
Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 
Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. 
Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

The total points scored by the four students is 251. 
We know that Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna scored 68, 44, and 85 points respectively. 
So, the total points scored by them is 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points scored by all four students. 
Jojo scored 251 - 197 = 54 points.

Water left in the tank = 120 - 90
Water left in the tank = 30 liters

Now, Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left. 
Rainwater collected = 2 * Water left in the tank
Rainwater collected = 2 * 30

Number of geraniums: 90
Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Now, we add the number of geraniums and petunias to find the total number of flowers.

Total flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total flowers = 90 + 50

The combined rate is 4 (Kalinda's rate) + 2 (her mom's rate) = 6 pieces per minute.

Since there are 360 pieces in the puzzle, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the combined rate to find the time it will take to complete the puzzle.

Time = Total pieces / Combined rate
Time = 360 / 6
Time = 60 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

Time in hours = 60 / 60
Time in hours = 1 hour

Therefore, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

The final answer is: 1"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, there were 120 baby watermelons. After two months, 30% of them were ready for harvest. 

30% of 120 is 0.3 * 120 = 36. So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest after two months.

This means that 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons were not ready for harvest after two months.

When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 melons were ready for harvest. 

3/4 of 84 is (3/4) * 84 = 63. So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks.

This means that 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees.

The total cost of the cars is the price of one car multiplied by the number of cars: 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.

The tax on the cars is 10% of the total cost of the cars: 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000.

The registration fees are $1000 per car, so the total registration fees are: 12 * $1000 = $12,000.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

The final answer is: $276,000."
"To find out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we first need to determine how many shells she collected on Monday. We know that Robert collected 20 shells on Monday and Kylie collected 5 more than Robert. 

So, Kylie collected 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. To find out how many shells she collected on Tuesday, we multiply the number of shells she collected on Monday by 2.

25 * 2 = 50

Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesday."
"To find the total number of insects in the garden, we first need to determine the number of bugs. Since Dax found half as many bugs as ants, and there were 50 ants, we can calculate the number of bugs as follows:

Number of bugs = Number of ants / 2
Number of bugs = 50 / 2
Number of bugs = 25

Now, to find the total number of insects in the garden, we add the number of ants and bugs:

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
Total number of insects = 50 + 25
Total number of insects = 75

The final answer is: 75"
"To find the number of penguins left sunbathing, we need to determine how many penguins are not in the ocean or the cave. 

First, let's find out how many penguins jump in the ocean. One-third of 36 is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins. 

Next, let's find out how many penguins go inside the cave. Another one-third of 36 is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins.

Now, we need to find the total number of penguins that are either in the ocean or the cave. This is 12 (ocean) + 12 (cave) = 24 penguins.

To find the number of penguins left sunbathing, we subtract the number of penguins in the ocean and the cave from the total number of penguins. This is 36 (total) - 24 (ocean and cave) = 12 penguins.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many tomatoes Steve eats in a week and then divide that by the number of tomatoes a vine can produce per week.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, he eats 6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes per week.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half as much as Steve, which is 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes per week.

The total number of tomatoes they eat per week is 42 (Steve) + 21 (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes per week.

Since each vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed is 63 / 3 = 21 vines.

The final answer is: 21"
"To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we need to calculate the total number of slices required and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

First, let's find the total number of slices needed: 
20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices

Since pizzas are sold in 8 slices, we need to divide the total number of slices by 8 to find the number of pizzas:
80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas

So, John needs to order 10 pizzas to ensure each of his 20 friends gets 4 slices. 

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Ram starts with 25 pens. He uses 5 pens to make 1 new pen, so he gets 1 new pen. Now, he has 25 - 5 = 20 pens left. He uses 5 of the remaining 20 pens to make 1 new pen, so he gets 1 new pen. Now, he has 20 - 5 = 15 pens left. He continues this process until he has used up all the pens.

To find the total number of new pens he gets, we can see a pattern. In each step, he gets 1 new pen and uses 5 old pens. So, the number of new pens he gets is equal to the number of times he can divide 25 by 5, which is 5. 

However, this is not the total number of pens he has. We need to add the initial 25 pens to the new pens he gets. 

The total number of pens he gets is 25 (initial pens) + 5 (new pens) = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the final amount of money Johnny had after a year, we need to follow the steps of the problem.

1. Johnny started with $20 and added an extra $10, so his total amount of money is $20 + $10 = $30.
2. He then invested this sum of money, which tripled in a year. This means we need to multiply the current amount by 3 to find the final amount.

So, we multiply $30 by 3 to get the final amount.

$30 * 3 = $90

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we need to determine the ages of Mary and Joan first.

Since Jessa is 20 years old, and Joan is five years older than Jessa, we can calculate Joan's age by adding 5 to Jessa's age: 20 + 5 = 25.

Now, we know that Mary is two years younger than Joan, so we can calculate Mary's age by subtracting 2 from Joan's age: 25 - 2 = 23.

Now that we have the ages of all three girls, we can find the sum of their ages by adding their individual ages together: 20 (Jessa) + 23 (Mary) + 25 (Joan) = 68.

The final answer is: 68"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of students who went out through exit A, then the number of students remaining, and finally, the number of students who went out through exit C.

First, let's find the number of students who went out through exit A. 30% of 1000 students went out through exit A. 

30% of 1000 = 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students.

Now, let's find the number of students remaining after 300 students went out through exit A. 

Remaining students = Total students - Students who went out through exit A
= 1000 - 300
= 700 students.

Next, 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B. 

3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students.

Now, let's find the number of students who went out through exit C. 

Students who went out through exit C = Remaining students - Students who went out through exit B
= 700 - 420
= 280 students.

The final answer is: 280"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that John has 54 candies and that he has twice as many candies as Robert. 

To find out how many candies Robert has, we can divide the number of candies John has by 2. 

Robert's candies = John's candies / 2
Robert's candies = 54 / 2
Robert's candies = 27

We also know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. 

James' candies = Robert's candies + 6
James' candies = 27 + 6
James' candies = 33

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. 

Difference = John's candies - James' candies
Difference = 54 - 33
Difference = 21

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Dolly has 2 books and Pandora has 1 book. 

Dolly will read her own 2 books and Pandora's 1 book, so Dolly will read a total of 3 books.

Pandora will read her own 1 book and Dolly's 2 books, so Pandora will read a total of 3 books.

In total, they will read 3 (Dolly's total) + 3 (Pandora's total) = 6 books.

However, we need to consider that they also read each other's books. So, Dolly will read Pandora's book and Pandora will read Dolly's book. This means they will read 2 more books.

Therefore, the total number of books they will read is 6 (initial books) + 2 (additional books) = 8 books.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he writes and then multiply it by the time it takes him to write each letter.

First, let's find out how many letters Mike writes in a week. He has 3 pen pals left, and each of them sends 2 letters a week. So, the total number of letters he receives is 3 * 2 = 6 letters.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages he writes in a week is 6 (letters he sends) * 5 (pages per letter) = 30 pages.

Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 30 pages * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.

Therefore, Mike spends 3 hours writing a week.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to calculate the total minutes used and subtract that from his total plan minutes.

First, let's calculate the total minutes used for the daily calls with his boss. Since Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day and there are 30 days in the month, the total minutes used for these calls is:

15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

Next, we add the extra 300 minutes used for calls with other people:

450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from Jason's total plan minutes:

1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

So, Jason has 250 minutes left.

The final answer is: 250"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Griffin had 24 fries. 

Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin. So, Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which means Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Ginger gave Griffin a certain number of fries, let's call it 'x'. After that, Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, Colby took 2 fries from Griffin.

Now, Griffin has 9 + x - 2 = 27 fries. 

To find the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin, we need to solve the equation: 9 + x - 2 = 27.

9 + x - 2 = 27
x = 27 + 2 - 9
x = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2 * 2x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

28 = 4x

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

x = 7

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the total hours worked. The makeup artist works 6 hours a day, 4 times a week, for 5 weeks. 

Total hours worked per week = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week
Total hours worked in 5 weeks = 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour. 

Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. 

Discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000

Total amount Jean paid = Total cost before discount - Discount amount
= $30,000 - $3,000
= $27,000

"To find out how much each person paid, we need to first calculate the total cost of the party supplies. 

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the cake, presents, decorations, invitations, and goodie bags. 

Total cost = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are 3 people in total. 

To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3.

$96 Ã· 3 = $32

Each person paid $32."
"To find out how much the chef spent, we need to calculate the total weight of the onions and then multiply it by the cost per pound.

The chef bought 4 bags of onions, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. So, the total weight of the onions is:
4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

Since a pound of onions costs $1.50, the total cost is:
200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

The chef spent $300."
"To find out how many calories Sue consumed, we first need to determine how many cookies she ate. 

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies, so Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 13 cookies, so Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

In total, Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies. 

Her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories, and her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

The difference in calories consumed is 9200 - 3600 = 5600."
"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the school. Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60.

Given that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls, the total number of girls in the school is 15 + 12 = 27. 

Since the school is 50% girls, the total number of boys in the school is also 60 - 27 = 33.

Now, we need to find the number of girls in the third class. Since the school is 50% girls, the third class should also have 50% girls. The total number of students in the third class is 20, so the number of girls in the third class is 20 * 0.5 = 10.

Now, we can find the number of boys in the third class by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of students in the third class: 20 - 10 = 10.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. 

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's represent the number of cougars killed today as 'x'. Then, the number of wolves killed today is 3x.

We also know that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, the number of cougars killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since we know the number of cougars killed today is 12, we can set up the equation 3x = 12 to find the number of wolves killed today. Solving for x, we get x = 4. However, this is the number of cougars, not wolves. We already know that the number of wolves killed today is 3x, so the number of wolves killed today is 3 * 4 = 12.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals killed. Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars, for a total of 25 animals. Today, Rick killed 12 wolves and 12 cougars, for a total of 24 animals.

The total number of animals killed is 25 + 24 = 49.

30% of 30 is 0.3 x 30 = 9. 

So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Since Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne, we multiply the number of times Anne went down by 4.

21 x 4 = 84

Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

Initially, each stall had 20 cows. Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and divided them equally among the 10 stalls. 

To find out how many cows he added to each stall, we divide the total number of new cows (40) by the number of stalls (10). 

40 / 10 = 4

So, Mr. Sylas added 4 cows to each stall. 

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. We know that each stall has 20 original cows and 4 new cows. 

20 (original cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows per stall

Since we want to find out how many cows are in 8 stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8.

24 * 8 = 192

"To find the total weight of the redwood tree, we first need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections. Since the tree is 200 feet tall, we divide 200 by 10 to get the number of sections.

200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so we multiply the number of sections by the weight per section to get the total weight.

20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds

However, termites ate 30% of the wood, so we need to subtract 30% of the total weight from the total weight to find the remaining weight.

30% of 8000 pounds = 0.3 * 8000 = 2400 pounds

"To determine the total amount of flour needed, we need to calculate the amount of flour required for each day and then add them together.

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens are in 36 cookies. 

36 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 3 dozen cookies

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 1 dozen cookies, we multiply the number of dozens by 2 to find the total amount of flour needed for today.

3 dozen cookies * 2 cups per dozen = 6 cups of flour for today

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. Again, we need to find out how many dozens are in 30 cookies.

30 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 2.5 dozen cookies

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 1 dozen cookies, we multiply the number of dozens by 2 to find the total amount of flour needed for tomorrow.

2.5 dozen cookies * 2 cups per dozen = 5 cups of flour for tomorrow

To find the value of two-thirds of 9,300, we can multiply 9,300 by 2 and then divide by 3.

First, multiply 9,300 by 2: 9,300 * 2 = 18,600

Then, divide 18,600 by 3: 18,600 / 3 = 6,200

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we can multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount.

"To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, then add them to the selling price.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500.

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

The total price of the house is the sum of the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

First, we know it takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees. Then, it takes 40% longer to heat up to 400 degrees. 

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.

After warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. It took 28 minutes to warm up the oil, so it will take 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is the sum of the time it took to warm up the oil and the time it took to cook. 

Total time = 28 minutes (to warm up the oil) + 23 minutes (to cook) = 51 minutes.

The final answer is: 51"
"To find the total amount spent on newspaper ads, we multiply the cost per ad by the number of ads: $5 * 50 = $250.

To find the total amount spent on television ads, we multiply the cost per ad by the number of ads: $75 * 15 = $1125.

Now, we add the total amount spent on newspaper ads and television ads to find the overall amount spent: $250 + $1125 = $1375.

The final answer is: $1375"
"To find the number of blue golf balls, we first need to determine the total number of golf balls. Since half of the balls are golf balls, and the juggler can juggle 16 balls, the number of golf balls is 16 / 2 = 8.

Now, we know that half of the golf balls are blue. So, the number of blue golf balls is 8 / 2 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then add them together.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag together: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

The final answer is: 762"
"To find the total number of windows, we need to calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows in each house.

Each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows. So, the total number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is 3 * 2 = 6.

There are 4 additional windows in each house not connected to bedrooms.

So, the total number of windows in one house is 6 (from bedrooms) + 4 (additional) = 10.

Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows is 10 * 2 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost of the items, we need to add the cost of cocoa, laundry, and pasta. 

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35
Total cost = $14.00

Since the mother pays $20, we need to find the change. 

Change = Amount paid - Total cost
Change = $20 - $14.00
Change = $6.00

The final answer is: $6.00"
"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we first need to determine the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette. 

The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is 900 * 0.1 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is a 1800-stitch project, the total number of stitches used for the body and the sleeves is 1800 - 270 = 1530 stitches.

The body takes 900 stitches, so the number of stitches used for the sleeves is 1530 - 900 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2 to find the number of stitches for each sleeve: 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

The final answer is: 315"
"To find the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan spent on seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately and then add them together.

The cost of the tomato seeds is 20 packets * $40 per packet = $800.

The cost of the celery seeds is 80 packets * $30 per packet = $2400.

The total cost of the seeds is $800 + $2400 = $3200.

The final numerical answer is: $3200"
"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each scene and the song, and then add them together.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

The final answer is: 138"
"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to calculate the number of cards that had the letters A, B, and C, and then subtract that from the total number of cards.

First, we find the number of cards with the letter A: 2/5 of 80 is (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards.

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B. Since 32 cards had the letter A, we subtract that from the total: 80 - 32 = 48 cards. Then, 1/2 of the remaining 48 cards had the letter B: (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards.

Now, we find the number of cards with the letter C. Since 32 cards had the letter A and 24 cards had the letter B, we subtract those from the total: 80 - 32 - 24 = 24 cards. Then, 5/8 of the remaining 24 cards had the letter C: (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards.

Now, we add up the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C: 32 + 24 + 15 = 71 cards.

Finally, we subtract the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C from the total number of cards to find the number of cards with the letter D: 80 - 71 = 9 cards.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

Time for small holes: 3 minutes per hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes
Time for large holes: 10 minutes per hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

Total time in minutes: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 
240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we first need to determine their current ages. Since the sum of their ages is 20, we can represent their ages as x and 20 - x.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be x + 10 and Marco's age will be (20 - x) + 10, which simplifies to 30 - x.

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (x + 10) + (30 - x), which simplifies to 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S. We are given two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: R = 6S
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: (R + 9) = 3(S + 9)

We can substitute the first equation into the second one to solve for S:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 3S from both sides:

3S + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:

3S = 18

Divide both sides by 3:

S = 6

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total amount Peter paid, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars separately and then add them together.

The cost of the popsicles is 20 * $0.25 = $5.
The cost of the ice cream bars is 4 * $0.50 = $2.

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars together: $5 + $2 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To find the total number of spots on the cobras, we need to multiply the number of cobras by the number of spots each cobra has. 

Number of cobras: 40
Number of spots per cobra: 70
Total spots on cobras: 40 * 70 = 2800

Since the mambas have half the number of spots as the cobras, we can find the number of spots per mamba by dividing the number of spots per cobra by 2.

Number of spots per mamba: 70 / 2 = 35

Now, we can find the total number of spots on the mambas by multiplying the number of mambas by the number of spots per mamba.

Number of mambas: 60
Number of spots per mamba: 35
Total spots on mambas: 60 * 35 = 2100

To find the total number of spots on all the snakes, we add the total spots on the cobras and the mambas.

Total spots on all snakes: 2800 + 2100 = 4900

Finally, to find half the number of spots they all have combined, we divide the total number of spots by 2.

Half the total spots: 4900 / 2 = 2450"
"To find out how many pizzas Maddy needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of people she needs to serve. 

There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of people from the team and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. 

Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. 

The total number of people Maddy needs to serve is 15 (team and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, the total number of pizzas needed is 39 / 3 = 13.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total amount Maddy will spend is 13 * 15 = $195.

The final answer is: $195"
"To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we first need to calculate the total space occupied by the topaz gemstones and the remaining space that will be filled by the sterling silver beads.

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 gemstones per necklace. So, the total space occupied by the gemstones is 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. To find the remaining space for the sterling silver beads, we subtract the space occupied by the gemstones from the total length of the necklace:

25 inches (total length) - 8 inches (space occupied by gemstones) = 17 inches

Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long. To find the number of beads that can fit in the remaining space, we divide the remaining space by the length of each bead:

17 inches / 0.25 inches (length of each bead) = 68

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find the total number of stories written in the first week, we need to add the number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot.

Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week.
Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week.
Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week.

Total stories in the first week = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week. 

Alani doubled her stories from 20 to 20 * 2 = 40.
Braylen doubled his stories from 40 to 40 * 2 = 80.
Margot doubled her stories from 60 to 60 * 2 = 120.

Total stories in the second week = 40 + 80 + 120 = 240

To find the total number of stories written altogether, we need to add the total number of stories written in the first week and the second week.

Total stories = Total stories in the first week + Total stories in the second week
Total stories = 120 + 240
Total stories = 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To find the current age of Ann's brother, we need to multiply Ann's age by 2.

"To find out how many cents Kelly has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has and subtract the cost of the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, which is equivalent to 5 x 25 cents = 125 cents. She also has 2 dimes, which is equivalent to 2 x 10 cents = 20 cents. 

So, the total amount of money Kelly has is 125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents.

Now, let's subtract the cost of the can of pop, which is 55 cents. 

145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the number of rows of 5-star stars, we first need to determine the total number of stars in the flag. We know that there are three rows of 8 stars and two rows of 6 stars. 

The total number of stars in the 8-star rows is 3 * 8 = 24 stars.
The total number of stars in the 6-star rows is 2 * 6 = 12 stars.

Now, we can find the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows by adding them together: 24 + 12 = 36 stars.

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, we can find the number of stars in the 5-star rows by subtracting the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total number of stars: 76 - 36 = 40 stars.

Now, we need to find the number of rows of 5-star stars. We can do this by dividing the total number of stars in the 5-star rows by 5: 40 / 5 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the number of trucks needed, we need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones and divide it by the weight capacity of each truck.

First, let's find the total weight of the flagstones: 
80 flagstones * 75 pounds per flagstone = 6000 pounds

Now, let's divide the total weight by the weight capacity of each truck:
6000 pounds / 2000 pounds per truck = 3

So, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final answer is: 3"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since it's traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, we can calculate it as follows:

Speed of the car in the fast lane = 60 miles/hour
Speed of the car in the slow lane = 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour

Now, we know the distance covered by both cars is the same, which is 480 miles. We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

For the car in the fast lane:
Time = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours

Since the car in the slow lane travels at half the speed, it will take twice the time to cover the same distance. Therefore, the time taken by the car in the slow lane is:

Time = 8 hours * 2 = 16 hours

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

It's given that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have. Let's represent the total number of medals given out as 'x'. Then, we can write the equation:

39 = x / 10

To find 'x', we multiply both sides of the equation by 10:

x = 39 * 10
x = 390

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390.

The final answer is: 390"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many chocolate bars are available in total. Since each packet contains 5 chocolate bars and there are 8 packets, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

We know that each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults. So, the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

Now, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars: 40 - 24 = 16.

Since there are 8 children, we need to divide the remaining chocolate bars equally among them. To do this, we divide 16 by 8, which gives us 2.

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

First, let's find the total time she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

3 hours (working time) - 0.5 hours (pause time) = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the total working time to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:

150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 per interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval:

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

So, Susan earns $75 for the online task.

The final answer is: $75"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Mike has 21 points after 3 rounds.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

Now, let's calculate the points after the fourth round. In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.

- Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point, making it 21 + 1 = 22 points.
- Jim has 18 points, so he doesn't get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point, making it 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players: 22 (Mike) + 18 (Jim) + 43 (Tony) = 83 points.

The final answer is: 83"
"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we first need to determine how many oranges the sons washed. The oldest son is 8 years old, and he washes 8 oranges. The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. He washes 4 oranges.

In total, the sons wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges. Will bought 15 oranges, so to find out how many are left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges: 15 - 12 = 3.

"To find the total count of activities, we need to calculate the number of exercises done on each day and then add them together.

On the first day, Darren did:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

On the second day, he did:
- 20 more pushups than the first day, so 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 10 fewer squats than the first day, so 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- Doubled the number of dumbbell presses, so 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Now, let's add up the exercises for each day:
Day 1: 100 + 50 + 20 = 170
Day 2: 120 + 40 + 40 = 200

Total count of activities in two days: 170 + 200 = 370

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then divide the total amount of rice available by this daily consumption.

First, let's calculate the daily consumption of rice. Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner). So, the daily consumption per person is 0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals = 0.4 kg/day.

Since there are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total daily consumption is 0.4 kg/day * 5 people = 2 kg/day.

Now, let's calculate how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. We can do this by dividing the total amount of rice available (42 kg) by the daily consumption (2 kg/day).

42 kg / 2 kg/day = 21 days

Since we want to know how many weeks the rice will last, we need to convert the number of days to weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so we can divide the number of days by 7.

21 days / 7 days/week = 3 weeks

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first need to calculate the total number of crates he sold in the week. 

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he sold bread for 5 days. 

He sold 20 crates over the weekend, which is 2 days. 
He sold 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday.

Total crates sold = 20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) = 65 crates

Since Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, he had 5 working days. His target for the week is 120 crates. 

To find out how many crates he should have sold in 5 days, we can divide the target by 7 and multiply by 5. 

Target per day = 120 / 7 = 17.14 (approximately)
Crates he should have sold in 5 days = 17.14 * 5 = 85.7 (approximately)

However, since we can't sell a fraction of a crate, we will consider the nearest whole number, which is 85 crates.

Now, let's find out how many crates he was off from his target. 

Crates he was off from target = Target - Crates sold = 120 - 65 = 55

So, Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week.

The final answer is: 55"
"To find the total cost of the desk, we need to determine the last bid made by Carmen. 

Since there are 3 other people who bid once, and Carmen bids after each of them, there are a total of 4 bids made by the other 3 people.

"To calculate the total cost, we need to find the total miles driven per year, the total cost per year for the miles driven, and the total bonus per year.

First, let's find the total miles driven per year. Since John goes to work 30 miles away and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 30 * 2 = 60 miles. He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total miles driven per year is 60 * 5 * 50 = 15,000 miles.

The cost per mile is $2, so the total cost per year for the miles driven is 15,000 * $2 = $30,000.

John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus per year is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

The total cost per year for driving is the sum of the cost for the miles driven and the bonus, which is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The final numerical answer is: $31,800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to add the minutes he exercised on both days. 

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined minutes by 2.

Combined minutes: 39
Twice the combined minutes: 39 * 2 = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

The final answer is: 78"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the folding process. When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two layers: the front and the back. 

In a 32-page tabloid, we have 32 pages in total. When folded, each page is printed on both the front and the back of the paper. However, the first and last pages (pages 1 and 32) will be printed on the outside of the fold, while the remaining pages (2-31) will be printed on the inside of the fold.

Since the first and last pages are printed on the outside, they will be on separate pieces of paper. The remaining 30 pages (2-31) will be printed on the inside of the fold, which means they will be on the same piece of paper.

Therefore, we need 2 pieces of paper for the first and last pages, and 1 piece of paper for the remaining 30 pages.

The total number of pieces of paper needed is 2 + 1 = 3.

"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on food and snacks, and then subtract that from the initial amount she brought.

Annika spent half of $50 on food and snacks, which is 50 / 2 = $25.

She also spent an additional $10 on rides.

So, the total amount she spent is $25 (food and snacks) + $10 (rides) = $35.

Now, let's subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount she brought: $50 - $35 = $15.

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to first determine how many books she sold in the first year and the second year.

We know that Elise sold 45 books this year. Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We also know that she has sold a total of 250 - 50 = 200 books in the first two years. Since she sold 90 books in the first year, she sold 200 - 90 = 110 books in the second year.

Each book sells for $20, so the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 110 * 20 = $2200.

The final answer is: $2200"
"To calculate Watson's total earnings for April, we need to calculate his daily earnings, weekly earnings, and then multiply it by the number of weeks in April.

Watson works 10 hours a day and earns $10 per hour, so his daily earnings are:
10 hours/day * $10/hour = $100/day

Since Watson works 5 days a week, his weekly earnings are:
$100/day * 5 days/week = $500/week

In April, there are 4 weeks. If the company performed very well for the whole month, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week. So, his total weekly earnings for April are:
$500/week + $300/week = $800/week

Now, we multiply his total weekly earnings by the number of weeks in April:
$800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April.

The final answer is: $3200"

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 

Two-thirds of 60 is calculated as (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves. 

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning. 

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

The total number of loaves produced is 60, and 40 are sold in the morning. 

60 - 40 = 20 loaves are left after the morning sales.

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. 

Half of 20 is calculated as (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are equally divided between the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses per week and then multiply that by the number of weeks it takes Sandy to lose the same amount of weight.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight Joey loses per week, we divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks:

8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we multiply the weight lost per week by the number of weeks it takes Sandy:

2 pounds per week * 4 weeks = 8 pounds

However, the question asks how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, not the amount of weight itself. Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, the answer is 4 weeks.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

The original price of one tub of ice cream is $13, and it's now sold at $11. The discount on one tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $2.

Since you're buying 2 tubs of ice cream, the total discount on the ice cream is 2 * $2 = $4.

The original price of one packet of milk is not given, but we know that it was sold at a discount of $0.5. Let's assume the original price of one packet of milk is x. The discounted price of one packet of milk is x - $0.5.

Since you're buying 4 packets of milk, the total discount on the milk is 4 * ($x - $0.5).

However, we don't know the original price of the milk packet. To find the total savings, we need to know the original price of the milk packet. 

But, we can express the total savings as an equation: Total Savings = (2 * $2) + 4 * ($x - $0.5).

Since we don't have the value of x, we can't provide a numerical answer."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs grown after 15 days.

The serum grows an extra arm every 3 days. To find out how many arms are grown in 15 days, we divide 15 by 3. 

15 / 3 = 5

So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

The serum grows an extra leg every 5 days. To find out how many legs are grown in 15 days, we divide 15 by 5.

15 / 5 = 3

So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

To find the total number of new limbs, we add the number of extra arms and legs.

5 (extra arms) + 3 (extra legs) = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount spent by Theo on the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket, and then subtract this amount from the total amount he has, $6000. We also need to subtract the amount he wants to save, $2000.

First, let's calculate the cost of the business suits:
6 suits * $100 each = $600

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50 each = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
Cost of a business suit = $100
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
Cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's calculate the total amount spent by Theo on the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket:
$600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent and the amount he wants to save from the total amount he has:
$6000 - $1950 (total spent) - $2000 (amount to save) = $1050

So, Theo has $1050 to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

The final answer is: $1050"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a day and then multiply it by 7 to get the total number of eggs consumed in a week.

First, let's find out how many people eat 3 eggs each day and how many people eat 2 eggs each day. 

There are 5 people in the family. If 3 people eat 3 eggs each day, then the total number of eggs consumed by these 3 people is 3 * 3 = 9 eggs. 

The remaining people are 5 - 3 = 2. These 2 people eat 2 eggs each day, so the total number of eggs consumed by these 2 people is 2 * 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add the total number of eggs consumed by both groups: 9 + 4 = 13 eggs per day.

To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: 91"
"To find Trent's age, we need to first determine Jane's age. Since Quinn is 30 and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, we can calculate Jane's age by subtracting 3 from Quinn's age.

Jane's age = Quinn's age - 3
Jane's age = 30 - 3
Jane's age = 27

Now that we know Jane's age, we can find Trent's age. Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so we can calculate Trent's age by adding 5 to Jane's age.

Trent's age = Jane's age + 5
Trent's age = 27 + 5
Trent's age = 32

The final answer is: 32"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
2. At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.
3. The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, so it was 3000 * 20 = 60000.
4. Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, the current population is 2 * 60000 = 120000.

The final answer is: 120000"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is D/2.

We know that the total number of players on the team is 105. The sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams is equal to 105. 

So, we can write the equation: 2D + D + D/2 = 105.

To solve for D, we need to get rid of the fraction. Multiplying the entire equation by 2 will eliminate the fraction: 4D + 2D + D = 210.

Combining like terms, we get 7D = 210.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get D = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of people invited, we first need to calculate the number of people from the 2 families with 6 people and the 3 families with 4 people.

For the 2 families with 6 people, the total number of people is 2 * 6 = 12.
For the 3 families with 4 people, the total number of people is 3 * 4 = 12.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. So, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

Now, 1/4 of the people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments. 1/4 of 8 is 2. So, we subtract 2 from the number of people who couldn't come due to illness: 8 - 2 = 6.

The total number of people who couldn't come is 6. We subtract this from the total number of people invited: 24 - 6 = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, his father gave him 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 (initial marbles) + 20 (bought from Johanna) + 8 (given by his father) = 98 marbles.

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of marbles is 98 * 2 = 196 kgs.

The final answer is: 196"
"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as a pool) is length x width x height.

Given dimensions: 
- Length (L) = 6 feet
- Width (W) = 4 feet
- Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume = L x W x H = 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet

Now, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. 

Cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot
= 120 cubic feet x $0.1/cubic foot
= $12

The final answer is: $12"
"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we first need to determine the number of girls and nongendered children.

Given that there are 30 boys, and the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:
Girls = 3 * Boys = 3 * 30 = 90

Next, we are told that the classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys. To find the number of nongendered children, we can multiply the number of boys by 1/10:
Nongendered children = 1/10 * Boys = 1/10 * 30 = 3

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
Total children = Boys + Girls + Nongendered children = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123

The final answer is: 123"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Let's denote the number of electric poles as 'x'. According to the given ratio, the number of electric wires will be 3x.

We are given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

3x = 45

To find the value of 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required by the electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of people who left the party. We know that 1/4 of the total number of people left, and 22 men stayed. 

Let's denote the total number of people as 'x'. Since 1/4 of the people left, 3/4 of the people stayed. We can set up the equation:

3/4 * x = 22 + (number of women who stayed)

We know that the total number of people at the beginning was 25 men + 15 women = 40 people. So, x = 40.

Now, we can substitute x = 40 into the equation:

3/4 * 40 = 22 + (number of women who stayed)

30 = 22 + (number of women who stayed)

Subtract 22 from both sides:

8 = (number of women who stayed)

Since there were 15 women at the beginning, we can find the number of women who left:

15 - 8 = 7 women left

The total number of women who stayed is 8, but the question asks for the number of women left, which is 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the cost of the pen, we need to first determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, we know that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. So, the cost of the pen is $2 - $1 = $1.

The final numerical answer is: $1"
"To find the total number of pencils Jam has, we know she has 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. Since we know the number of loose pencils, we can find the number of pencils in the boxes by subtracting the loose pencils from the total: 26 - 2 = 24 pencils in the boxes.

Since each box contains the same number of pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils in the boxes by the number of boxes to find the number of pencils in each box: 24 / 3 = 8 pencils per box.

Now, we know Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each, which is 3 * 8 = 24 pencils. We also know Meg has 46 pencils. To find the total number of pencils, we add the pencils Jam and Meg have: 24 + 46 = 70 pencils.

To find the number of boxes needed to store all the pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box: 70 / 8 = 8.75. Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure all pencils fit. Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weakening effect of the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, so the number of ice cubes needed is:

65 / 13 = 5

Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, 5 ice cubes will make it 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Next, we need to consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. Since any added liquid weakens the coffee, the total weakening effect of the cream is 15 milliliters.

Now, we add the weakening effects of the ice cubes and the cream to find the total weakening effect:

60 milliliters (from ice cubes) + 15 milliliters (from cream) = 75 milliliters

The final answer is: 75"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Since 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can infer that the total number of new records traded is 7. Given the trade ratio of 2 old records for 1 new record, the total number of old records traded must be twice the number of new records traded.

So, the total number of old records traded is 7 * 2 = 14.

Since there are 5 people, and they brought in the old records, we can divide the total number of old records traded by the number of people to find out how many old records each person brought in. However, the question asks for the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people.

Therefore, the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people is 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of junior programmers and the number of senior programmers. 

The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 100. So, the number of junior programmers is 2/5 * 100 = 40.

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60.

The junior programmers are each paid $2000 per month, so the total amount paid to junior programmers is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so they are paid $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

The total amount paid to senior programmers is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

The total amount paid to all programmers is the sum of the amount paid to junior and senior programmers, which is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

The final answer is: $224,000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as 'x'.

Initially, there were x people on the bus.

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total number of people became x + 5.

At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the total number of people became (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2.

Then, 8 more people got in, so the total number of people became (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6.

We are given that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20, so we can set up the equation:

x + 6 = 20

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:

x = 20 - 6
x = 14

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to first determine how many percentage points are left to charge. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more to be fully charged.

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it takes to charge 40% as follows:

40 percentage points / 1 percentage point per 3 minutes = 40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to start with the initial number of lollipops she had, which is 7. Then, we add the number of lollipops her mother gave her, which is 10. This gives us a total of 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops. 

After that, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella. To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to subtract the number of lollipops she gave away from the total number of lollipops she had. So, 17 - 3 = 14.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip, apply the rewards and the coupon to the current shopping trip, and then find the final amount paid.

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip, which means they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards. 

On this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards. Since they had 4 rewards, they used $4 off the price. 

The coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is 2 * $4 = $8. 

So, the total discount applied is $4 (from rewards) + $8 (from the coupon) = $12.

The final amount paid is $43 (initial price) - $12 (total discount) = $31.

"To determine which job pays more, we need to calculate the net pay for each job.

For Job A, the total income is $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year. The state tax rate is 20%, so the tax amount is $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000. The net pay for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

For Job B, the total income is $42,000/year. The property tax is $6,000, so the net income before taxes is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. The state tax rate is 10%, so the tax amount is $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600. The net pay for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

To find the difference in net pay between the two jobs, we subtract the net pay of Job A from the net pay of Job B: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final numerical answer is: $8,400"
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we first need to find the total number of ruined castles. 

40% of the castles are ruins, so we multiply the total number of castles by 0.4 (which is the decimal form of 40%):

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the stock price after the first year and then after the second year.

Initially, Maria buys 8 shares for $8 each, so the total cost is 8 * 8 = $64.

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price, we multiply the original price by 1.5 (100% + 50% = 150%, or 1 + 0.5 = 1.5). 

New price after the first year = $8 * 1.5 = $12.

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. To find the new price, we multiply the price after the first year by 0.75 (100% - 25% = 75%, or 1 - 0.25 = 0.75).

New price after the second year = $12 * 0.75 = $9.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as 'x'. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is 'x - 10'.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

Since the smallest group has 'x - 10' students, we can find the number of students in the smallest group by subtracting 10 from x:

x - 10 = 70 - 10

"To solve this problem, we need to find the weights of the blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, and red bird. 

Since the pink frog weighs 50 pounds and it weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, we can conclude that the blue beetle and the green toad also weigh 50 pounds.

The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we can find the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal by adding the weights of all the animals and the container: 50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 50 (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 30 (red bird) + 20 (container) = 260 pounds.

The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day. To find 1/5 of 5000 meters, we multiply 5000 by 1/5, which is 5000 * 0.2 = 1000 meters. 

So, the new daily distance is 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters. 

Since there are 30 days in June, we multiply the new daily distance by 30 to find the total distance covered in June: 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.

The final answer is: 180000"
"To find the price difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B, we first need to determine the price of each juice box.

Juice Box A costs 4 dollars. 
Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it costs 4 + 5 = 9 dollars.
Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it costs 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

Now, we need to find the difference between the price of Juice Box C and Juice Box B. 
The difference is 11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the total number of legs from both types of tables and add them together.

First, let's find the total number of legs from the tables with 4 legs: 
40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs

Next, let's find the total number of legs from the tables with 3 legs: 
50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs

Now, let's add the total number of legs from both types of tables: 
160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs

The final answer is: 310"
"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to first determine how many cookies are used by her son and her husband. 

Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so the total number of cookies her son eats is 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so the total number of cookies her husband eats is 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

The total number of cookies used by her son and her husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since each bag has 36 cookies, and 27 cookies are used by her son and her husband, the number of cookies left for Jenny is 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total cost of the shirts, we first need to calculate the discount amount. The original price of each shirt is $30, and the discount is 40%. 

The discount amount is 40% of $30, which is 0.4 x $30 = $12.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price of each shirt: $30 - $12 = $18.

Since Davos bought 2 shirts, we multiply the discounted price by 2 to get the total cost: $18 x 2 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the percentage increase in the amount of money the factory is making per day, we need to first find the difference in the amount of money they are making per day now and the amount they used to make per day.

The factory used to make $100 per tractor and sold 10 tractors a day, so they made $100 * 10 = $1000 per day.

Now, they make $220 per silo and sell 5 silos a day, so they make $220 * 5 = $1100 per day.

The difference in the amount of money they are making per day now and the amount they used to make per day is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original amount and multiply by 100:

($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the total monthly expenses and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the monthly expenses for food. Since food costs $25 per week and there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly food cost is:
$25/week * 4 weeks/month = $100/month

Now, let's add the monthly costs of treats and medicine to the monthly food cost:
$100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total annual expenses for Madeline's dog are:
$220/month * 12 months/year = $2640/year

The final numerical answer is: $2640"
"To find the total time spent on after-work activities, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and add them up.

- Monday's yoga class is 1 hour.
- Tuesday's cooking class is 3 times as long as Monday's yoga, so it's 1 * 3 = 3 hours.
- Wednesday's cheese-tasting event is 0.5 hours (half an hour).
- Thursday's museum tour is half as long as the cooking class, so it's 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours.
- Friday's errands are 2 hours.

Now, let's add up the time spent on each activity:
1 (Monday) + 3 (Tuesday) + 0.5 (Wednesday) + 1.5 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 7.5 hours.

The final answer is: 7.5"
"To find out how many plant pots April has left over, we first need to determine the total number of plant pots she needs. 

The school asked for 30 plant pots for the daisies. Since they asked for twice as many for the roses, we multiply 30 by 2 to find the number of plant pots needed for the roses. 

30 * 2 = 60

Now, we add the number of plant pots needed for the daisies and the roses to find the total number of plant pots needed. 

30 + 60 = 90

Since April had already bought 100 plant pots, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number she bought to find out how many she has left over.

100 - 90 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent from the initial amount she had. 

First, let's calculate the total amount she spent. She spent $11 on a sweater and gave her brother $4, so the total amount spent is $11 + $4 = $15.

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount she had: $36 - $15 = $21.

Andrea saved $21."
"To find the total time John spent, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them up.

John spent 6 hours boating. He spent half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

He watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The time spent watching shows is 30% of the total time. Let's call the total time 'T'. We can set up the equation: 30% of T = 6 hours. To find T, we can convert 30% to a decimal by dividing by 100: 30 / 100 = 0.3. Now we can solve for T: 0.3T = 6, T = 6 / 0.3, T = 20 hours.

Now that we know the total time, we can find the time spent sightseeing. John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. We can set up the equation: 40% of T = time spent sightseeing. Converting 40% to a decimal: 40 / 100 = 0.4. Now we can solve for the time spent sightseeing: 0.4T = time spent sightseeing, 0.4 * 20 = time spent sightseeing, time spent sightseeing = 8 hours.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and subtract the amount she already has in her savings.

First, let's calculate her earnings from the first job:
20 hours * $10 per hour = $200

Next, let's calculate her earnings from the second job:
15 hours * $5 per hour = $75

Now, let's add her earnings from both jobs:
$200 + $75 = $275

Since she already has $80 in her savings, we need to subtract that from her total earnings to find out how much she still needs to save:
$275 - $80 = $195

So, Annabelle still needs to save $195.

The final answer is: $195"
"To find the height of the tallest tree, we first need to find the combined height of the two shorter trees. The shortest tree is 6 feet tall, and the second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so the second tree is 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall. 

The combined height of the two shorter trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet. 

Since the height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two shorter trees combined, we multiply the combined height by 2. 

The height of the tallest tree is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money he spent and then add the extra $10 his mother gave him.

First, let's calculate the total amount Dean spent on toy cars: 6 toy cars * $2 per toy car = $12.

Next, let's calculate the total amount Dean spent on teddy bears: 5 teddy bears * $1 per teddy bear = $5.

Now, let's add the cost of the toy cars and teddy bears to find the total amount Dean spent: $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially had $28. After spending $17, he had $28 - $17 = $11 left.

His mother then gave him an extra $10, so we add that to the $11 he had left: $11 + $10 = $21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities and then subtract that from Morgan's budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is $5 per round. Since they will play one round, the total cost for mini-golf is $5. 

The cost of the arcade tokens is $5. 

The cost of riding the go-karts twice is 2 * $10 = $20.

The total cost of the activities is $5 (mini-golf) + $5 (arcade tokens) + $20 (go-karts) = $30.

Morgan's budget is $90. To find out how much money is left for her friends, we subtract the total cost of the activities from her budget: $90 - $30 = $60.

Since each friend will not be charged for the activities, the $60 is the amount that can be used to buy something for her friends. However, the question asks for the number of friends she can invite, not the amount of money she can spend on them. 

Since the problem does not specify what she can buy for her friends, we will assume that she can invite as many friends as the budget allows, assuming each friend will get $0. 

However, this is not a practical assumption, as it would not make sense to invite friends if they are not getting anything. A more practical assumption would be that she can invite friends and give them a certain amount of money, but the question does not provide that information.

Given the information provided, we can only assume that she can invite friends and give them $0 each, which is not a practical solution. However, if we assume that she can invite friends and give them a certain amount of money, we would need more information to solve the problem.

"To find out how much money Marisa saves in her piggy bank, we need to calculate the total amount she spends on lollipops and subtract that from the total amount she receives as pocket money.

Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day. She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, so the total amount she spends on lollipops is 4 * 0.25 = $1.

The daily savings would be the difference between her pocket money and the amount spent on lollipops, which is $5 - $1 = $4.

If she saves for 5 days, the total savings would be 5 * $4 = $20.

The final numerical answer is: $20"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much change Billy got after buying the candy. Since he spent $1.5 per pound and he had $10, we can divide $10 by $1.5 to find out how many pounds of candy he bought.

$10 / $1.5 = 6.67 pounds (round down to 6.67, but since you can't buy a fraction of a pound, we'll consider it as 6.67 pounds, but for the sake of calculation, we will use 6.67)

Now, let's calculate the change he got after buying the candy. 

Change = $10 - (6.67 * $1.5) 
Change = $10 - $10 
Change = $0

However, this is not possible since he must have gotten some change. Let's recalculate the change.

Change = $10 - (6 * $1.5) 
Change = $10 - $9 
Change = $1

Now, let's find out how much he spent on gumballs. He spent half of his change, which is $1 / 2 = $0.5.

Since each gumball costs $0.05, we can find out how many gumballs he bought by dividing the amount he spent on gumballs by the cost of each gumball.

Number of gumballs = $0.5 / $0.05
Number of gumballs = 10

However, we are given that he bought 40 gumballs. This means our initial calculation of change was incorrect. Let's recalculate the change.

If he bought 40 gumballs and each costs $0.05, the total cost of gumballs is 40 * $0.05 = $2.

Change = $10 - (6 * $1.5) 
Change = $10 - $9 
Change = $1

However, he spent half of this change on gumballs, which is $0.5. This means the remaining change is $1 - $0.5 = $0.5.

Now, let's find out how much he spent on candy. 

$10 - $0.5 = $9.5

Now, we can find out how many pounds of candy he bought by dividing the amount he spent on candy by the cost per pound.

Number of pounds of candy = $9.5 / $1.5
Number of pounds of candy = 6.33

The final answer is: 6.33"
"To find the age of Carver's son, we need to first determine Carver's age and then calculate the son's age based on the given information.

Let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S. We know that Carver is 45 years old, so C = 45.

The problem states that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. This can be expressed as an equation:

C = 2S - 5

Substituting the value of C, we get:

45 = 2S - 5

To solve for S, we need to isolate S on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding 5 to both sides:

45 + 5 = 2S
50 = 2S

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to find S:

S = 50 / 2
S = 25

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to add the distances between the three cities. The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles, and the distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. 

The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs, which is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. So, the distance from the third city to the first city is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance for one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance the train can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the total distance it travels in a day (900 miles).

18,000 / 900 = 20 days.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the amount of stuffing needed for the collie beds, we first need to calculate the average amount of stuffing between the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds. 

The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds: 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the collie beds: 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

Finally, we add the total amount of stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds: 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time taken for the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the trip and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time taken for the trip to his friend's house. The distance is 200 miles and the speed is 70 mph. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 miles / 70 mph
Time = 2.857 hours (approximately)

However, he had to take a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. So, the actual distance traveled to his friend's house is 200 + 10 = 210 miles. 

Time taken for the detour = 10 miles / 70 mph
Time taken for the detour = 0.143 hours (approximately)

Total time taken to reach his friend's house = 2.857 hours + 0.143 hours
Total time taken to reach his friend's house = 3 hours

Now, let's calculate the time taken for the trip back home. The distance is 240 miles and the speed is 80 mph.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 240 miles / 80 mph
Time = 3 hours

Total time taken for the trip = Time taken to reach his friend's house + Time taken for the trip back home
Total time taken for the trip = 3 hours + 3 hours
Total time taken for the trip = 6 hours

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we first need to find the total number of students present on Friday. 

Total number of fourth-graders = 96
Number of girls = 43
Number of boys = Total number of fourth-graders - Number of girls
Number of boys = 96 - 43 = 53

Now, we know that 5 fourth-grade girls and 4 fourth-grade boys were absent. To find the number of boys present, we subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys.

Number of boys present = Total number of boys - Number of absent boys
Number of boys present = 53 - 4
Number of boys present = 49

The final answer is: 49"
"To find the total number of kids in the park, we first need to determine the number of boys. Since there are twice the number of boys as girls, and there are 6 girls, we can calculate the number of boys by multiplying the number of girls by 2.

Number of boys = 2 * Number of girls
Number of boys = 2 * 6
Number of boys = 12

Now, to find the total number of kids in the park, we add the number of girls and the number of boys.

Total number of kids = Number of girls + Number of boys
Total number of kids = 6 + 12

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as M, the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting as S, and the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as V.

We are given that M = 3.

We are also given that the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting (S) equals four times the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks minus 5. So, S = 4M - 5 = 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7.

We are also given that the number of customers kicked out for physical violence (V) is three times the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting. So, V = 3S = 3(7) = 21.

We are given that a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart. The total number of people kicked out is the sum of the people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence. So, M + S + V = 50.

Substituting the values we found earlier, we get 3 + 7 + 21 = 31. This is the sum of the people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence.

To find the number of people kicked out for other reasons, we subtract the sum from the total number of people kicked out. So, 50 - 31 = 19.

The final answer is: 19"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many points Erin has after scoring 14 points. We know that Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points. 

Let's denote the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points as x. After scoring 14 points, Erin will have x + 14 points. Since Erin now has three times more points than Sara, we can set up the equation:

x + 14 = 3 * 8

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 14 = 24

Subtracting 14 from both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 10

So, Erin had 10 points before scoring 14 points.

The final answer is: 10"
"To calculate the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to break down the costs into different categories.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each picture frame costs $20, and the logo etching costs an additional 20% of the frame's cost. 

20% of $20 is 0.20 * $20 = $4. 
So, the total cost of each picture frame with the logo etching is $20 + $4 = $24.

Since there are 44 seniors, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

Next, 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each. The total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the cords for the officers. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 officers. The cost of the cords for the officers is 11 * $12 = $132.

The total cost of the senior gifts is the sum of the costs of the picture frames, pins, and cords: $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final numerical answer is: $1198"
"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we first need to calculate the materials cost. Since the original price of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400 and making it yourself saves 20%, we can calculate the materials cost as follows:

Original price = $400
Savings = 20% of $400 = 0.20 * $400 = $80
Materials cost = Original price - Savings = $400 - $80 = $320

So, the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

The final answer is: $320"
"To find the total number of tennis shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did the day before, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit, so we need to subtract those from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday. 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add up the total number of shoes sold: 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, we multiply the total number of pairs by 2 to get the total number of shoes sold: 50 * 2 = 100.

The final answer is: 100"

"To find the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to find the value of the faulty pieces. 

The total value of the equipment is $400,000. 40% of this is faulty. 

40% of $400,000 = 0.4 * $400,000 = $160,000

This means the faulty pieces are worth $160,000. 

To find the value of the functioning pieces, we subtract the value of the faulty pieces from the total value.

Value of functioning pieces = Total value - Value of faulty pieces
= $400,000 - $160,000
= $240,000

The total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000.

"To find the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total interest paid over the five months and then divide it by the number of months. 

First, let's find the total interest paid over the five months. The formula for simple interest is:

Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Here, Principal = $3,650, Rate = 10% or 0.10, and Time = 5 months.

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Interest = $1,825

Now, we need to find the total amount Karan has to pay, which is the principal plus the interest.

Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $3,650 + $1,825
Total Amount = $5,475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, we divide the total amount by the number of months.

Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Number of Months
Monthly Payment = $5,475 / 5
Monthly Payment = $1,095

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the total number of pesos each of them has and then add them together.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. 

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. 
Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pesos each of them has:
Axel's total = 50 (silver) + 80 (gold) = 130 pesos
Anna's total = 100 (silver) + 120 (gold) = 220 pesos

The total number of pesos they have together is 130 + 220 = 350.

"To find the total profit per hour, we first need to determine the total revenue and the total cost.

Millie buys supplies for $18 to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups, so she can make 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade. 

She sells each cup for $1, so her total revenue will be 36 * $1 = $36.

Her total cost is $18. 

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue: $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, we need to find out how many hours it takes her to sell all the lemonade. Since she has 36 cups, and she sells 4 cups per hour, it will take her 36 / 4 = 9 hours to sell all the lemonade.

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours: $18 / 9 = $2.

"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the initial amount of land as 'x'. Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he was left with 2/5 of the initial amount. We are given that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation as follows:

2/5 * x = 12.8

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by 5/2 to isolate 'x':

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land initially.

"To find the number of female members in the choir, we first need to calculate 50% of the total members. Since 50% of the choir members are girls, we can find this by multiplying the total number of members by 0.5.

Total members = 52
Number of girls = Total members * 0.5
Number of girls = 52 * 0.5
Number of girls = 26

Now, we know that half the people performing can't make it to the show. This means that only half of the female members will be performing. 

Number of girls performing = Number of girls / 2
Number of girls performing = 26 / 2
Number of girls performing = 13

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. To find the total number of people performing, we add the number of girls performing to the number of teachers.

Total people performing = Number of girls performing + Number of teachers
Total people performing = 13 + 3
Total people performing = 16

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu and add it to the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson.

First, let's find the number of messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Mr. Yu and Ms. Thompson to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu

"To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we first need to find out how many popsicles each of them has. 

Let's assume the number of popsicles Betty has is 5x and the number of popsicles Sam has is 6x. 

Since the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, we can write the equation: 5x + 6x = 165

Combine like terms: 11x = 165

Divide both sides by 11: x = 15

Now that we know x, we can find the number of popsicles each of them has. Betty has 5x = 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles. Sam has 6x = 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15

The builder works 4 weeks every month and 6 days every week. So, the total number of days he works in a month is 4 weeks * 6 days/week = 24 days.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of days he works in a year is 24 days/month * 12 months/year = 288 days/year.

The builder gets paid $50 every day. So, his daily earnings are $50.

Now, we can calculate his yearly earnings by multiplying his daily earnings by the total number of days he works in a year: $50/day * 288 days/year = $14,400/year.

The final answer is: $14,400"
"To find out how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for the quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, we multiply the ingredients by 4:

- Flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
- Milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark will need to buy:
12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark will need to buy:
4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the original energy consumption and the new energy consumption. 

The original energy consumption can be calculated by multiplying the power (watts) by the time (hours) and then converting it to kilowatt-hours (kWh). 

Original energy consumption = 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 Wh or 7.2 kWh per day.

Since 1 kWh = 1000 Wh, we can also express this as 7.2 kWh per day.

If Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, the new time will be 8 - 5 = 3 hours.

New energy consumption = 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh or 2.7 kWh per day.

Now, we can find the energy saved per day by subtracting the new energy consumption from the original energy consumption.

Energy saved per day = 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh.

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the energy saved per day by 30.

Total energy saved in 30 days = 4.5 kWh/day * 30 days = 135 kWh.

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the average number of stripes, we first need to calculate the total number of stripes and then divide it by the total number of zebras.

There are two zebras with 17 stripes each, so that's 2 * 17 = 34 stripes.
There's a zebra with 36 stripes.
There's another zebra with half the number of stripes as the third zebra, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

The total number of stripes is 34 + 36 + 18 = 88.
The total number of zebras is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.

To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the total number of zebras: 88 / 4 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we first need to calculate the total number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves:

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we need a total of 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so the total cost of the meat is:
5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so the total cost of the cheese is:
5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is the sum of the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese:
$35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

The final answer is: $50.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the initial number of corns and cannolis Allan has at home. 

Since Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis and he has 40 cannolis, the initial number of corns is 2 * 40 = 80.

Allan bought 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. So, he bought 60 cannolis and 40 - 60 = -20 corns. However, since you can't have a negative number of corns, this means he actually sold or gave away 20 corns. Therefore, he bought 60 cannolis and 80 - 20 = 60 corns.

Now, we need to find the total number of cannolis and corns Allan has. The total number of cannolis is 40 (initial) + 60 (bought) = 100. The total number of corns is 80 (initial) + 60 (bought) = 140.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 + 140 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"Let's break down the information given. Elliott wants to walk 10,000 steps. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Half of 10,000 is 5,000 steps. 

So, he has completed 5,000 steps. He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. This means he has completed a total of 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Since he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, we can calculate the total steps he took during his jog by adding the remaining steps to the steps he had already completed. 

Total steps taken = 6,000 (already completed) + 2,000 (remaining) = 8,000 steps.

The final answer is: 8000"
"To find out how many minutes Toby will be early, we first need to determine how long it will take him to read the book. 

The book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page, so the total number of words in the book is 45 * 200 = 9000 words.

Toby can read 300 words per minute, so the time it will take him to read the book is 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes.

It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, so the total time Toby will spend is 30 + 10 = 40 minutes.

Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, so the time he will be early is 60 - 40 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is: 20"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to first determine the number of employees and their total hours worked in each month.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours per week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees left. So, the remaining number of employees is 40 - 10 = 30. Each of these employees worked 160 hours in June, and the total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 * $15 = $2400.

The total amount paid to the employees in May is 40 * $2400 = $96,000. The total amount paid to the employees in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

The final answer is: $168,000"
"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means that the second pound is half off, so the cost of the second pound is $3 * 0.5 = $1.5. The total cost of 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.5 = $4.5.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. Sally bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $4.5 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10, so she has $10 - $7 = $3 left.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total amount spent by Tim, we first need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks and the finale firework.

The first package of fireworks costs $400. The second package costs twice as much, so it's 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packages. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 0.20: $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

The discount amount is subtracted from the total cost: $1200 - $240 = $960.

The finale firework costs $150. Adding this to the discounted cost of the fireworks, we get $960 + $150 = $1110.

The total amount spent by Tim is $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we first need to calculate how many cookies she eats in 30 days. 

Since Shannon eats 2 cookies a night, we multiply the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of nights in 30 days. There are 30 nights in 30 days. 

2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since Shannon wants to have enough cookies for 30 days, we need to make sure she has at least 60 cookies. 

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies needed by the number of cookies per recipe. 

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days. 

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. 

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. 5% of the candles smell like wet dog, so we multiply 50000 by 0.05 to get the number of candles that smell like wet dog: 50000 * 0.05 = 2500.

However, the problem states that these candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which means 1% of the candles that smell like wet dog will explode. To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we multiply the number of candles that smell like wet dog by 0.01: 2500 * 0.01 = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to find the price of each blouse after the 30% discount. 

The discount amount is 30% of the regular price, which is 0.3 * $20 = $6. 

So, the discounted price of each blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is 4 * $14 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the tallest trees as T, from the average trees as A, and from the shortest trees as S. 

Since Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees, we have T = 30.

From the shortest trees, she gathered half of 30, which is 15. So, S = 15.

We know that the combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. Let's denote the number of apples Joanne's sister gathered from the tallest trees as 2T and from the shortest trees as 3S.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is T + A + S, and the total number of apples gathered by her sister is 2T + 3S.

Since the combined total is 500, we can write the equation: T + A + S + 2T + 3S = 500.

Substituting the values of T and S, we get 30 + A + 15 + 2(30) + 3(15) = 500.

Simplifying the equation, we get 30 + A + 15 + 60 + 45 = 500.

Combine like terms: 150 + A = 500.

Subtract 150 from both sides: A = 350.

The final answer is: 350"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

We know that the total number of heads is 180, and since each animal has one head, we can write the equation:

C + D = 180

We also know that the total number of bumps is 304, and since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, we can write the equation:

2C + D = 304

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve for C and D by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know C, we can substitute this value into the first equation to solve for D:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

So, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd.

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down the information given.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is 4 * 200 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers. So, the total distance covered in the next two days is 240 kilometers.

On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance covered is 0 kilometers.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance covered in the second week is 7 * 300 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, let's add up the distances covered in each period: 
- First 4 days: 800 kilometers
- Next two days: 240 kilometers
- Next day: 0 kilometers
- Second week: 2100 kilometers

Total distance = 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

The final answer is: 3140"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work backwards from Peter's locker size. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, Zack's locker must be 4 times as big as Peter's locker.

Let's calculate Zack's locker size:
Zack's locker size = 4 * Peter's locker size
Zack's locker size = 4 * 5 cubic inches
Zack's locker size = 20 cubic inches

Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, Timothy's locker must be twice as big as Zack's locker.

Let's calculate Timothy's locker size:
Timothy's locker size = 2 * Zack's locker size
Timothy's locker size = 2 * 20 cubic inches
Timothy's locker size = 40 cubic inches

Elevation where the comb fell: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation where the comb fell and Oliver's elevation to determine how much Oliver needs to climb.

Elevation where the comb fell: 6,000 feet
Oliver's elevation: 3,000 feet
Distance Oliver must climb: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000. 

Now, we add the amount he received from the second bank to his current capital: $9000 + $8000 = $17000.

So, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.
2. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats taken away is 4 * 5 = 20.
3. The remaining cats on the rock are 50 - 20 = 30.
4. Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5, which is (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.
5. The number of cats that ran after the mouse is 18, so the remaining cats on the rock are 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different pricing periods and calculate the cost for each period.

The first 6 months are $8 a month, so the cost for this period is 6 * $8 = $48.

The next 8 months are $12 a month, so the cost for this period is 8 * $12 = $96.

After that, the price increased to $14 a month. Since 2 years is 24 months, and we've already accounted for 14 months, there are 24 - 14 = 10 months left. The cost for this period is 10 * $14 = $140.

Now, we add up the costs for each period: $48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284.

The final answer is: $284"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let the cost of the jogger jeans be x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the cost of the tattered jeans is x + $6.

The total savings is $6, and Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. This means that 1/3 of the total savings is the savings from the jogger jeans, and 2/3 of the total savings is the savings from the tattered jeans.

The savings from the jogger jeans is 1/3 * $6 = $2. The savings from the tattered jeans is 2/3 * $6 = $4.

Since the savings from the tattered jeans is $4, the cost of the tattered jeans is $28 - $4 = $24.

Now we know that the cost of the tattered jeans is $24 and the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. So, the cost of the jogger jeans is $24 - $6 = $18.

The difference in cost between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $24 - $18 = $6.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cards Kenny sold to get the remaining $50. Since he sold the cards for $1.5 each, we can divide $50 by $1.5 to find out how many cards he sold.

$50 / $1.5 = 33.33

However, since we can't sell a fraction of a card, we'll round down to 33 cards. This means Kenny sold 33 cards.

Now, let's find out how many cards he kept. We know that he kept 1/3 of his cards. If we let x be the total number of cards he started with, then 1/3 of x is the number of cards he kept.

1/3 * x = number of cards kept

We also know that the number of cards he kept plus the number of cards he sold equals the total number of cards he started with.

x = number of cards kept + number of cards sold
x = (1/3)x + 33

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction.

3x = 3 * (1/3)x + 3 * 33
3x = x + 99

Now, we can subtract x from both sides to isolate x.

2x = 99

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for x.

x = 99 / 2
x = 49.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a card, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can also consider that Kenny had $50 left after selling the cards, which means he must have sold 33 cards. Therefore, he must have had 49 cards initially, as 49 - 33 = 16, which is 1/3 of 49.

49.5 is the exact number of cards he started with, but since we can't have a fraction of a card, we can round up to 50 or consider the nearest whole number that satisfies the conditions."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, the caterer prepared enough hot dogs for half of the guests to have two hot dogs. Since there are 36 guests, half of them would be 36 / 2 = 18. So, the caterer prepared enough hot dogs for 18 guests to have two hot dogs each.

This means the caterer prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hot dogs for the first 18 guests. However, since the caterer prepared enough for 18 guests to have two hot dogs, the total number of hot dogs prepared is 36.

Now, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog. This means that the 18 guests who were initially supposed to have two hot dogs got their second hot dog, and the remaining 22 guests (40 - 18 = 22) also got a second hot dog.

Since the caterer had prepared 36 hot dogs, and 40 guests got a second hot dog, there are not enough hot dogs for the 40th guest. This means that the 40th guest did not get a second hot dog.

"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount and then apply the 20% discount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The set of pot and pans costs $120.00
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00
- 5 separate utensils at $5.00 each will cost 5 x $5.00 = $25.00
- The total cost of the items before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Now, let's apply the 20% discount to the total cost:

20% of $165.00 is 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00
The discount amount is $33.00

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost:

$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

Dora has a total of $2 (her allowance) + $16 (from her mother) = $18.

To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 (total cost) - $18 (amount she has) = $1.

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to determine how much gas was in each container. Since 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, we can divide 15 by 5 to find the amount in each container.

15 gallons / 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we can convert the 3 gallons to pints by multiplying 3 by 8.

3 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 24 pints

Josey needed 1/4 of a container, so we need to find 1/4 of 24 pints.

1/4 * 24 pints = 6 pints

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George had initially. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can set up an equation to find the initial amount.

Let's denote the initial amount as 'x'. Since 1% of 'x' is equal to $5, we can write the equation as:

0.01x = 5

To find 'x', we can divide both sides by 0.01:

x = 5 / 0.01
x = 500

So, George initially had $500.

Now, let's find out how much he spent on chips. He bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so the total cost of chips is:

3 * 0.40 = $1.20

Since he spent $5 in total, the amount he spent on candy bars is:

5 - 1.20 = $3.80

Now, we need to find out how many candy bars he bought. Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so we can divide the total amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:

3.80 / 0.75 = 5.07

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can buy 5 candy bars for $3.75 and still have $0.05 left, which is not enough to buy another candy bar. Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

"To find the remaining weight of the cake, we need to first determine how much of the cake was eaten. Since Rory and her mom each had a piece, that's 2 pieces in total. 

The cake was cut into 8 pieces, and 2 were eaten, so 8 - 2 = 6 pieces are left. 

Since the cake weighs 20 ounces and it was cut into 8 equal pieces, we can find the weight of each piece by dividing the total weight by the number of pieces: 20 ounces / 8 = 2.5 ounces per piece.

Now, we multiply the weight of one piece by the number of remaining pieces: 2.5 ounces * 6 = 15 ounces.

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces.

"To find out how many oranges each person will get, we need to first calculate the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have. 

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. 

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56

Since they are sharing the oranges with 6 other friends, including themselves, the total number of people sharing the oranges is 8 (Sitti, Juris, and 6 friends).

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people.

Oranges per person = Total oranges / Total people
= 56 / 8
= 7

So, everyone will get 7 oranges. 

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the cost per serving, we first need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients. 

Antoine wants to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which costs 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Since the soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater and then calculate how much earlier she needs to leave than Wayne.

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, Bernadette's drive will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to leave 4 + 5 = 9 minutes before Wayne.

The final numerical answer is: 9"
"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to find the width. Since we know the area and the length, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length * Width.

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we need to convert the length to feet because the area is in square feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so the length in feet is 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Now we can use the formula to find the width: 360 = 9 * Width. To find the width, we divide both sides by 9: Width = 360 / 9 = 40 feet.

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width). Plugging in the values, we get Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40) = 2 * 49 = 98 feet.

The final answer is: 98"
"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister has.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, let's find the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters:
Difference = Total beads Margareth has - Total beads Elizabeth has
= 140 - 60
= 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the final temperature of the house, we need to calculate the temperature increase due to the oven and the temperature decrease due to the open window.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour, and Marcus bakes for 3 hours. So, the total temperature increase is 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the open window. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are there in 30 minutes. 30 minutes / 10 minutes = 3 intervals. So, the total temperature decrease is 2 degrees/interval * 3 intervals = 6 degrees.

Now, let's subtract the temperature decrease from the temperature increase: 15 degrees (increase) - 6 degrees (decrease) = 9 degrees.

The initial temperature of the house was 40 degrees. So, the final temperature is 40 degrees + 9 degrees = 49 degrees.

The final answer is: 49"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took James to complete each segment of the triathlon. 

Let's start with the swim. Since James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, we need to find 10% of Jon's swim time and subtract it from Jon's swim time. 

10% of 40 minutes is 0.1 x 40 = 4 minutes. So, James' swim time is 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

Next, we know that James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. Jon's bike time is 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes. So, James' bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, we know that Jon won by 10 minutes. This means that the difference between Jon's total time and James' total time is 10 minutes. We can set up an equation to represent this:

Jon's total time - James' total time = 10 minutes

We know Jon's total time is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes. We also know James' swim time is 36 minutes and his bike time is 85 minutes. Let's call James' run time 'x'. Then, James' total time is 36 + 85 + x.

So, the equation becomes:
170 - (36 + 85 + x) = 10

Simplifying the equation, we get:
170 - 121 - x = 10
49 - x = 10
x = 39

Therefore, it took James 39 minutes to complete the run. 

The final answer is: 39"
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then calculate one-fourth of that length.

Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

First, let's find out how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes. Since the horse runs at 32MPH, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

30 minutes is 0.5 hours (since 1 hour = 60 minutes).

Now, we can calculate the distance traveled by the horse:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32MPH * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, the total hay consumed is:
Total hay = Distance * (1/2 bail/mile)
Total hay = 16 miles * (1/2 bail/mile)
Total hay = 8 bails

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of the hay is:
Total cost = Total hay * Cost per bail
Total cost = 8 bails * $3/bail
Total cost = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, so the total amount of money he has is:
Total money = 6 * $5
Total money = $30

Now, we can find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay:
Change = Total money - Total cost
Change = $30 - $24
Change = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many trays Rozanne can put out, we first need to determine the total number of eggs she has. 

Rozanne uses 4 dozen eggs from cases. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs would be 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. 

In addition to the eggs from the cases, she also uses 2 loose eggs. So, the total number of eggs is 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs, so the total number of glasses she can make is 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, the total number of trays she can put out is 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many points Joey is winning by, we need to calculate the difference between his final score and Marcy's final score.

Next, let's calculate Marcy's final score: 
Marcy's initial score: 225 points
Marcy's score after her turn: 225 + 10 = 235 points

Now, let's find the difference between their final scores: 
Difference = Joey's final score - Marcy's final score
Difference = 240 - 235
Difference = 5

So, Joey is winning by 5 points.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the salesman's profit, we first need to calculate the total revenue from the flash sale and the sales to the department store.

The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each at the flash sale, so the total revenue from the flash sale is:
17 * $20 = $340

The salesman sold the rest of the sneakers (48 - 17 = 31) to the department store for $25 each, so the total revenue from the department store is:
31 * $25 = $775

The total revenue from both sales is:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The cost of the case of 48 sneakers is $576. To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the total revenue:
$1115 - $576 = $539

The final answer is: $539"

6 packets * 8 crayons/packet = 48 crayons

Next, let's calculate the total number of crayons in the four packets with sixteen pieces each:
4 packets * 16 crayons/packet = 64 crayons

Now, let's add the total number of crayons from both types of packets:
48 crayons + 64 crayons = 112 crayons

The final answer is: 112"
"Let's break down the information given. 

If you buy a movie super ticket for $20 and get one popcorn with a soda for $1 extra, the total cost is $21. 

If you buy a movie ticket for $12 and buy one popcorn and a soda at regular price, the total cost is $12 + (popcorn price + soda price). 

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the total cost of the regular option is $21 - $2 = $19. 

Now, let's set up an equation for the regular option: 
12 + (popcorn price + 3) = 19

Subtract 12 from both sides: 
(popcorn price + 3) = 7

Subtract 3 from both sides: 
popcorn price = 4

The regular price of popcorn is $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as 'x'. Since the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, we can set up the equation:

20x = 900

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

x = 900 / 20
x = 45

So, the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost of filling one balloon is:

New cost = Original cost + Increase
New cost = 45 + 20
New cost = 65

Now, we need to find the total cost of filling 170 balloons at the new rate:

Total cost = New cost per balloon * Number of balloons
Total cost = 65 * 170
Total cost = 11,050

The final answer is: 11050"
"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 mph x 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 mph x 1 hour
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's find the total distance traveled:
Total Distance = 120 miles + 30 miles
Total Distance = 150 miles

The total time taken is the sum of the time taken at 60 mph and 30 mph:
Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour
Total Time = 3 hours

Finally, we can calculate the average speed:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average Speed = 50 mph

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the value of the sapphires and rubies Jenna has after the trade. 

Initially, Jenna has 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. This means she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left. 

The value of the sapphires she has left is 5 * $800 = $4000. 

The value of the rubies she got in the trade is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

"To find the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of apples they eat per day and then multiply it by 30.

Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. So together, they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples per day.

Now, we multiply the total number of apples they eat per day by 30 to find the total number of apples they eat in 30 days: 8 * 30 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the total number of beds.

The volume of one raised bed is calculated as length * width * height. 
Volume = 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:
Total Volume = 32 * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. To find the total number of bags needed, we divide the total volume by the volume of one bag:
Number of bags = Total Volume / Volume per bag = 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:
Total Cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag = 160 * 12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of cards, we first need to determine the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of red cards = 15
60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and add them together.

The farmer buys 2 boxes of sugar cubes, each weighing 1 pound, so the total weight of sugar cubes is 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

The farmer buys 4 bags of carrots, each weighing 12 pounds, so the total weight of carrots is 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

The farmer buys 42 bales of hay, each weighing 75 pounds, so the total weight of hay is 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

The farmer buys 20 sacks of oats, each weighing 65 pounds, so the total weight of oats is 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

The total weight of all the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds.

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight of the feed by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips needed.

3400 / 2250 = 1.511 (round up to the nearest whole number since we can't make a fraction of a trip)

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the total earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the earnings from aluminum cans. Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week, and each can is worth 2 cents. So, her weekly earnings from aluminum cans are 3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, her total earnings from aluminum cans in a month are 6 cents/week * 4 weeks = 24 cents.

Next, let's calculate the earnings from plastic bottles. Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week, and each bottle is worth 3 cents. So, her weekly earnings from plastic bottles are 5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week.

In a month, her total earnings from plastic bottles are 15 cents/week * 4 weeks = 60 cents.

Now, let's add the earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles to find the total earnings in a month: 24 cents (aluminum cans) + 60 cents (plastic bottles) = 84 cents.

"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we need to first determine how many plants Toni has. Since Frederick has 10 plants and Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, we can calculate Toni's plants as follows:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find out how many plants Shondra has. Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, so we subtract 7 from Toni's total:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has. Since she has six decks with 25 cards in each deck, we multiply the number of decks by the number of cards in each deck:

6 decks * 25 cards/deck = 150 basketball cards

Next, we need to find the total number of baseball cards Miss Maria has. Since she has five boxes with 40 cards in each box, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of cards in each box:

5 boxes * 40 cards/box = 200 baseball cards

Now, we add the total number of basketball cards and baseball cards to find the total number of cards Miss Maria has:

150 basketball cards + 200 baseball cards = 350 cards

However, Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so we subtract 50 from the total number of cards:

350 cards - 50 cards = 300 cards

Since Miss Maria gives the remaining cards to her students, and each student gets 10 cards, we divide the remaining cards by 10 to find the number of students:

300 cards / 10 cards/student = 30 students

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, which is x/2. He also gets two extra cookies for cleaning his room. So, the total number of cookies he gets is x/2 + 2.

We are given that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x/2 + 2 = 5.

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. First, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: x/2 = 5 - 2, which simplifies to x/2 = 3.

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: x = 3 * 2, which simplifies to x = 6.

"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert their individual lengths to feet and then add them together. 

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 6 inches to feet by dividing by 12. 

6 inches / 12 = 0.5 feet

Since there are two remoras, we multiply the length of one remora by 2.

0.5 feet * 2 = 1 foot

Now, we add the length of the remoras to the length of the shark.

10 feet (shark) + 1 foot (remoras) = 11 feet

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy, we divide the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of students at the grade level. We know that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, which means one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. Since 20 students do not have a desktop computer, we can set up the following equation:

1/4 * Total number of students = 20

To find the total number of students, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

Total number of students = 20 * 4
Total number of students = 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To find out how many days Jason has to break in the shoes, we need to multiply the number of days he has (21 days, since there are 7 days in a week and he has 3 weeks) by the number of days he walks per week (4 days). 

21 days * 4 days/week = 84 days

Now, we need to find out how many minutes he has to walk each day. To do this, we divide the total number of minutes (240 minutes) by the total number of days (84 days).

240 minutes / 84 days = 2.857 minutes/day

So, Jason has to spend approximately 2.86 minutes walking each day to break in the new shoes.

The final answer is: 2.86"
"To find out how many books each child got, we need to first determine the total number of books Sarah bought. Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can divide the total amount spent by the cost of each book.

Total amount spent = $300
Cost of each book = $15

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost of each book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by 4 to find out how many books each child got.

Number of books per child = Total number of books / 4
Number of books per child = 20 / 4
Number of books per child = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to first find the total number of kids allergic to at least one thing. 

We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find this. The formula is Total = A + B - Both, where A is the number of kids allergic to dairy, B is the number of kids allergic to peanuts, and Both is the number of kids allergic to both.

A = 9 (kids allergic to dairy)
B = 6 (kids allergic to peanuts)
Both = 3 (kids allergic to both)

Total allergic = A + B - Both = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12

Now, to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we subtract the total number of kids allergic from the total number of kids in the class.

Total kids in the class = 32
Kids not allergic = Total kids - Total allergic = 32 - 12 = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to calculate the total number of employees and add the number of tour guides.

First, let's find the total number of employees: 
There are 3 groups of 200 employees each, so the total number of employees is 3 * 200 = 600.

Next, we need to add the number of tour guides. Each group has 7 tour guides, and there are 3 groups, so the total number of tour guides is 3 * 7 = 21.

Now, we add the total number of employees and tour guides: 600 (employees) + 21 (tour guides) = 621.

The final answer is: 621"
"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than normal, so the new price is 1.2 * $1500 = $1800 per day. Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel, which is $10,000 + $5400 = $16,400.

The final answer is: $16,400"
"To find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to determine the number of tubes of blue and yellow paint he has.

Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint. Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, so Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint. Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so Jasper has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

To find the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we add the number of blue and yellow tubes: 2 (blue) + 9 (yellow) = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to determine the weight of the 2010 penny. 

Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight by multiplying the weight of the 1959 penny by 3/4.

Weight of 1959 penny = 48 grains
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48 grains
Weight of 2010 penny = 36 grains

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their individual weights.

Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny
Combined weight = 48 grains + 36 grains
Combined weight = 84 grains

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how much more they need to earn, we need to calculate the total amount they have already earned and subtract that from their goal.

Keegan earned $83 and Tasha earned $91, so together they earned $83 + $91 = $174.

Their goal is to raise $200, so we subtract the amount they have already earned from the goal: $200 - $174 = $26.

They need to earn $26 more to reach their goal.

The final answer is: $26"
"To find out how many songs Luri can add to his player, we need to first determine how many songs he currently has. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, Luri has 3 * 20 = 60 songs.

Now, we need to find out how many songs each can add to their player. Since each player can store up to 100 songs, Gabriel can add 100 - 20 = 80 songs, and Luri can add 100 - 60 = 40 songs.

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add than Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add: 80 - 40 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we first need to determine how many oranges he ate. Since Stetson ate 2/5 of the oranges and they picked 60 oranges, we can calculate the number of oranges he ate as follows:

Number of oranges eaten = (2/5) * 60
= (2 * 60) / 5
= 120 / 5
= 24

Since Stetson gave up $10 for each orange he ate, we can multiply the number of oranges eaten by the amount given up per orange:

Total amount given up = Number of oranges eaten * Amount given up per orange
= 24 * $10
= $240

The final answer is: $240"
"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we need to first calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes. 

The cost of her shoes is $80. 
3 times the cost of her shoes is 3 * $80 = $240.

Since her handbag cost $20 less than 3 times as much as her shoes, we need to subtract $20 from $240.

$240 - $20 = $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"To find out how many hours James runs a week, we need to first calculate the total miles he runs in a week. Since he runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week, we multiply the miles per day by the number of days:

12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Next, we need to find out how many hours he runs in a week. We know he runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. To find the total hours, we divide the total miles by the speed:

60 miles/week Ã· 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week

So, James runs 6 hours a week.

"To determine the total amount of oats needed, we need to calculate the daily consumption of oats by Uncle Ben's horses and then multiply it by the number of days.

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and there are two meals per day. So, the daily consumption per horse is 5 pounds/meal * 2 meals = 10 pounds/day.

Since Uncle Ben has four horses, the total daily consumption is 10 pounds/day * 4 horses = 40 pounds/day.

For five days, the total consumption would be 40 pounds/day * 5 days = 200 pounds.

Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats, so the number of bags needed is 200 pounds / 50 pounds/bag = 4 bags.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the number of girl Pomeranians, we first need to find the total number of Pomeranians. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can calculate this as follows:

Total puppies = 27
Pomeranians = (2/3) * Total puppies
Pomeranians = (2/3) * 27
Pomeranians = 18

Now, we need to find the number of girl Pomeranians. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can calculate this as follows:

Girl Pomeranians = (1/3) * Pomeranians
Girl Pomeranians = (1/3) * 18
Girl Pomeranians = 6

The final answer is: 6"

"To find out how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we need to calculate the remaining amount first. 

The toy car costs $12, and the child already has $4. So, the remaining amount is $12 - $4 = $8.

The child promises to save $2 daily from his allowance. To find out how many days it will take to save $8, we can divide the remaining amount by the daily savings.

$8 / $2 = 4

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money.

"To find out how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we need to calculate the total capacity of the trays and subtract the number of eggs he has.

Each tray can hold 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays. So, the total capacity of the trays is 24 * 2 = 48 eggs.

Jaime has 64 eggs, but the trays can only hold 48 eggs. To find out how many eggs won't fit, we subtract the capacity from the total number of eggs: 64 - 48 = 16.

So, Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the tray.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total amount Sally spent, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza first. Since it costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, we multiply the cost of the small pizza by 3.

Cost of small pizza: $8
Cost of family-size pizza: $8 * 3 = $24

Now, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount spent.

Total amount spent: $8 + $24 = $32

"To find the cost per individual razor after the discount, we need to first calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon.

Since the razors are buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors. The sale price of 1 pack is $4.00, and she has a $2.00 coupon. 

The total cost of 1 pack of razors after the coupon is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, the cost per individual razor is $2.00 / 4 = $0.50.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents.

However, since Heather buys 2 packs, we need to calculate the total cost of 2 packs and then divide by 8 (2 packs * 4 razors per pack).

The total cost of 2 packs after the coupon is 2 * ($4.00 - $2.00) = $4.00.

The cost per individual razor is $4.00 / 8 = $0.50.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each level and add them up.

The 4 girls on the bottom are 64"" tall each. 
4 * 64"" = 256""

The 3 girls on top of the 4 are also 64"" tall each. 
3 * 64"" = 192""

The 2 girls on top of the 3 are also 64"" tall each. 
2 * 64"" = 128""

The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, we add up the heights of all the levels:
256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 636""

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
636"" / 12 = 53 feet

The final answer is: 53"
"To find the total number of minutes Charisma walked, we need to calculate the total number of 5-minute breaks she took in a day and then multiply it by the number of days she worked.

Charisma works 8 hours a day, and she takes a 5-minute break every hour. So, the total number of 5-minute breaks in a day is 8 hours * 1 break per hour = 8 breaks per day.

Since each break is 5 minutes long, the total number of minutes she walked in a day is 8 breaks * 5 minutes per break = 40 minutes per day.

Charisma worked for 5 days, so the total number of minutes she walked is 40 minutes per day * 5 days = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine Brett's age in four years. Since Brett is 14 years old now, in four years, he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.

According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is 14 years old now, three times his current age is 3 * 14 = 42 years old.

Since Angela will be 42 years old in four years, we need to subtract 4 from 42 to find her current age. Angela's current age is 42 - 4 = 38 years old.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides separately, and then add them together.

The cost of the morning rides is the cost per ride multiplied by the number of rides. Since Paul drives twice a day for 14 days, he drives a total of 2 * 14 = 28 rides in the morning. The cost per ride is $6, so the total cost of the morning rides is 28 * $6 = $168.

The cost of the afternoon rides is also the cost per ride multiplied by the number of rides. Since Paul drives twice a day for 14 days, he drives a total of 2 * 14 = 28 rides in the afternoon. The cost per ride is $2, so the total cost of the afternoon rides is 28 * $2 = $56.

To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we add the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides: $168 + $56 = $224.

The final answer is: $224"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of oranges both Ashley and Brianne brought and then divide that by the number of oranges needed for one pie.

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so she brought 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she brought 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

The total number of oranges they have is 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

One Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, so the number of pies they can make is 120 / 3 = 40.

"Let's break down the costs for each venue. 

For the first venue, the cost is a flat fee of $200, plus $5 per guest. If there are x guests, the total cost for the first venue is $200 + $5x.

For the second venue, the cost is $25 per guest. If there are x guests, the total cost for the second venue is $25x.

Since we want the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up the equation:

$200 + $5x = $25x

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting $5x from both sides:

$200 = $20x

Now, we can divide both sides by $20 to solve for x:

x = $200 / $20
x = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Let's denote the number of insects David found as D, the number of insects Bodhi found as B, and the number of insects Lily found as L. 

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so we can write an equation: L = D + 7.

We also know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can write another equation: D = B/2.

We are also given that together they collected 43 insects, so the sum of the insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43: L + D + B = 43.

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the third equation: (D + 7) + D + B = 43.

Combine like terms: 2D + B + 7 = 43.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2D + B = 36.

Now, substitute the second equation into the new equation: 2(D) + B = 36, and D = B/2. This gives us 2(B/2) + B = 36.

Simplify the equation: B + B = 36.

Combine like terms: 2B = 36.

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18.

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: D = B/2 = 18/2 = 9.

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found: L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16.

"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to calculate the yards used by Mariah and her grandma separately and then add them together.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein. To find 1/4 of 364, we multiply 364 by 1/4 (which is the same as dividing by 4).

364 yards / 4 = 91 yards

So, Mariah used 91 yards of yarn.

Mariah's grandma used 1/2 of a skein, which is the same as 2/4. To find 2/4 of 364, we multiply 364 by 2 and then divide by 4.

364 * 2 = 728
728 / 4 = 182 yards

So, Mariah's grandma used 182 yards of yarn.

Now, we add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma together.

91 yards (Mariah) + 182 yards (grandma) = 273 yards

The final answer is: 273"
"To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the total number of gifts her friends want and then add the 10 random gifts she bought.

First, let's calculate the total number of gifts her friends want. 2 friends want 5 gifts each, so that's 2 x 5 = 10 gifts. The other 3 friends want 2 gifts each, so that's 3 x 2 = 6 gifts. 

Now, let's add the number of gifts the 2 friends want and the number of gifts the other 3 friends want: 10 + 6 = 16 gifts.

Finally, we add the 10 random gifts Cherrie bought: 16 + 10 = 26.

"Let's break down the information given. Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total. She bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, 1 pack of grape gum for $2, and 1 pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum.

Since the green apple gum costs half as much as the grape gum, and the grape gum costs $2, the green apple gum costs $2 / 2 = $1.

The total cost of all the gum is $7. We know the cost of 3 packs of gum: 2 packs of strawberry gum (unknown cost), 1 pack of grape gum ($2), and 1 pack of green apple gum ($1). 

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as 'x'. The total cost equation is: 2x + 2 + 1 = 7.

Combine like terms: 2x + 3 = 7.

Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = 4.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 2.

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2."
"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives him the most sticks per dollar spent. 

Let's calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood:

For a 2 x 4, Frederick can get 200 sticks for $4. 
Cost per stick = $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick

For a 2 x 8, Frederick can get 400 sticks for $6.
Cost per stick = $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick

Since the 2 x 8 costs less per stick, Frederick should buy the 2 x 8 wood to maximize the number of popsicle sticks.

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with his $24:

Number of 2 x 8 pieces = $24 / $6 = 4

Since each 2 x 8 piece gives 400 sticks, the total number of sticks Frederick can make is:

Total sticks = 4 * 400 = 1600

The final answer is: 1600"
"To find the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs, we first need to determine the total number of snowshoes required. Since each dog has 4 legs and Mario has 6 dogs, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24.

Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, and each pair covers 4 legs, we need to divide the total number of legs by 4 to get the total number of pairs of snowshoes required. However, since each dog needs a pair, we simply need to know how many dogs there are, which is 6.

The total number of snowshoes required is 6 pairs.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of pairs of snowshoes by the cost per pair. The cost per pair is $12.00.

Total cost = 6 * $12.00 = $72.00

The final answer is: $72.00"
"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week and then subtract the cost of the weekly pass.

Janet takes two bus trips per day, five days a week. So, the total number of bus trips per week is 2 * 5 = 10.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost of her bus trips for a week is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

The weekly bus pass costs $20. To find out how much Janet would save, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of her bus trips: $22 - $20 = $2.

Therefore, Janet would save $2 by buying a weekly bus pass.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.
3. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.
4. The zoo has 20 sheep, so the total number of sheep is 10 (from the farm) + 20 (from the zoo) = 30 sheep.
5. The total number of animals is the sum of the cows and sheep from both the farm and the zoo: 30 (farm cows) + 60 (zoo cows) + 10 (farm sheep) + 20 (zoo sheep) = 120.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many items Sophia bought. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of items Sophia bought, we can represent the number of items Sophia bought as 'x'. 

Rose bought 4 times the number of items Sophia bought, so the number of items Rose bought is 4x. We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, so the total number of items Rose bought is 12 + 4 = 16. 

Since Rose bought 4 times the number of items Sophia bought, we can set up the equation 4x = 16. To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4, which gives us x = 4.

Now that we know Sophia bought 4 items, we can find the total number of items Sophia bought by adding the number of onions and potatoes she bought. However, we don't know the exact number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. We only know that the total number of items she bought is 4.

To find the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we need to find the ratio of onions to potatoes that Rose bought. Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, so the ratio of onions to potatoes is 12:4 or 3:1. 

Since Sophia bought 4 items, and the ratio of onions to potatoes is 3:1, we can assume that Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. 

The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 3 + 1 = 4.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of days Andy has to reach his goal and then determine the daily calorie deficit required.

First, let's calculate the number of days Andy has to reach his goal. His birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. 

December has 31 days, January has 31 days, February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year), March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and July has 19 days. 

Total days = 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 211 days

Now, let's calculate the total calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 pounds. Since he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, he needs to burn 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories by the number of days: 105,000 / 211 days = approximately 497 calories per day.

"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate his total earnings for the week and then subtract the amount he spent.

Since Gerald works for a week, which has 7 days, and he earns $30 per day, we can calculate his total earnings as follows:

Total earnings = Daily earnings * Number of days
Total earnings = $30 * 7
Total earnings = $210

Now, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings to find out how much he has left:

Amount left = Total earnings - Amount spent
Amount left = $210 - $100
Amount left = $110

"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total distance she will run. Since each lap is 0.25 km and she needs to run 8 laps, we multiply the number of laps by the distance per lap.

Distance = Number of laps * Distance per lap
Distance = 8 * 0.25 km
Distance = 2 km

Since Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs, we multiply the total distance by the amount of water needed per kilometer.

Total water needed = Distance * Water per kilometer
Total water needed = 2 km * 60 ml/km
Total water needed = 120 ml

"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's denote the cost of the lot as 'x'. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write the equation: x + 3x = 120,000.

Combining like terms, we get 4x = 120,000.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 120,000 / 4 = 30,000.

Since the cost of the house is 3x, we multiply x by 3: 3 * 30,000 = 90,000.

The house cost $90,000.

The final answer is: $90,000"
"To find the profit, we first need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The total cost is the cost of the canvas bags, which is 8 packs * 5 bags per pack * $4 per bag = 8 * 5 * 4 = $160.

The total revenue is the selling price of the bags, which is 8 bags * $8 per bag = 8 * 8 = $64.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $64 - $160 = -$96. However, since profit cannot be negative, it seems there's an error in the problem. Assuming the problem is asking for the profit per bag, we can calculate it as ($8 - $4) per bag, which is $4 per bag. The total profit per bag is $4 * 8 bags = $32.

The final answer is: $32"
"To find the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to calculate the total time of the fight and multiply it by the average number of punches he throws per minute.

The fight lasts for 5 rounds of 3 minutes each, so the total time is 5 * 3 = 15 minutes.

Since Joe throws 25 punches per minute, the total number of punches he threw is 15 * 25 = 375.

The final answer is: 375"
"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to first determine how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can calculate Josh's cookies as follows:

Josh's cookies = Suzanne's cookies / 4
Josh's cookies = 36 / 4
Josh's cookies = 9

Now that we know Josh made 9 cookies, we can find out how many Kelsie made. Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, so we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

The final answer is: 18"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Ali has. 

Ali has four $10 bills, which is 4 * $10 = $40. 
He also has six $20 bills, which is 6 * $20 = $120. 
The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives his sister half of the total money, which is $160 / 2 = $80. 
So, Ali is left with $160 - $80 = $80.

Now, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. 
3/5 of $80 is (3/5) * $80 = $48.

To find the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner, we subtract the amount he spent from the remaining amount: 
$80 - $48 = $32.

The final answer is: $32"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Rob to shingle a house in minutes. Since Rob takes 2 hours, we need to convert this to minutes. 

1 hour = 60 minutes
2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. Let's first find out what double the time it takes Rob is. 

Double the time it takes Rob = 2 * 120 = 240 minutes

Now, we add 40 minutes to this to find out how long it takes Royce. 

Time it takes Royce = 240 + 40 = 280 minutes

- 1 skein for a pair of mittens
- 2 skeins for a pair of socks

Total skeins per child: 2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2 = 19

Since there are 3 children, we multiply the total skeins per child by 3:
19 * 3 = 57

Martha will need 57 skeins of wool in total.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

On Monday, Chris completes 12 problems. 
So, the remaining problems after Monday are 100 - 12 = 88.

On Tuesday, Chris completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems. 
So, the remaining problems after Tuesday are 88 - 36 = 52.

On Wednesday, Chris completes one-quarter of the remaining math problems, which is 52 / 4 = 13 problems. 
So, the remaining problems after Wednesday are 52 - 13 = 39.

Therefore, Chris has 39 math problems left to complete on Thursday.

"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour, we need to calculate the individual rates of each person and then add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add the individual rates together to find the total number of quarts of strawberries that they can pick per hour: 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29.

"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakers had left, we need to subtract the number of loaves sold and returned from the total number of loaves baked.

First, let's calculate the total number of loaves sold: 
93 (morning) + 39 (afternoon) = 132 loaves sold

Now, let's add the number of loaves returned by the grocery store: 
132 (sold) + 6 (returned) = 138 loaves

Now, let's subtract the total number of loaves sold and returned from the initial number of loaves baked: 
200 (initial) - 138 (sold and returned) = 62 loaves

The bakers had 62 loaves of bread left.

"To find the number of rows of red tulips, we divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row: 36 red tulips / 6 tulips per row = 6 rows of red tulips.

To find the number of rows of blue tulips, we divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row: 24 blue tulips / 8 tulips per row = 3 rows of blue tulips.

Since the rows of red and blue tulips are separate, we add the number of rows of each color to find the total number of rows: 6 rows of red tulips + 3 rows of blue tulips = 9 rows of flowers.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we first need to determine how many cups of raisins she has available for the oatmeal cookies. 

Since she wants to divide the raisins equally among the oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix, we can divide the total number of cups of raisins by 3. 

Total raisins = 27 cups
Raisins for oatmeal cookies = Total raisins / 3
Raisins for oatmeal cookies = 27 / 3
Raisins for oatmeal cookies = 9 cups

Now, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make with 9 cups of raisins. Each batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. 

Number of batches = Raisins for oatmeal cookies / Raisins per batch
Number of batches = 9 / (3/4)
To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal.
Number of batches = 9 * (4/3)
Number of batches = 12

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we first need to calculate her daily and weekly electric consumption before and after adding the new device.

Before adding the new device, Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, her daily consumption is 12 * 24 = 288 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day.

After adding the new device, her daily consumption will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour. So, her daily consumption will be 14 * 24 = 336 kWh per day.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7. 

Before adding the new device, Ada's weekly consumption is 288 * 7 = 2016 kWh.
After adding the new device, her weekly consumption is 336 * 7 = 2352 kWh.

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kWh. So, the weekly cost before adding the new device is 2016 * $1.50 = $3024.
The weekly cost after adding the new device is 2352 * $1.50 = $3528.

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $3528 - $3024 = $504.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how long it would take one person to paint a whole house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, it would take them 10 days to paint a whole house (since it would take twice as long to paint the entire house).

Now, let's calculate the total hours it would take one person to paint a whole house. There are 24 hours in a day, so 10 days would be 10 x 24 = 240 hours.

Since we know it would take one person 240 hours to paint a whole house, we can now calculate how long it would take 5 people to paint a whole house. If one person takes 240 hours, 5 people would take 240 / 5 = 48 hours.

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.
4. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have:

Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, so she has 20 + 22 = 42 pieces of furniture.
Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs, so she has 64 + 66 = 130 pieces of furniture.
The total number of sofas and chairs they have is 42 + 130 = 172.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Tom spent on the headphone set. We can do this by subtracting the cost of the CD from the total amount he paid.

Total amount paid = $48
Cost of CD = $4
Cost of headphone set = Total amount paid - Cost of CD
= $48 - $4
= $44

Now that we know the cost of the headphone set, we can find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with that amount.

Cost of one CD = $4
Number of CDs Tom could have bought with the cost of the headphone set = Cost of headphone set / Cost of one CD
= $44 / $4
= 11

So, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to consider the weeks where he spent 4 hours, 5 hours, and 6 hours. 

First, let's find the total hours spent in the weeks where he spent 4 hours each. There are 6 weeks where he spent 4 hours, so the total hours spent in these weeks is 6 * 4 = 24 hours.

Next, let's find the total hours spent in the weeks where he spent 5 hours each. There are 2 weeks where he spent 5 hours, so the total hours spent in these weeks is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

Finally, let's find the total hours spent in the week where he spent 6 hours. There is 1 week where he spent 6 hours, so the total hours spent in this week is 1 * 6 = 6 hours.

Now, let's add up the total hours spent in all the weeks: 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 hours.

The total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is 40."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is 48 - 8 = 40.

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (which is 8) get into the bus. So, 5 * 8 = 40 people get in. Now, the total number of people on the bus is 40 (who were already there) + 40 (who got in) = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is 80 - 21 = 59.

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. Since 21 got off, 3 times fewer would be 21 / 3 = 7. So, 7 people get in. Now, the total number of people on the bus is 59 (who were already there) + 7 (who got in) = 66.

The final number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is 66."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.
2. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. 
   Jame's age in 8 years will be 22 + 8 = 30 years.
   Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60 years.
   So, Jame's cousin's age in 8 years will be 60 - 5 = 55 years.
3. Since Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, his current age is 55 - 8 = 47 years.

Now, let's find the difference in their current ages: 47 (cousin's age) - 22 (Jame's age) = 25 years.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we first need to determine the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

The total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. 

Since Errol bought the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for $2,400, the total cost of the 2 monitors is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the monitors by 2: $600 / 2 = $300.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many shells the boys brought in total. Since there are 10 boys (half of 20 kids) and each brought 60 shells, the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

Now, we know that the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + 4 * 60 shells.

First, we calculate 4 times the number of shells brought by the boys: 4 * 60 = 240.

Then, we add this to the number of shells brought by the boys: 600 + 240 = 840.

Since there are 10 girls (half of 20 kids), we need to find out how many shells each girl brought. To do this, we divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by the number of girls: 840 / 10 = 84.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, let's assume the number of candies George had before eating 5 candies is x. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, the number of candies Nick had is 2x.

George ate 5 candies, so the number of candies George has left is x - 5. We are given that George has 3 candies left, so we can set up the equation:

x - 5 = 3

To solve for x, we add 5 to both sides of the equation:

x = 3 + 5
x = 8

Now that we know George had 8 candies initially, we can find the number of candies Nick had, which is 2x:

Nick's candies = 2x
= 2(8)
= 16

So, Nick has 16 candies.

Total vlogs made = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Since Emma's target is 72 vlogs, we subtract the total vlogs made from the target to find out how many more vlogs she needs to make.

Vlogs needed = 72 - 54 = 18

So, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete her target of 72 vlogs per month.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much Elvis needs to save in the first half of the month. 

Let's assume the number of days in the first half of the month is x. Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, the number of days in the second half is also x.

The total number of days in the month is 30 (April has 30 days). So, the total number of days in the first half is 15 (half of 30).

Now, let's denote the amount Elvis saves in the first half as y. Then, the amount he saves in the second half is 2y.

The total amount Elvis needs to save in the month is $1125. So, we can set up the equation:

y + 2y = 1125

Combine like terms:

3y = 1125

Divide both sides by 3:

y = 375

Now that we know Elvis saves $375 in the first half, we can find out how much he needs to save in the second half. Since he saves twice as much in the second half, the amount he saves in the second half is 2y = 2 * 375 = 750.

So, Elvis needs to save $750 in the second half of the month.

The cost of 1 calculator at $12 is $12.
The cost of 1 geometry set at $10 is $10.

The total cost of all the items before the discount is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

To apply the 10% discount, we need to find 10% of $30, which is 0.10 x $30 = $3.

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as in cold water. Since it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile in cold water, twice that time is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. Adding 2 minutes to that gives us 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water. 

In cold water, it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile, so for 3 miles it would be 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.

In warm water, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile, so for 3 miles it would be 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and cold water is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find out how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly earnings and then divide the target savings by his weekly earnings.

First, let's calculate John's daily earnings: 
$2 per hour * 5 hours per day = $10 per day

Next, let's calculate John's weekly earnings: 
$10 per day * 4 days per week = $40 per week

Now, let's divide the target savings by his weekly earnings to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80:
$80 / $40 per week = 2 weeks

"To find the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub, we need to multiply the cost of the foot-long fish sub by 3. 

Cost of the foot-long fish sub: $40
Cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub: $40 * 3 = $120

Now, we need to find the total cost of both subs. 

Total cost = Cost of the foot-long fish sub + Cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub
Total cost = $40 + $120
Total cost = $160

The final answer is: $160"
"To find the total number of holes in the bag, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the number of holes in the buttons with four holes.

There are 7 buttons with two holes, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 * 2 = 14.

The rest of the buttons have four holes, and since there are 21 buttons in total, the number of buttons with four holes is 21 - 7 = 14.

The total number of holes in the buttons with four holes is 14 * 4 = 56.

Now, we add the total number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the buttons with four holes: 14 + 56 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to start with Timothy's locker size and work our way down.

Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches. 
Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so Zack's locker is 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches.
Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, so Peter's locker is 12 / 4 = 3 cubic inches.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many cups of coffee Octavia drinks. Since she drinks half the daily recommended amount, and assuming the daily recommended amount is 8 cups (a common recommendation), Octavia drinks 8 / 2 = 4 cups of coffee.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, so Juan drinks 10 * 4 = 40 cups of coffee.

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to 4 cups. To find out how many cups he needs to reduce, we subtract the recommended amount from his current intake: 40 - 4 = 36 cups.

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total number of rodents, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the total number of hamsters: 
There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, so the total number of hamsters is 3 * 10 = 30.

Next, let's find the total number of guinea pigs: 
There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so the total number of guinea pigs is 3 * 5 = 15.

Now, let's add the total number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents: 
Total rodents = Total hamsters + Total guinea pigs = 30 + 15 = 45.

"To find the average weight of the three friends, we need to first find their individual weights. 

Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds. 
Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so Susan's weight is 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. 
Bob's weight is twice as much as Susan's, so Bob's weight is 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we need to find the average weight of the three friends. To do this, we add their weights and divide by 3. 
Average weight = (Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight) / 3 
Average weight = (150 + 130 + 260) / 3 
Average weight = 540 / 3 
Average weight = 180

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total angle the sun will be from the ground after 10 hours. 

The initial angle of the sun from the ground is 32 degrees (the angle of the pyramid). The sun is moving 5 degrees per hour upward. 

After 10 hours, the sun will have moved 10 * 5 = 50 degrees upward.

So, the total angle from the ground to the sun will be the initial angle of the pyramid (32 degrees) plus the angle the sun has moved upward (50 degrees).

Total angle = 32 + 50 = 82 degrees.

The final answer is: 82"
"To find out how many packs of candles James needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of candles required. Since James has two sons, one 12 years old and the other 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Typically, birthday candles are used to match the age of the person, so James will need 12 candles for the older son and 8 candles for the younger son. 

In total, James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total number of candles needed by the number of candles per pack: 20 / 5 = 4.

Since James needs 4 packs of candles, and each pack costs $3, the total amount James spends on candles is 4 * 3 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she read in the first week and then convert that to pages. 

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Given that Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she read in the first week by first finding out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 105 minutes. 

To do this, we divide 105 by 1.5, which equals 70. So, Judy read 70 * 2 = 140 pages in the first week.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we add the pages she read in the first week to the pages she read in the second week: 140 + 100 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which is 12 / 3 = 4 sandwiches.

Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which is 12 / 4 = 3 sandwiches.

In total, they ate 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

Now, we subtract the number of sandwiches they ate from the total number of sandwiches: 12 - 7 = 5.

So, there are 5 sandwiches left.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote Shiloh's nephew's current age as 'x'. In 7 years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old. At that time, his nephew will be x + 7 years old.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This can be expressed as:

51 = 3(x + 7)

To solve for 'x', we need to expand the equation:

51 = 3x + 21

Now, we'll subtract 21 from both sides of the equation:

30 = 3x

Next, we'll divide both sides by 3 to isolate 'x':

x = 10

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

x = 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. The tooth fairy left $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. Since there are two teeth, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.
4. Now, let's add up the total amount: $5.00 (first tooth) + $3.00 (next three teeth) + $1.00 (last two teeth) = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that Richie scored 80 goals. We also know that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark and 45 more goals than Anna.

Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as M and the number of goals scored by Anna as A. We can set up two equations based on the given information:

1. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark: R = M + 20
2. Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna: R = A + 45

We are given that Richie scored 80 goals, so we can substitute R = 80 into both equations:

1. 80 = M + 20
2. 80 = A + 45

Now, let's solve for M and A:

1. Subtract 20 from both sides of the first equation: M = 80 - 20
   M = 60

2. Subtract 45 from both sides of the second equation: A = 80 - 45
   A = 35

Now that we know the number of goals scored by Mark (M = 60) and Anna (A = 35), we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers by adding their individual scores:

Total goals = R + M + A
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how much more money Mitchell made than Liam, we need to first calculate the total amount of money each of them made. 

Liam made $63 in total. 

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece, so we multiply the number of lemonades by the price per lemonade: 21 * 4 = 84. 

Now, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings to find the difference: 84 - 63 = 21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Peter spent on wooden action figures and the total amount he spent on plastic action figures, then determine how many of each type he can buy.

First, let's calculate the amount spent on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. Peter spent $5 each day for 4 days, so the total amount spent on wooden action figures is 5 * 4 = $20.

Since Peter has $70 and spent $20 on wooden action figures, he has $70 - $20 = $50 left. He will spend this remaining amount on plastic action figures from Thursday through Saturday.

Peter will spend $2 each day for 4 days on plastic action figures, so the total amount spent on plastic action figures is 2 * 4 = $8.

Now, let's calculate the total number of wooden action figures Peter bought: 20 / 5 = 4.

Next, let's calculate the total number of plastic action figures Peter bought: 8 / 2 = 4.

To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we add the number of wooden and plastic action figures: 4 + 4 = 8.

"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The total number of roses ordered per week is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is 65 * 4 = 260 roses.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is 40 * 4 = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month: 260 - 160 = 100 roses.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how much money will be remaining in Katina's account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount of money she will have removed from her account and subtract that from the initial amount.

There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are 2 x 12 = 24 months.

Katina removes $100 from her account every month, so in 24 months, she will remove 24 x $100 = $2400.

Now, let's subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount: $3000 - $2400 = $600.

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her account.

The final answer is: $600"
"To calculate the net profit, we need to find the total revenue and total cost.

The total revenue is the number of sandwiches sold multiplied by the price per sandwich. 
10 sandwiches * $7.00 per sandwich = $70.00

The total cost consists of the cost of bread and the cost of cheese and condiments. 
The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. 
So, the cost of bread per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 sandwiches = $0.30 per sandwich.
The cost of cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches is $30.00, so the cost per sandwich is $30.00 / 10 sandwiches = $3.00 per sandwich.
The total cost per sandwich is $0.30 (bread) + $3.00 (cheese and condiments) = $3.30 per sandwich.
The total cost for 10 sandwiches is $3.30 per sandwich * 10 sandwiches = $33.00.

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

The final answer is: $37.00"
"To find out how much money Kate can make, we need to determine the total number of muffin crayons she can make and then multiply that by the price of each muffin crayon.

First, let's find the total number of crayons Kate has. Since she has 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of crayons per box:

3 boxes * 64 crayons/box = 192 crayons

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one muffin crayon, we need to divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find out how many muffin crayons she can make:

192 crayons / 8 crayons/muffin = 24 muffin crayons

Now, we multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price of each muffin crayon to find out how much money Kate can make:

24 muffin crayons * $1.50/muffin crayon = $36

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the area of the bedroom and then calculate the costs for the new carpet, padding, and installation.

The area of the bedroom is the length multiplied by the width: 
Area = length * width
Area = 18 * 12
Area = 216 square feet

The cost of the new carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost for the carpet is:
Carpet cost = Area * $12
Carpet cost = 216 * $12
Carpet cost = $2592

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost for the padding is:
Padding cost = Area * $2
Padding cost = 216 * $2
Padding cost = $432

The cost to remove the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost for removal is:
Removal cost = Area * $4
Removal cost = 216 * $4
Removal cost = $864

The cost to install the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost for installation is:
Installation cost = Area * $34
Installation cost = 216 * $34
Installation cost = $7344

The total cost to replace the carpet is the sum of the carpet cost, padding cost, removal cost, and installation cost:
Total cost = Carpet cost + Padding cost + Removal cost + Installation cost
Total cost = $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344
Total cost = $11332

First, let's find 30% of $76,000. 
30% of $76,000 = 0.30 * $76,000 = $22,800

Now, let's subtract this amount from Herb's house price to find Juan's house price.
Juan's house price = Herb's house price - 30% of Herb's house price
= $76,000 - $22,800

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

To find the total number of utensils brought by the two, we need to add the number of cups and dishes from both Judy and her friend. 

Judy brought 12 + 24 = 36 utensils (cups + dishes). 
Her friend brought 40 + 44 = 84 utensils (cups + dishes).

The total number of utensils brought by the two is 36 + 84 = 120.

"To find the cost per pair of contacts, we first need to determine the total number of contacts in 2 boxes and the total cost of 2 boxes with the discount.

Since 90 contacts last Pete 45 days, we can find the number of contacts he uses per day: 90 contacts / 45 days = 2 contacts per day.

In 2 boxes, there are 2 * 90 = 180 contacts.

The original price of 2 boxes is 2 * $100 = $200. With a 10% discount, the discount amount is $200 * 0.10 = $20. The discounted price is $200 - $20 = $180.

Now, to find the cost per pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts: $180 / 180 contacts = $1 per contact.

Since a pair of contacts is 2 contacts, the cost per pair is $1 * 2 = $2.

"To find out how much water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories she burns during her activities. 

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from aerobics is 2 * 500 = 1000 calories.

She also spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from running is 1 * 600 = 600 calories.

The total calories burned is the sum of calories burned from aerobics and running, which is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units she burned. 

Total calories burned / 200 = 1600 / 200 = 8

Since she needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she needs to drink 8 * 100 = 800 ml of water.

"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G. 

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so B + R + G = 4500.

We also know that R = 0.99B (1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans) and G = 1.01B (1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans).

Substituting the expressions for R and G into the first equation, we get:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3.01B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3.01:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:

G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30

"To determine the total number of people attending, we need to calculate the number of people invited via email, the number of friends Alex's friends will bring, and the number of Alex's friends and their spouses attending.

First, let's calculate the number of people invited via email. Each of the 100 people invited will bring 2 friends, so the total number of people invited via email is 100 + (100 * 2) = 300.

Next, Alex calls 10 friends and 8 of them will be bringing their spouses, so the total number of Alex's friends and their spouses is 10 + 8 = 18.

Now, we add the number of people invited via email and the number of Alex's friends and their spouses to get the total number of people attending. 

Total number of people attending = 300 + 18 = 318

However, we also need to consider Alex herself, so we add 1 to the total number of people attending.

"To solve this problem, we can use exponential growth. The initial height of the beanstalk is 4 feet, and it doubles every day. We want to find the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to be taller than 20 feet.

Let's start by calculating the height of the beanstalk for each day:

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 4: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

As we can see, on the 4th day, the beanstalk will be taller than 20 feet. Therefore, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we first need to calculate how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein percentage in a cup of mushrooms by dividing the protein by the weight: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 or 3%.

Now, we know that John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we multiply the weight of mushrooms he eats by the protein percentage: 200 grams * 0.03 = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to find the weekly protein intake: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's break down the information given. If Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can represent his current age as 'x'. 

Five years ago, Jerry's age would be 'x - 5'. According to the problem, Jerry's current age is twice his age 5 years ago, so we can write the equation: x = 2(x - 5).

Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 2x - 10.

Subtracting '2x' from both sides of the equation, we get: -x = -10.

Dividing both sides by -1, we get: x = 10.

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years. 

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 10 + 3 = 13.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how many hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. 

The base price for two implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. 
For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost for the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500. 
However, since he's getting two implants, he'll need to pay for the crown on the second implant as well. Therefore, the total cost is $4500 + $500 = $5000. 

George has already put down a deposit of $600. So, the remaining amount he needs to pay is $5000 - $600 = $4400.

Since George makes $15 per hour at work, to find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $4400 / $15 = 293.33 hours.

The final answer is: 293.33"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as 'x'. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, which is 2x, and one angle is three times the smallest angle, which is 3x.

Since the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

One angle is twice the smallest angle: 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
One angle is three times the smallest angle: 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

First, let's convert the quarters to cents: 8 quarters * 25 cents/quarter = 200 cents.
Next, let's convert the dimes to cents: 6 dimes * 10 cents/dime = 60 cents.
Then, we already have the number of nickels in cents: 14 nickels * 5 cents/nickel = 70 cents.
Lastly, we have the number of pennies in cents: 15 pennies * 1 cent/penny = 15 cents.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has: 200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents.

Since each gumball costs a nickel (5 cents), we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball: 345 cents / 5 cents = 69.

The final answer is: 69"
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and then add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, and there are 5 dogs, so the total number of dog legs is 5 x 4 = 20.

Cats have 4 legs each, and there are 2 cats, so the total number of cat legs is 2 x 4 = 8.

Birds have 2 legs each, and there are 10 birds, so the total number of bird legs is 10 x 2 = 20.

Now, let's add the total number of legs for each type of pet: 20 (dog legs) + 8 (cat legs) + 20 (bird legs) = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the weight Jamaal uses after increasing the 8-pound weight by 50%, we first need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds. 

50% of 8 pounds is 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds. 

Now, we add this to the original weight: 8 pounds + 4 pounds = 12 pounds. 

However, Jamaal finds this weight too heavy, so he uses a weight two pounds lighter than this. 

The weight he now uses is 12 pounds - 2 pounds = 10 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of games Steve receives each year and then sum them up over the three years.

In the first year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift and 5 games as Christmas gifts, for a total of 10 games. He also buys 1 game per month for 12 months, which is 12 games. So, in total, he has 10 + 12 = 22 games in the first year.

In the second year, Steve gets 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, for a total of 10 games. He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, which is 24 games. So, in total, he has 10 + 24 = 34 games in the second year.

In the third year, Steve gets 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, for a total of 10 games. He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, which is 48 games. So, in total, he has 10 + 48 = 58 games in the third year.

"To find the rate at which the plane travels, we need to divide the distance it traveled by the time it took. 

Distance = 1200 miles
Time = 3 hours

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we need to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this rate.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Since the question asks for the additional hours, we need to subtract the initial time from the total time.

Additional hours = Total time - Initial time
Additional hours = 5 hours - 3 hours
Additional hours = 2 hours

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total amount of chocolates made by Marissa in an hour, we need to first find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in an hour. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how many pounds he makes in an hour, we divide 120 by 2. 

120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour for Ruiz.

Since Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz, we multiply 60 by 3/4.

60 * (3/4) = 45 pounds per hour for Marissa.

Now, we know that both Ruiz and Marissa work for 12 hours a day. To find the total amount of chocolates made by Ruiz in 12 hours, we multiply 60 pounds per hour by 12.

60 * 12 = 720 pounds for Ruiz.

To find the total amount of chocolates made by Marissa in 12 hours, we multiply 45 pounds per hour by 12.

45 * 12 = 540 pounds for Marissa.

Now, we add the total amount of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa to find the total amount of chocolates made together.

720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

"To find out how much money Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is $25 + $35 = $60.

Since there's a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount. To do this, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage (30% or 0.3). The discount amount is $60 * 0.3 = $18.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost of the items. $60 - $18 = $42.

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to calculate it separately. We can subtract the final cost from the initial amount of money Joe has. $50 - $42 = $8.

So, Joe will have $8 left after the purchase.

The final answer is: $8"
"To determine the amount of butter needed, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants Juan wants to make in a week. Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day, and there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 4 dozen by 7.

4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can convert 28 dozen to individual croissants by multiplying by 12.

28 dozen * 12 = 336 croissants

Now, we know it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find out how much butter is needed for 336 croissants, we first need to convert the number of croissants to dozens.

336 croissants / 12 = 28 dozen

Now, we can multiply the number of dozens by the amount of butter needed per dozen.

28 dozen * 1/4 pound/dozen = 28 * 0.25 = 7 pounds

"To find the cost of repaving Lewis' street, we need to multiply the cost per meter by the length of his street. 

Cost per meter: $194
Length of Lewis' street: 490 meters

Cost to repave Lewis' street = Cost per meter * Length of Lewis' street
Cost to repave Lewis' street = $194 * 490
Cost to repave Lewis' street = $95,060

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's, we need to calculate the cost of repaving Monica's street and then subtract it from the cost of repaving Lewis' street.

Cost to repave Monica's street = Cost per meter * Length of Monica's street
Cost to repave Monica's street = $194 * 150
Cost to repave Monica's street = $29,100

Now, let's find the difference in cost:
Difference in cost = Cost to repave Lewis' street - Cost to repave Monica's street

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of John's research. 

First, let's find the total number of months his research took. Since it took 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, it took 5 * 10 = 50 months.

The initial funding was $100,000 for the first 5 months. After that, the funding increased by 50% each month. 

To find the cost for the first 5 months, we simply use the initial funding: $100,000.

For the remaining 45 months, we need to calculate the increased funding. The first month after the initial 5 months would be 50% more than $100,000, which is $150,000. 

The funding for the next month would be 50% more than the previous month, which is $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000. 

We can see a pattern here, where the funding increases by 50% each month. This is a geometric progression with a first term of $150,000 and a common ratio of 1.5.

The formula for the sum of a geometric progression is S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = $150,000, r = 1.5, and n = 45 (since we're calculating the cost for 45 months after the initial 5 months).

Plugging in the values, we get S = $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / (1 - 1.5).

S = $150,000 * (1 - 4.304332) / (-0.5)
S = $150,000 * (-3.304332) / (-0.5)
S = $150,000 * 6.608664
S = $994,099.96

Now, we add the cost of the first 5 months to the cost of the remaining 45 months: $100,000 + $994,099.96 = $1,094,099.96

The final answer is: $1,094,100"
"To find the total amount of meat consumed, we need to calculate the amount of meat eaten by each player and then add them up.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.

The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so the total amount of meat eaten by the second player is 8 ounces.

The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces of meat.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not eat any meat.

Now, let's add up the amount of meat eaten by the first three players: 6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces.

"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to calculate the difference between his current height and the required height, and then divide that by his growth rate.

First, let's convert Adam's height from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

40 inches / 12 = 3.33 feet

Since Adam needs to be 4 feet tall to ride the roller coaster, we subtract his current height from the required height:

4 feet - 3.33 feet = 0.67 feet

Now, we need to convert this difference back to inches, since Adam's growth rate is given in inches per year:

0.67 feet * 12 inches/foot = 8 inches

Now, we can divide the difference in height by Adam's growth rate to find out how many years it will take for him to reach the required height:

The selling price of each car is $25,000. 
The profit from each car is the selling price minus the cost, which is $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

James got a 10% commission on the profits, which is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

So, James made $17,500."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright on the wave. To find the number of riders who can stay upright, we multiply 100 by 0.25 (which is 25% expressed as a decimal).

100 * 0.25 = 25

So, 25 riders can stay upright on the wave.

Next, we are told that 60% of these 25 riders are women. To find the number of women who can stay upright, we multiply 25 by 0.6 (which is 60% expressed as a decimal).

25 * 0.6 = 15

Since the remaining riders who can stay upright are men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright.

25 - 15 = 10

Therefore, 10 men can stay upright on the wave.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we first need to find the prices of the gold and silver jewels.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, and the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold, so we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now that we have the prices of all three jewels, we can find the total price by adding them together:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp and add them together.

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps, we add the number of each type of stamp together: 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the relative speed between Bob and Tom. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed to get the relative speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph
Relative speed = -15 mph

However, since we are dealing with a time problem, we need to consider the absolute value of the relative speed, which is the distance between them divided by the relative speed.

Relative speed = 15 mph (absolute value)

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many fish Darren caught first, and then add 3 to that number to find out how many fish Tommy caught.

We know that Naomi caught 17 fish. Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, so we subtract 6 from 17 to find out how many fish Darren caught:

17 (Naomi's fish) - 6 = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we add 3 to find out how many fish Tommy caught:

11 (Darren's fish) + 3 = 14

So, Tommy caught 14 fish.

The final answer is: 14"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many classes Manny can miss before the average cost per class exceeds $10. 

Let's assume Manny misses x classes. Since there are 10 total classes, he will attend 10 - x classes. 

The total cost of the classes he attends is $60. 

The average cost per class is the total cost divided by the number of classes attended. 

We want to find the maximum number of classes he can miss before the average cost per class exceeds $10. 

Let's set up the inequality:

(60 / (10 - x)) > 10

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (10 - x):

60 > 10(10 - x)

Expanding the right side:

60 > 100 - 10x

Subtracting 60 from both sides:

0 > 40 - 10x

Adding 10x to both sides:

10x > 40

Dividing both sides by 10:

x < 4

Since x represents the number of classes Manny can miss, we want to find the maximum number of classes he can miss, which is the largest integer less than 4.

x = 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To find the total weekly production, we first need to determine the daily production of Julie and Jewel, and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day.

The combined daily production of Julie and Jewel is 50 (Jewel's production) + 100 (Julie's production) = 150 customers per day.

To find the total weekly production, we multiply the daily production by 7: 150 * 7 = 1050.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Paisley ran 4 miles.
2. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.
3. Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so Lynn ran 20 - 3 = 17 miles.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we need to first find the cost of one apple and one orange. 

The cost of 4 apples is $5.20, so the cost of one apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30. 

The cost of 3 oranges is $3.30, so the cost of one orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Now, we can find the total cost of 5 apples: 5 apples * $1.30/apple = $6.50.

Next, we can find the total cost of 5 oranges: 5 oranges * $1.10/orange = $5.50.

Finally, we can find the total cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges by adding the cost of the apples and the cost of the oranges: $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we can multiply the volume by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot.

Time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

216"
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the features and the base price:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500.

"To find out how much Tim will make in a year, we need to calculate his new monthly salary and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise on his $20,000 monthly salary. 
5% of $20,000 is 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000. 
So, his new monthly salary will be $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000.

Next, let's calculate the bonus, which is half a month's salary. 
Half of $20,000 is $10,000. 

Now, let's add the bonus to his new monthly salary. 
$21,000 (new monthly salary) + $10,000 (bonus) = $31,000 (total monthly income).

To find out how much he will make in a year, we multiply his total monthly income by 12. 
$31,000 * 12 = $372,000.

The final answer is: $372,000"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them up.

"To find the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to calculate the total number of articles published by each website and then add them together.

The news website publishes 20 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. So, the total number of articles published by the news website in February is:

20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles

The sister company publishes 10 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. So, the total number of articles published by the sister company in February is:

10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles

Now, we add the total number of articles published by both websites:

560 articles (news website) + 280 articles (sister company) = 840 articles

"To find the age of Steve's son's wife, we need to determine the ages of Steve's son and his wife.

First, we know Steve's age is 60 years. His wife is 4 years older than him, so his wife's age is 60 + 4 = 64 years.

Their son is half as old as his mom, so his age is 64 / 2 = 32 years.

Now, we know Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so her age is 32 - 3 = 29 years.

"To find the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we first need to find the total amount of flour in one bag. Since the bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, we can find the total amount of flour in one bag by multiplying the number of portions by the weight of each portion.

Total flour in one bag = 8 portions * 2 kilograms/portion = 16 kilograms

Now, we need to find the total amount of flour in three bags. We can do this by multiplying the total amount of flour in one bag by 3.

Total flour in three bags = 16 kilograms/bag * 3 bags = 48 kilograms

"To find the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add them together.

Alisa biked at 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. To find the distance she biked, we multiply her speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 12 miles/hour x 4.5 hours
Distance = 54 miles

Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. To find the distance he biked, we multiply his speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 2.5 hours
Distance = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances biked by Alisa and Stanley to find the total distance:

Total Distance = Distance biked by Alisa + Distance biked by Stanley
Total Distance = 54 miles + 25 miles
Total Distance = 79 miles

The final answer is: 79"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay separately, and then add those times together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil. Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil, and he needs to dig 24 feet of soil. 

Time to dig through soil = Total soil depth / Rate of digging through soil
Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour
Time to dig through soil = 6 hours

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay. Bill can dig half as fast through clay as he can through soil, so his rate of digging through clay is 4 / 2 = 2 feet/hour. He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

Time to dig through clay = Total clay depth / Rate of digging through clay
Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour
Time to dig through clay = 4 hours

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay to get the total time.

Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours
Total time = 10 hours

"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost for each day and then subtract the two amounts.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got a $2 discount. So, the total cost for the first day is:

20 pomegranates * $20 = $400
Discount: $2
Total cost for the first day = $400 - $2 = $398

On the second day, the price per pomegranate is $30, and there's a 10% discount on the total cost. So, the total cost for the second day is:

20 pomegranates * $30 = $600
Discount: 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Total cost for the second day = $600 - $60 = $540

Now, let's find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days:

Difference = Total cost for the second day - Total cost for the first day
Difference = $540 - $398
Difference = $142

The final answer is: $142"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the total sales from green hats in the first month. Since the sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, let's denote the total sales from green hats as 'x'. This means the sales from red hats are x/2.

We know that the sales from red hats were $400, so we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 400

To find the value of 'x', we multiply both sides by 2:

x = 400 * 2
x = 800

So, the total sales from green hats in the first month were $800.

Now, let's find the total sales from both red and green hats in the first month:

Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
= 400 + 800
= 1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. To find the total sales in the second month, we multiply the total sales in the first month by 3/4:

Total sales in the second month = (3/4) * 1200
= 900

Now, let's find the total sales in two months:

Total sales in two months = Total sales in the first month + Total sales in the second month
= 1200 + 900
= 2100

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of paid hours and the total cost for those hours.

James gets 1 hour free, so he pays for 8 hours (9 PM - 5 PM = 4 hours, but he gets 1 hour free, so 4 - 1 = 3 hours, and then 3 + 5 = 8 hours).

The first hour costs $15. Each hour after that costs twice the cost, which is $15 * 2 = $30.

So, the cost for the first hour is $15, and the cost for the remaining 7 hours is $30 * 7 = $210.

The total cost is $15 + $210 = $225.

The final answer is: $225"
"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to determine the total amount she should have received and subtract the amount she actually received.

First, let's calculate the total amount Sally should have received. Since her weekly wage is $300, and she worked for the entire week, she should have received $300.

However, we know that her bank account now holds $420, which is $220 more than the initial $200. This means that the $220 difference is the amount she received from her wage.

To find out how much was withheld, we need to subtract the amount she received from her total wage. 

Amount withheld = Total wage - Amount received
Amount withheld = $300 - $220
Amount withheld = $80

"To determine the number of eggs Lori needs, we first need to find out how many deviled egg halves each guest will eat. Since each guest eats 3 deviled egg halves, and Lori is inviting 16 guests, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is 3 * 16 = 48.

Since Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many deviled egg halves 1 egg can make. This is 2 deviled egg halves per egg. 

Now, we divide the total number of deviled egg halves needed (48) by the number of deviled egg halves per egg (2). This gives us 48 / 2 = 24 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs (24) by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Lori needs. This gives us 24 / 12 = 2.

The cost of the plane is $150,000.

The hanger rental is $5000 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total hanger rental cost for the first year is $5000 * 12 = $60,000.

The fuel cost is twice the hanger rental, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month. The total fuel cost for the first year is $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

Now, we add up the costs: $150,000 (plane) + $60,000 (hanger rental) + $120,000 (fuel) = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"

"Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. We know that sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, which means the total number of sheep and geese is 20.

We can write the equation: S + G = 20.

We also know that the total number of animal legs is 70. Since sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs, we can write the equation: 4S + 2G = 70.

Now we have a system of two equations:

1) S + G = 20
2) 4S + 2G = 70

We can multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of G in both equations the same:

2S + 2G = 40

Now we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate G:

(4S + 2G) - (2S + 2G) = 70 - 40
2S = 30

Divide both sides by 2:

S = 15

"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the coffee. 

Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, and he wants a week's worth, which is 7 days. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but his favorite brand is sold out, so he buys the more expensive brand. The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand. 

20% of $5 is 0.2 * $5 = $1. So the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

The total cost of the coffee is 7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42.

He also buys a donut for $2. 

The total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

"To find the number of employees who oversee the company, we first need to find the number of management employees and then find 30% of that number.

First, let's find the number of management employees. 20% of 50 employees are management, so we multiply 50 by 0.2.

50 * 0.2 = 10

Now, we need to find 30% of the management employees. 30% of 10 is 0.3 * 10.

0.3 * 10 = 3

So, 3 employees oversee the company.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total amount of dry ingredients needed, we need to calculate the total amount of flour, sugar, and salt required for 16 muffins.

For flour, Svetlana needs 5 tablespoons per muffin, so for 16 muffins, she needs 5 * 16 = 80 tablespoons of flour.

For sugar, Svetlana needs 3 tablespoons per muffin, so for 16 muffins, she needs 3 * 16 = 48 tablespoons of sugar.

For salt, Svetlana needs 0.25 tablespoons per muffin, so for 16 muffins, she needs 0.25 * 16 = 4 tablespoons of salt.

Now, we add the total amount of flour, sugar, and salt to find the total amount of dry ingredients needed: 80 + 48 + 4 = 132 tablespoons.

The total amount of dry ingredients needed is 132 tablespoons."
"To find out how much candy each person would have after sharing, we need to first find the total amount of candy they have together. 

Robert had 3 pounds of candy, Cindy had 5 pounds of candy, and Aaron had 4 pounds of candy. 

Total candy = 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds

Since they are sharing the candy equally among themselves, we need to divide the total amount of candy by the number of people. 

Number of people = 3 (Robert, Cindy, and Aaron)

Candy per person = Total candy / Number of people
Candy per person = 12 / 3
Candy per person = 4

"Let's break down the information given:

- Christina recorded her mood every day for 30 days.
- The first 8 days were good.
- The next 8 days were bad.
- The next 8 days were neutral.
- The next 3 days were good, neutral, and good.

We know that Christina had 12 good days in total. Since the first 8 days were good, that accounts for 8 good days. The next 3 good days bring the total to 11 good days. However, we are told that Christina had 12 good days in total. This means there must be 1 more good day left in the month.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that Janey has 21 books and that this is 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has. 

Let's represent the number of books Sally has as 'x'. According to the problem, Janey has twice the number of books Sally has, plus 3. This can be written as an equation: 2x + 3 = 21.

To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 21 - 3, which simplifies to 2x = 18.

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for 'x': x = 18 / 2, which simplifies to x = 9.

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we need to first convert the initial height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we multiply 20 feet by 12 inches per foot.

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we know the bamboo grows 30 inches a day and it's currently 240 inches tall. To find out how many days it will take to reach 600 inches, we subtract the current height from the target height and divide by the daily growth rate.

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Now, we divide the remaining inches by the daily growth rate.

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. This means each dog has 1 toy. When 8 more dogs arrive, James needs 8 more toys to bring the total to 12 dogs with 1 toy each. So, he buys 8 more toys.

Now, there are 12 dogs, and James goes back to find that there are twice as many more dogs, which means there are 2 * 8 = 16 more dogs. This makes a total of 12 + 16 = 28 dogs. Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 16 more toys to bring the total to 28 dogs with 1 toy each.

However, when James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs those toys. This means he needs 16 - 3 = 13 toys for the remaining 25 dogs.

To find the total number of toys James needs, we add the initial 4 toys, the 8 toys he bought first, and the 13 toys he bought later. 

4 (initial toys) + 8 (first purchase) + 13 (second purchase) = 25

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much money Skyler invested, we need to calculate the remaining amount after Dylan and Frances' investments.

First, let's find out how much Dylan invested. Dylan's investment is 2/5 of the total amount, which is 2/5 * $1200 = $480.

Now, let's find out how much money is left after Dylan's investment. The remaining amount is $1200 - $480 = $720.

Next, Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, which is 2/3 * $720 = $480.

Now, let's find out how much money is left after Frances' investment. The remaining amount is $720 - $480 = $240.

Skyler's investment is the remaining amount, which is $240.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many signatures the sisters have in total so far. Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. 

Total signatures so far = Carol's signatures + Jennifer's signatures
Total signatures so far = 20 + 44
Total signatures so far = 64

The sisters want to reach a total of 100 signatures by the end of the summer. Since they already have 64 signatures, we need to find out how many more signatures they need to collect.

Signatures needed = Total signatures required - Total signatures so far
Signatures needed = 100 - 64
Signatures needed = 36

Since the sisters have three more weeks of summer vacation, they need to collect 36 signatures in the remaining time to reach their goal.

"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we first need to determine her hourly wage. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Karen works in two days. Since she works 3 hours per day, in two days she works 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we can multiply Karen's hourly wage by the number of hours she works to find her total earnings: $20 * 6 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we need to determine the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. 

Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can calculate the ratio as follows: 

36 hash browns / 6 potatoes = 6 hash browns per potato

Now, we can multiply this ratio by the total number of potatoes to find the total number of hash browns that can be made:

6 hash browns per potato * 96 potatoes = 576 hash browns

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

576"

The weight of one adult is 80 kg. 
The weight of 9 adults is 9 * 80 kg = 720 kg.

Since the elevator can support a maximum load of 700 kg, we need to find out how much more weight the group will add to the maximum load.

The excess weight is 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg.

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cookies Max and Summer have. 

Since Katarina has 68 cookies and she has 5 less than Max, Max must have 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, but we don't know how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. However, we can express the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as x. Then, Max has x + 12 cookies.

Since Max has 73 cookies, we can set up the equation x + 12 = 73. Solving for x, we get x = 73 - 12 = 61. So, the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, and Max has 73 cookies. Therefore, Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, we can find the total number of cookies by adding the number of cookies Katarina, Max, and Summer have: 68 + 73 + 96 = 237.

The final answer is: 237"
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to work backwards from the final design length. 

First, we know that the final design length is 140cm, and 20cm of that is the lace trim. So, the original length of the dress before adding the lace trim is 140cm - 20cm = 120cm.

Now, we know that the dress was extended by 50% of its original length. Let's call the original length 'x'. Then, the extended length is x + 50% of x, which is x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

We know that the extended length is 120cm, so we can set up the equation 1.5x = 120cm.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 1.5: x = 120cm / 1.5 = 80cm.

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode and then add them together.

First, let's find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in turtle mode. Since it takes 1 hour to mow the entire lawn in turtle mode, it will take 0.5 hours to mow half the lawn. We need to convert this to minutes, so we multiply 0.5 hours by 60 minutes per hour, which is 30 minutes.

Next, let's find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode. Since it takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn in rabbit mode, it will take 20 minutes to mow half the lawn.

Now, we add the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode: 30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes.

"Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t. We know that there are two twins and one triplet, so we can write the equation: 2T + t = 44.

We also know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write another equation: T = t + 7.

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first one: 2(t + 7) + t = 44.

Expanding the equation, we get: 2t + 14 + t = 44.

Combine like terms: 3t + 14 = 44.

Subtract 14 from both sides: 3t = 30.

Divide both sides by 3: t = 10.

Now that we know the age of the triplet, we can find the age of the older twin: T = t + 7 = 10 + 7 = 17.

Total homework time: 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

Since John has 3 hours before dinner, we need to convert the hours to minutes. 
3 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 180 minutes

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total available time to find out how many minutes John has to nap.
Time available for nap: 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to find the cost of one candy. We know that 5 lollipops and 4 candies cost $3.20. 

First, let's find the total cost of the lollipops: 5 lollipops * $0.40 = $2.00. 

Now, let's subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of the candies: $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20. 

Since there are 4 candies, the cost of one candy is $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, let's find the cost of 10 lollipops: 10 lollipops * $0.40 = $4.00.

The cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.00.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many coins Rong and Neil save per month. Rong saves 20 coins per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, which is 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate the total number of coins they save in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so Rong saves 20 * 12 = 240 coins per year, and Neil saves 28 * 12 = 336 coins per year.

Since they have been saving for 10 years, we need to multiply the number of coins they save per year by 10. Rong saves 240 * 10 = 2400 coins in 10 years, and Neil saves 336 * 10 = 3360 coins in 10 years.

The total number of coins they have is the sum of the coins saved by Rong and Neil, which is 2400 + 3360 = 5760.

"To find the total bill, we first need to calculate the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, which means the total bill is the heartworm check divided by 0.6. Let's call the total bill 'x'. Then, 0.6x = $40 + $20 (heartworm check). However, we don't know the cost of the heartworm check yet, so we'll express it in terms of x.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so the heartworm check is 0.6x. The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check, which is $40 + 0.6x. 

Since the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, we can set up the equation: 0.6x = 0.4x + $40. Subtracting 0.4x from both sides gives us 0.2x = $40. Dividing both sides by 0.2 gives us x = $200.

Now that we know the total bill is $200, we can find the cost of the heartworm check, which is 60% of $200, or 0.6 * $200 = $120.

John brought $125 with him, so to find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought: $125 - $200 = -$75. However, since we can't leave with a negative amount, this means John doesn't have enough money to pay the total bill.

The final answer is: $-75"

The cost of one banana is twice as much as one apple, so it's 2 * $0.5 = $1.
The cost of one orange is three times as much as one banana, so it's 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each type of fruit in one crate:
- Bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- Apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- Oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Adding these costs together, we get the total price of the crate: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

"To find the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter, we need to calculate the total number of squares and multiply it by the area of each square, which is 1 square foot.

First, let's find the number of blue squares. Since there are 4 more blue squares than red squares, and there are 14 red squares, the number of blue squares is 14 + 4 = 18.

Next, let's find the number of green squares. Since there are 6 more green squares than blue squares, and there are 18 blue squares, the number of green squares is 18 + 6 = 24.

Now, let's find the number of white squares. Since there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, and there are 24 green squares, the number of white squares is 24 - 12 = 12.

Now, let's add up the number of squares of each color: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

"To find out how many chairs Mia needs, we first need to determine the total number of chairs she has. Since there are 8 high chairs and the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs by multiplying 8 by 5.

8 high chairs * 5 = 40 regular chairs

Now, we add the number of high chairs and regular chairs to find the total number of chairs.

8 high chairs + 40 regular chairs = 48 chairs

Since there will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending, we need to find the total number of chairs required. Babies will use high chairs, so we add the number of adults and babies.

42 adults + 15 babies = 57 people

Since each person needs a chair, we need 57 chairs in total. To find out how many more chairs Mia needs, we subtract the number of chairs she has from the total number of chairs required.

57 total chairs - 48 available chairs = 9 more chairs

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total points collected by Adam, Betty, Martha, and Tom, and then subtract that from the minimum threshold of 400 points.

First, let's find Betty's points. Since Betty collected 30% more points than Adam, we can calculate it as follows:
Betty's points = Adam's points + (30% of Adam's points)
Betty's points = 50 + (0.3 * 50)
Betty's points = 50 + 15
Betty's points = 65

Now, let's find Tom's points. We know that Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom, and Martha's points are not given. However, we can express Martha's points in terms of Tom's points:
Martha's points = 3 * Tom's points

We also know that Tom has 30 points less than Betty:
Tom's points = Betty's points - 30
Tom's points = 65 - 30
Tom's points = 35

Now, we can find Martha's points:
Martha's points = 3 * Tom's points
Martha's points = 3 * 35
Martha's points = 105

Now, let's find the total points collected by the class:
Total points = Adam's points + Betty's points + Martha's points + Tom's points
Total points = 50 + 65 + 105 + 35
Total points = 255

To find the points the class is missing, we subtract the total points from the minimum threshold:
Points missing = Minimum threshold - Total points
Points missing = 400 - 255
Points missing = 145

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of dumplings each male ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males in the group, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

There are 6 females in the group, and each female ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

The total number of dumplings eaten by the group is 32 (males) + 18 (females) = 50.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Gerald initially received from the $100. 

The ratio of the money Gerald and Julia received is 3:2. This means that for every 3 parts Gerald gets, Julia gets 2 parts. The total number of parts is 3 + 2 = 5.

Since Gerald spent $10 on a book, we need to find out how much he initially received. Let's assume the value of 1 part is x. Then, Gerald's share is 3x and Julia's share is 2x.

We know that the total amount of money is $100, so we can set up the equation: 3x + 2x = 100

Combine like terms: 5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5: x = 20

Now that we know the value of 1 part is $20, we can find Gerald's initial amount: 3x = 3 * 20 = 60

Gerald initially received $60. He spent $10 on a book, so he has $60 - $10 = $50 left.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money they need to raise per hour to reach their goal. 

First, let's find out how much they still need to raise: 
$6300 (goal) - $2100 (raised so far) = $4200

Since they have been fundraising for 3 hours and raised $2100, we can find out their hourly rate by dividing the amount raised by the number of hours:
$2100 / 3 hours = $700 per hour

Now, we need to find out how many hours they need to fundraise to raise the remaining $4200:
$4200 / $700 per hour = 6 hours

So, they need to fundraise for 6 more hours to reach their goal.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage used for industrial purposes and then subtract that from 100%.

First, we find the percentage of the river's water used by Colorado City: 40%.

Then, we find the percentage of that used for industrial purposes: 80% of 40% is 0.8 * 0.4 = 0.32 or 32%.

Now, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from 100% to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes: 100% - 32% = 68%.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find out how much Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we first need to determine the total number of days in 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks would have 7 * 2 = 14 days.

Next, we need to find out the total amount Alex charges for 14 days. Since she charges $12 per day, we multiply the number of days by her daily rate: 14 * $12 = $168.

So, Alex charges $168 for 2 weeks of tutoring.

The final answer is: $168"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the rate at which the factory makes chocolate and vanilla ice cream per hour.

For chocolate ice cream, the factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours. To find the rate per hour, we divide the total quarts by the number of hours: 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour.

For vanilla ice cream, the factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours. To find the rate per hour, we divide the total quarts by the number of hours: 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we need to find the total quarts made in 48 hours. We multiply the rate per hour for each flavor by the total number of hours and add the results together: (50 quarts/hour * 48 hours) + (12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours) = 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts.

The final answer is: 3000"
"To find Marcus' total bill, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items he ordered and then apply the 10% discount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of each type of item:

- 5 croissants at $3.00 apiece: 5 x $3.00 = $15.00
- 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each: 4 x $2.50 = $10.00
- 3 mini quiches at $4.00 apiece: 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
- 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 apiece: 13 x $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
$15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Since Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off his purchase, we need to calculate the discount amount:
10% of $50.00 = 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost:
$50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many scoops Erin can buy with her $6.00. Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide the total amount of money Erin has by the cost of each scoop.

$6.00 Ã· $1.50 = 4

This means Erin can buy 4 scoops of ice cream. However, the deal is buy 2 scoops get 1 free, so we need to consider this when calculating the total number of scoops Erin can get.

If Erin buys 2 scoops, she will get 1 free, making it 3 scoops for the price of 2. To maximize the number of scoops, Erin should buy 2 sets of 2 scoops and 1 free scoop, which is a total of 6 scoops.

"To find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total amount of candy each of them eats in two weeks and subtract that from their initial amount.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56, so she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.

Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42, so she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total number of tiles needed, we first need to calculate the area of two-thirds of the bathroom. 

The area of the entire bathroom is 36 sq ft. To find two-thirds of this area, we multiply 36 by 2/3.

36 * (2/3) = 36 * 2 / 3 = 72 / 3 = 24

So, two-thirds of the bathroom is 24 sq ft. 

Now, we need to find the number of tiles needed to cover this area. For every square foot, Mr Boarden needs 24 tiles. 

To find the total number of tiles needed, we multiply the area by the number of tiles per square foot.

24 sq ft * 24 tiles/sq ft = 24 * 24 = 576

"To find out how much James saved, we first need to calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries and then compare it to the cost of buying them at the store.

The cost of picking blueberries is $20 (initial cost) + $1.5 per pound * 30 pounds (total weight picked) = $20 + $45 = $65.

The cost of buying the blueberries at the store is $2.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $75.

The difference in cost is $75 (store price) - $65 (picking price) = $10.

So, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries instead of buying them at the store.

"To find the total number of taps, we need to calculate the number of taps for each scenario and add them together.

When Helga's arms are at her sides, she taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute. The combined rate is 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute.

When her arms are raised, she taps at a rate of 200 taps per minute with each foot. The combined rate is 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute.

Helga dances for 5 minutes in total, with her arms raised for 2 minutes and her arms at her sides for 3 minutes.

The number of taps when her arms are at her sides is 550 taps/minute * 3 minutes = 1650 taps.

The number of taps when her arms are raised is 400 taps/minute * 2 minutes = 800 taps.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the potential damage to Ron's car.

The cost of fixing the pothole includes the fine for unauthorized road maintenance and the cost of the asphalt. 

The fine for unauthorized road maintenance is $120. 
The cost of 3 buckets of asphalt is 3 * $25 = $75.

So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $120 + $75 = $195.

The potential damage to Ron's car is $450.

To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we subtract the total cost of fixing the pothole from the potential damage to his car: $450 - $195 = $255.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many slices were eaten by Bryce and his friends, and then subtract that from the total number of slices.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 5 people in total, 3 people ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Each pizza has 12 slices, so each person ate 2/3 * 12 = 8 slices. Since there are 3 people, they ate 3 * 8 = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends ate Â¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 people, they ate 2 * 3/4 * 12 = 9 slices.

In total, 24 + 9 = 33 slices were eaten. Since there are 5 pizzas in total, and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60. 

The number of slices left is 60 - 33 = 27.

"To find the average time the cat and dog take to eat the sausages, we first need to determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. 

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. Since the dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes, we can calculate the dog's time as follows:

Dog's time = (2/3) * Cat's time
Dog's time = (2/3) * 30 minutes
Dog's time = 20 minutes

Now, we have the time taken by both the cat and the dog. To find the average time, we add their times and divide by 2:

Average time = (Cat's time + Dog's time) / 2
Average time = (30 minutes + 20 minutes) / 2
Average time = 50 minutes / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches
Adding the 4 inches, we get:
96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. Then, the length of one of Topher's shoes can be represented as 9x + 10. We know this is equal to 100 inches, so we can set up the equation:

9x + 10 = 100

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us:

9x = 90

Dividing both sides of the equation by 9 gives us:

x = 10

So, one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches long.

"To find the total number of windows smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed from the students' cars and the teachers' cars separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of windows smashed from the students' cars. There are 64 students' cars with 4 windows each. A quarter of the students' cars' windows are smashed, which is 1/4 * 64 = 16 cars. Since each car has 4 windows, the total number of windows smashed from the students' cars is 16 * 4 = 64.

Next, let's find the number of windows smashed from the teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars with 2 windows each. Three-fourths of the teachers' cars' windows are smashed, which is 3/4 * 32 = 24 cars. Since each car has 2 windows, the total number of windows smashed from the teachers' cars is 24 * 2 = 48.

Now, let's add the number of windows smashed from the students' cars and the teachers' cars to find the total number of windows smashed. 64 + 48 = 112.

2/5 of 5000 is (2/5) * 5000 = 2000 people who voted by midday.

So, the number of people remaining by midday is 5000 - 2000 = 3000.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 

2/3 of 3000 is (2/3) * 3000 = 2000 people who voted by 16:00.

"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers needed, we first need to calculate the total number of s'mores required. 

9 kids want 2 s'mores each, so the total number of s'mores for kids is 9 * 2 = 18. 
6 adults will eat 1 s'more each, so the total number of s'mores for adults is 6 * 1 = 6. 
The total number of s'mores needed is 18 (for kids) + 6 (for adults) = 24.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large s'mores, we need to divide the total number of s'mores by 8 to find out how many sleeves are needed. 
24 s'mores / 8 s'mores per sleeve = 3 sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need to divide the total number of sleeves needed by 3 to find out how many boxes are required. 
3 sleeves / 3 sleeves per box = 1 box.

Therefore, they will need 1 box of graham crackers.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the ages of Dora's father and mother. 

Since Dora is 15 years old, and her father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age, we can calculate her father's age as follows:
Father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8
Father's age = 2 * 15 + 8
Father's age = 30 + 8
Father's age = 38

Now, we know that Dora's mother is four years younger than her father. So, we can calculate her mother's age as follows:
Mother's age = Father's age - 4
Mother's age = 38 - 4
Mother's age = 34

Now that we have the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother, we can calculate the total combined age:
Total combined age = Dora's age + Father's age + Mother's age
Total combined age = 15 + 38 + 34
Total combined age = 87

"To find the number of votes candidate C received, we first need to determine the number of votes candidate B received. 

Candidate A received 20% of the votes, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes.

Candidate B received 50% more than candidate A's votes, so we need to calculate 50% of 20 and add it to 20. 
50% of 20 is 0.5 * 20 = 10. 
So, candidate B received 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

Since there are 100 voters in total, and candidate A and B together received 20 + 30 = 50 votes, candidate C received the remaining votes. 
The remaining votes are 100 - 50 = 50.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we can calculate Beck's initial apples as follows:

Beck's initial apples = Boris's apples - 23
Beck's initial apples = 100 - 23
Beck's initial apples = 77

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, Beck's new total is:

Beck's new apples = Beck's initial apples + 10
Beck's new apples = 77 + 10
Beck's new apples = 87

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris. Boris still has 100 apples, and Beck has 87 apples. So, the difference is:

"To find the number of boys in each class, we first need to find the total number of girls in both classes. Since 40% of the students in each class are girls, and there are 80 students in total, we can set up an equation to find the number of students in each class.

Let x be the number of students in each class. Then, 2x = 80 (since there are two classes with the same number of students).

Solving for x, we get x = 80 / 2 = 40.

Now that we know there are 40 students in each class, we can find the number of girls in each class. 40% of 40 is 0.4 * 40 = 16 girls in each class.

Since there are 40 students in each class, and 16 are girls, the number of boys in each class is 40 - 16 = 24.

Difference in cost = Total cost of the first amusement park - Total cost of the second amusement park
= $76 - $48
= $28

The family will be able to save $28 if they choose the second amusement park over the first.

The final answer is: $28"
"To find out how much money the tomato vendor saves a week, we need to first calculate the daily savings and then multiply it by 7.

The vendor used to buy 500 tomatoes a day at $.5 each, so his daily cost was 500 * $.5 = $250.

With the new vendor, he buys the same 500 tomatoes at $.4 each, so his new daily cost is 500 * $.4 = $200.

The daily savings is the difference between the old cost and the new cost, which is $250 - $200 = $50.

To find the weekly savings, we multiply the daily savings by 7: $50 * 7 = $350.

The final answer is: $350"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Sean has 56 marbles. Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, we can find the number of marbles Cal has by multiplying Sean's marbles by 2.

Cal's marbles = 2 * Sean's marbles
Cal's marbles = 2 * 56
Cal's marbles = 112

We also know that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. To find the number of marbles Carl has, we can multiply Sean's marbles by 4.

Carl's marbles = 4 * Sean's marbles
Carl's marbles = 4 * 56
Carl's marbles = 224

Now, we need to find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined. We can do this by adding the number of marbles Carl and Cal have.

Total marbles = Carl's marbles + Cal's marbles
Total marbles = 224 + 112
Total marbles = 336

The final answer is: 336"
"To find out how many groups are needed, we first need to determine the size of each group. Since there are 54 students and they are to be separated into 6 groups of equal size, we can divide 54 by 6 to find the size of each group.

54 Ã· 6 = 9

However, the problem states that the activity requires 12 groups. To find out how many more groups are needed, we need to divide the total number of students by the new number of groups.

54 Ã· 12 = 4.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of additional groups needed, not the total number of groups. 

To find the number of additional groups needed, we subtract the original number of groups from the new number of groups.

12 - 6 = 6

So, 6 more groups are needed to form 12 groups of equal size."
"To find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented in a week and then multiply it by 8 (2 months * 4 weeks/month).

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented in a week:

- Weekdays: 5 days * 60 chairs/day = 300 chairs
- Weekends: 2 days * 100 chairs/day = 200 chairs
- Total chairs rented in a week: 300 + 200 = 500 chairs

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months:
- Total chairs rented in 8 weeks: 500 chairs/week * 8 weeks = 4000 chairs

The final answer is: 4000"
"Let's break down the events step by step:

Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas.

1. Arnold stole half of the bananas: 48 / 2 = 24 bananas stolen, so Gunther had 48 - 24 = 24 bananas left.
2. Gunther added 25 bananas: 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.
3. Arnold stole 12 bananas: 49 - 12 = 37 bananas left.
4. Gunther added 6 bananas: 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

So, when Gunther began counting, he found 43 bananas in the pile.

The final answer is: 43"
"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year, we first need to calculate the total electricity bill for a year. Since the electricity bill is $100 per month, we multiply this by 12 months to get the yearly bill.

Yearly electricity bill = $100/month * 12 months = $1200

Since there are 4 roommates, we divide the yearly bill by 4 to find out how much each roommate will pay.

$1200 / 4 = $300

So each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity."
"To find out how many glasses and plates Jeff has now, we need to calculate the total number of glasses and plates he initially sent and then subtract the number of broken ones.

First, let's calculate the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can multiply the number of dozens by 12.

Glasses: 8 dozen * 12 = 96 glasses
Plates: 4 dozen * 12 = 48 plates

Now, let's subtract the number of broken glasses and plates from the initial total.

Glasses: 96 - 10 = 86
Plates: 48 - 6 = 42

So, Jeff has 86 glasses and 42 plates now. 

The final answer is: 
Glasses: 86
Plates: 42"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

First, she trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 30 is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons.

Now, she has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

Now, she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the remaining large stickers for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she has 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 60 small buttons.

Now, let's count the total number of buttons she has: 27 small buttons + 20 large buttons + 60 small buttons = 107 buttons.

The final answer is: 107"

On Monday, Joey played 2 matches.
On Friday, Joey played 1 match.
On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 matches.

Now, let's add up the total number of matches: 2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7 matches.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as 'x'. Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, the number of votes in favor can be represented as 2x.

We know that the total number of people on the council is 33. This means the sum of the votes in favor and against the new regulation should equal 33.

So, we can write the equation: x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms: 3x = 33

Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for x: x = 11

Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, we can find the number of votes in favor by multiplying x by 2: 2x = 2 * 11 = 22

The final answer is: 22"

So, you will pay $133 after the discount.

The final answer is: $133"
"To find the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last, we need to first find the total number of songs in all the playlists. Since each playlist has 300 songs and there are 20 playlists, the total number of songs is 300 * 20 = 6000.

Since each song is 10 hours long, we multiply the total number of songs by the length of each song to find the total hours. So, 6000 songs * 10 hours/song = 60000 hours.

The final answer is: 60000"
"To find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we first need to find the number of people who think horse #2 will win and then the number of people who think horse #7 will win.

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. To find 20% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.2.

50 * 0.2 = 10

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Now, we need to find the number of people who think horse #7 will win. 60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. The remaining people are 50 - 10 = 40.

60% of 40 is 0.6 * 40 = 24.

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

Now, we need to find the number of people who think horse #12 will win. The total number of people who think either horse #2 or horse #7 will win is 10 + 24 = 34.

The number of people who think horse #12 will win is 50 - 34 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. 

Let's denote the total number of Pomeranians as P. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can set up the equation:

1/3 * P = 6

To solve for P, we can multiply both sides by 3:

P = 6 * 3
P = 18

So, there are 18 Pomeranians. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can denote the total number of puppies as T. We can set up the equation:

2/3 * T = 18

To solve for T, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

T = 18 * (3/2)
T = 27

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much more Jayden needs to buy the camera, we first need to calculate how much money he has after receiving the money from his sister. 

Jayden initially had $70. His sister gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. 

So, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115.

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera: $200 - $115 = $85.

Therefore, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.

The final answer is: $85"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

Let's denote the number of cases of shingles the second house needs as 'x'. Since the first house needs 1/2 of what the second house needs, the first house needs x/2 cases of shingles.

We know that the third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases of shingles.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. We can set up an equation to represent this:

x + (x/2) + x = 250

To simplify the equation, we can multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + x + 2x = 500

Combine like terms:

5x = 500

Now, divide both sides by 5:

x = 100

Since the third house needs x cases of shingles, and we found that x = 100, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of each person's purchase and then add them together.

Leila buys 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so her total cost is 3 * $2 = $6.

Jack buys 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so his total cost is 5 * $1 = $5.

Chase buys 1 head of lettuce at $3, so his total cost is $3.

Now, let's add their costs together: $6 (Leila) + $5 (Jack) + $3 (Chase) = $14.

"To find the number of pears George has, we need to calculate 45% of the number of bananas and add it to the number of bananas. 

First, let's find 45% of 200 bananas:
45% of 200 = 0.45 * 200 = 90

Now, let's add 90 to the number of bananas:
200 + 90 = 290

Since George has 45% more pears than bananas, the number of pears is also 290.

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and pears:
200 (bananas) + 290 (pears) = 490

The final answer is: 490"
"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to subtract the cost of the ball from the amount of money Marissa had initially. 

Marissa had $80 initially and spent $20 on the ball. 

$80 (initial money) - $20 (cost of the ball) = $60

Now, we need to find out how many candy bars Marissa can buy with $60, given that each candy bar costs $5.

$60 (remaining money) / $5 (cost of each candy bar) = 12

So, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

12"
"To find out how much money Sam needs to spend to make 4 liters of juice, we first need to determine how many kilograms of oranges are required to make 4 liters of juice. Since Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges to make 1 liter of juice, we can multiply this by 4 to find the total amount of oranges needed for 4 liters.

5 kilograms/orange * 4 liters/orange = 20 kilograms/orange

Now, we know that each kilogram of oranges costs $3. To find the total cost, we multiply the total amount of oranges needed by the cost per kilogram.

20 kilograms/orange * $3/kilogram = $60

So, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice.

The final answer is: $60"
"Let's break down the information given. Ezra has read 300 books this hour. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, Ahmed must have read half the number of books Ezra read. 

So, Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books this hour.

Ezra decided to read 150 more books, but that's not relevant to the question of how many books they've read altogether. We only need to consider the books they've already read.

To find the total number of books they've read, we add the books read by Ezra and Ahmed: 300 (Ezra) + 150 (Ahmed) = 450.

The final numerical answer is: 450"
"To find out how much Tanya earned, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately and then add them together.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total earnings for the hours worked would be 5 hours * $15/hour = $75. Additionally, she earns $5 per day for teaching more than 3 classes, so she earns an extra $5 for Monday. Therefore, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her earnings for the hours worked would be 2 hours * $15/hour = $30. Since she teaches less than 3 classes, she doesn't earn the extra $5 per day. Therefore, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

Now, let's add her earnings for both days: $80 (Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) = $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"To find the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

The company sold 5 vanilla scents and there are 4 vanilla scents available, so the total number of vanilla scents sold is 5 * 4 = 20.

The company sold 2 fruity scents and there are 8 fruity scents available, so the total number of fruity scents sold is 2 * 8 = 16.

Now, we need to find the difference between the total number of vanilla scents sold and the total number of fruity scents sold. 

Difference = Total vanilla scents sold - Total fruity scents sold
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate how much money Bennet will make from selling the eggplants. 

He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount he will make from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, and he will make $60 from the eggplants, he needs to make $135 - $60 = $75 from selling the corn.

He has 25 ears of corn, and he needs to make $75 from them. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the total amount he needs to make from corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25).

$75 / 25 = $3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total time Tatiana has available for soccer, video games, and reading, we need to add the hours she has on Saturday and Sunday. 

Total time available = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

She reads for 3 hours, so the remaining time for soccer and video games is:
Remaining time = Total time available - Time spent reading
Remaining time = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time:
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

Now, we can find the time spent playing soccer:
Time spent playing soccer = Remaining time - Time spent playing video games
Time spent playing soccer = 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we need to divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time available and multiply by 100:
Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (Time spent playing soccer / Total time available) * 100
Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100 = 50%

"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps of the problem.

Anthony started with 50 pencils. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon. 

1/2 of 50 is 50 * 0.5 = 25 pencils given to Brandon. 
So, Anthony has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.

Then, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. 

3/5 of 25 is 25 * 3/5 = 15 pencils given to Charlie. 
So, Anthony has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to drive to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Jack to drive to the museum:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time = 2 hours

Since he drives to the museum and back, we need to multiply the time by 2:

Total driving time = 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours

Now, we add the time he spends at the museum to the total driving time:

Total time = Total driving time + Time at the museum
Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time = 10 hours

"To find out how many wheels Henry will need in total, we need to calculate the number of wheels required for the cars and the motorcycles separately and then add them together.

For the cars, Henry needs 4 wheels for each of the 57 cars. So, the total number of wheels required for the cars is 57 * 4 = 228.

For the motorcycles, Henry needs 2 wheels for each of the 73 motorcycles. So, the total number of wheels required for the motorcycles is 73 * 2 = 146.

Now, we add the total number of wheels required for the cars and the motorcycles: 228 + 146 = 374.

Since Henry has a box with 650 wheels, we subtract the total number of wheels required from the total number of wheels available: 650 - 374 = 276.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how many movies are in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of movies in series = Total movies / 3
= 600 / 3
= 200 movies

Since Mike can buy these series movies for $6 each, we can calculate the cost of these movies as follows:

Cost of series movies = Number of movies in series * Cost of series movies
= 200 * $6
= $1200

Now, let's find out how many movies are not in series. We can do this by subtracting the number of movies in series from the total number of movies:

Number of movies not in series = Total movies - Number of movies in series
= 600 - 200
= 400 movies

Now, let's find out how many of these movies are older movies. Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of older movies = Number of movies not in series * 0.4
= 400 * 0.4
= 160 movies

Since older movies cost $5 each, we can calculate the cost of these movies as follows:

Cost of older movies = Number of older movies * Cost of older movies
= 160 * $5
= $800

Now, let's find out how many movies are normal movies. We can do this by subtracting the number of older movies from the number of movies not in series:

Number of normal movies = Number of movies not in series - Number of older movies
= 400 - 160
= 240 movies

Since normal movies cost $10 each, we can calculate the cost of these movies as follows:

Cost of normal movies = Number of normal movies * Cost of normal movies
= 240 * $10
= $2400

Now, let's add up the cost of all the movies to find the total cost:

Total cost = Cost of series movies + Cost of older movies + Cost of normal movies
= $1200 + $800 + $2400
= $4400

The final answer is: $4400"

"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by both driving and hiking. 

First, let's find the speed at which they hiked. They drove at 50 miles per hour, and they hiked at 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of 50 is 25, and 5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the distance they drove. They drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time, so the distance they drove is 50 * 6 = 300 miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time, so the distance they hiked is 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

The total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked. Total distance = 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

The final answer is: 330"
"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the points each of them earns from enemies, berries, and the time left on the timer.

Let's assume Emma's score from enemies is x. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava's score from enemies will be x + 8.

Emma collects 3 fewer berries than Ava, so let's assume Ava collects y berries. Emma collects y - 3 berries.

The time left on the timer is 4 seconds less for Ava, so let's assume Emma finishes the level in z seconds. Ava finishes the level in z - 4 seconds.

The points from enemies are 10x for Emma and 10(x + 8) for Ava.

The points from berries are 5(y - 3) for Emma and 5y for Ava.

The points from the time left on the timer are 30z for Emma and 30(z - 4) for Ava.

The total score for Emma is 10x + 5(y - 3) + 30z.
The total score for Ava is 10(x + 8) + 5y + 30(z - 4).

Simplifying the equations:
Emma's total score: 10x + 5y - 15 + 30z
Ava's total score: 10x + 80 + 5y + 30z - 120

Now, let's find the difference between their scores:
Difference = Ava's score - Emma's score
= (10x + 80 + 5y + 30z - 120) - (10x + 5y - 15 + 30z)
= 80 - 120 - 15 + 5y - 5y + 30z - 30z

"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that are already known. Since two pizzas cost 30 dollars each, the total cost for these two pizzas is 2 * 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract the cost of these two pizzas from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the total cost of the other two pizzas. The total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars, so the total cost of the other two pizzas is 64 - 60 = 4 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can find the cost of each pizza by dividing the total cost of the other two pizzas by 2. The cost of each of the other two pizzas is 4 / 2 = 2 dollars.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Chase and Rider ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days, which is a total of 3 * 5 = 15 times.

On the two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which means they ride 2 * 3 = 6 times each day.

So, for the two special days, they ride a total of 6 * 2 = 12 times.

Now, let's add the total number of times they ride on the usual days (15) and the special days (12) to get the total number of times they ride in a week.

15 + 12 = 27

"Let's break down the information given:

Initially, Bob had 7 fish in his pond: 3 orange and 4 white.

After buying more fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's denote the number of white fish he bought as 'x'. The number of orange fish he bought would then be 2x.

The total number of fish in the pond after buying more fish is 7 (initial fish) + 17 (new fish) = 24.

The total number of orange fish in the pond is 3 (initial orange fish) + 2x (new orange fish) = 3 + 2x.

The total number of white fish in the pond is 4 (initial white fish) + x (new white fish) = 4 + x.

Since the total number of fish in the pond is 24, we can set up the equation: 3 + 2x + 4 + x = 24.

Combine like terms: 7 + 3x = 24.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 17.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 17/3.

However, since we can't have a fraction of a fish, we need to re-examine the problem. The issue here is that the number of fish bought is 17, which is not a multiple of 3. This means that the number of white fish bought must be a whole number.

Let's re-examine the equation: 3 + 2x + 4 + x = 24.

"To calculate the weekly fuel consumption, we need to determine the total miles driven per week and then divide it by the car's fuel efficiency.

The one-way distance between home and office is 5 miles, and Andy drives to and from work, so the total daily distance is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles.

Since Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, the total weekly distance is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Now, we can calculate the weekly fuel consumption by dividing the total weekly distance by the car's fuel efficiency: 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

The price of regular gas is $3/gallon, so the weekly fuel cost is 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

The final numerical answer is: $15"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Carrie was given and then subtract the amount she spent.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie was given. She received 10 twenties and 140 quarters. 

The value of 10 twenties is 10 x $20 = $200. 
The value of 140 quarters is 140 x $0.25 = $35.

So, the total amount of money Carrie was given is $200 + $35 = $235.

Carrie spent all the quarters, which is $35, and 3/5 of the twenties. 
3/5 of $200 is (3/5) x $200 = $120.

The total amount of money Carrie spent is $35 + $120 = $155.

Therefore, the total amount of money she paid for lunch is $155.

The final answer is: $155"

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to determine the total percentage of smart TVs and analog TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 or 25%. One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 or 12.5%. 

The total percentage of smart TVs and analog TVs sold is 25% + 12.5% = 37.5%. 

Since the rest of the TVs are OLED, we subtract the total percentage of smart and analog TVs from 100% to find the percentage of OLED TVs. 

100% - 37.5% = 62.5%

Now, we can find the number of OLED TVs sold by multiplying the total number of TVs sold (40) by the percentage of OLED TVs (62.5% or 0.625).

Number of OLED TVs sold = 40 * 0.625 = 25

"To find out how much money John is missing, we first need to determine how much the school will cover. Since the school is covering half the cost of the trip, we can calculate this as half of $300, which is $300 / 2 = $150.

Now, we know that John has $50 and the total cost of the trip is $300. Since the school is covering $150, John only needs to cover the remaining amount. This can be calculated as $300 - $150 = $150. However, John already has $50, so we need to subtract this from the total amount he needs to cover, which is $150 - $50 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the temperature at night and then calculate how many logs Carson needs to burn to raise the temperature to 32 degrees.

First, let's find the temperature at night. It's 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the day, and the day temperature is 45 degrees. 

Night temperature = Day temperature - 33
Night temperature = 45 - 33
Night temperature = 12 degrees

Since the pipes will freeze at 32 degrees, Carson needs to raise the temperature from 12 degrees to 32 degrees. 

Temperature to be raised = 32 - 12
Temperature to be raised = 20 degrees

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we divide the temperature to be raised by the temperature each log raises.

Number of logs = Temperature to be raised / Temperature per log
Number of logs = 20 / 5
Number of logs = 4

"To solve this problem, we first need to find the total number of groups formed. Since 90 people were divided into 9-person groups, we can find the total number of groups by dividing 90 by 9.

90 people / 9 people per group = 10 groups

Next, we need to find out how many groups had members bring back 2 seashells each. Since 3/5 of the groups did this, we can multiply the total number of groups by 3/5.

3/5 * 10 groups = 6 groups

Now, we need to find the total number of seashells brought back by these 6 groups. Since each group brought back 2 seashells, we can multiply the number of groups by 2.

6 groups * 2 seashells per group = 12 seashells

172 - 47 = 125

Then, 13 people got on, so we add 13 to 125:
125 + 13 = 138

At the next stop, 38 people got off, so we subtract 38 from 138:
138 - 38 = 100

Therefore, there are 100 people on the train.

"To find out how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to calculate the total amount of money he earns from the bottle caps he finds each day and then multiply it by the number of days in the month.

Damien finds 10 bottle caps a day, and each bottle cap is worth $0.25. So, the amount of money he earns per day is:

10 bottle caps/day * $0.25/bottle cap = $2.50/day

Now, we multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in the month:

$2.50/day * 30 days = $75

Therefore, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month.

"To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to calculate the number of male lions and add it to the number of female lions and lion cubs.

First, we know there are 12 female lions. The number of male lions is half the number of female lions, so the number of male lions is 12 / 2 = 6.

Next, we add the number of male lions to the number of female lions: 12 (female lions) + 6 (male lions) = 18.

Then, we add the number of lion cubs to the total number of adult lions: 18 (adult lions) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32.

The total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans and then subtract that from the $50 bill.

First, let's find the discounted price of the jeans. The original price is $40, and it's 25% off. To find 25% of $40, we multiply $40 by 0.25:

$40 * 0.25 = $10

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price:

$40 - $10 = $30

So, the discounted price of the jeans is $30.

Now, let's find out how much money Mike will have left over after paying with a $50 bill:

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first determine the total number of employees after three months. 

The company initially has 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. So, after one month, the total number of employees will be 200 + 20 = 220. 

After two months, the total number of employees will be 220 + 20 = 240. 

After three months, the total number of employees will be 240 + 20 = 260.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees. Each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month. 

The total amount of money paid to the initial 200 employees after three months will be 200 * 3 * 4000 = 2,400,000.

The total amount of money paid to the 20 new employees hired in the first month after three months will be 20 * 3 * 4000 = 240,000.

The total amount of money paid to the 20 new employees hired in the second month after three months will be 20 * 3 * 4000 = 240,000.

The total amount of money paid to the 20 new employees hired in the third month after three months will be 20 * 3 * 4000 = 240,000.

Now, we add up the total amount of money paid to all employees: 2,400,000 + 240,000 + 240,000 + 240,000 = 3,120,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is 3,120,000.

"To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours.

Billy's initial hourly wage was $10. After 2 months, he got a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new hourly wage $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. On his first anniversary, he got another raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final hourly wage $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, which was $10. So, Sally's starting salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. 

Now, let's calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours:

Billy's total earnings = 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230
Sally's total earnings = 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210

The difference in their earnings is $230 - $210 = $20.

Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we'll consider the context of the problem. Bubbles is buying stuffed goats to make up 30% of her collection, so we'll round to the nearest whole number that will allow her to achieve this percentage.

To find the total number of stuffed animals after buying the goats, we'll set up an equation: 

Let x be the number of stuffed goats she buys. The total number of stuffed animals after buying the goats will be 14 + x.

We want 30% of the total number of stuffed animals to be the number of stuffed goats, so we can set up the equation: 

0.3(14 + x) = x

Solving for x, we get:

4.2 + 0.3x = x
0.7x = 4.2
x = 4.2 / 0.7
x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total hours Kris has played and subtract that from the target of 30 hours.

First, let's calculate the hours Kris played in the first 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days. If Kris plays for half an hour every day, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in the first 2 weeks.

Next, let's calculate the hours Kris played in the next week. If Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in the next week.

Now, let's add the hours Kris played in both periods: 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we subtract the total hours played from the target of 30 hours: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between the two distances.

The first car travels at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 miles/hour x 2 hours = 120 miles

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 70 miles/hour x 2 hours = 140 miles

The difference in distance between the two cars is:
Difference = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

So, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost James paid for the ring, we need to calculate the premium first and then add it to the total cost of the diamond and gold.

The total cost of the diamond and gold is $600 + $300 = $900.

The premium is 30% of $900, which is 0.3 x $900 = $270.

To find the total cost, we add the premium to the total cost of the diamond and gold: $900 + $270 = $1170.

The final answer is: $1170"
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade level:

- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice the fourth-graders', so it's 2 * 40 = 80 out of 100 passed

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed:
340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 80 (fifth-graders) = 460 students passed

Next, let's calculate the total number of students in the school:
500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000 students

Now, we can find the overall pass rate:
(460 students passed / 1000 total students) * 100 = 46%

The final answer is: 46"
"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we first need to determine how many square inches of mosaic he can make with the glass chips he has. 

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, and each bag holds 72 chips, we need to find out how many chips Milo has in total. 

Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, so he has 2 * 72 = 144 chips.

Since it takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch, we can divide the total number of chips by 12 to find out how many square inches Milo can make: 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, and he can make 12 square inches of mosaic, we can find the length of the mosaic by dividing the total square inches by the height: 12 / 3 = 4 inches.

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount each group of students drank and add them together. 

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so the total amount they drank is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. 

16 students drank 2 quarts each, so the total amount they drank is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we know that 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts. 

So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party in gallons is 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Initially, Dale had 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150, but since he didn't have that many, it means he sold all 100 he had and 50 more that he didn't have yet. So, he actually sold 100 candies and has 50 more to fulfill the orders.

Then, he ordered 100 more candies. Now, he has 100 (initial candies) + 100 (new order) = 200 candies in total.

Since he has already sold 100 candies, he still needs to sell 200 - 100 = 100 candies to fulfill all the orders.

The final answer is: 100"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of each month and then subtract the initial number of students from it.

At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students.

- At the end of January, the number of students doubles, so there are 10 * 2 = 20 students.
- At the end of February, the number of students doubles again, so there are 20 * 2 = 40 students.
- At the end of March, the number of students doubles again, so there are 40 * 2 = 80 students.
- At the end of April, the number of students doubles again, so there are 80 * 2 = 160 students.
- At the end of May, the number of students doubles again, so there are 160 * 2 = 320 students.

Now, let's subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May to find the additional students: 320 - 10 = 310.

The final answer is: 310"
"To find the total number of branches Felix climbed, we need to divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch. 

Total money made = $105
Cost per branch = $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week, which has 5 days, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 5
Average branches per day = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers and then subtract the petals that were lost.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

However, Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, so we need to subtract 4 petals (1 from each set) from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

The final answer is: 97"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many marshmallows are left after John and DeSean make their S'mores and account for the ones they dropped. 

First, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, and they each made 9 S'mores, the total number of marshmallows used is 9 + 9 = 18.

However, they also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, so we need to subtract those from the total number of marshmallows used. But since we are trying to find out how many are left, we should subtract the total used from the original amount. 

So, the total number of marshmallows left is 35 - (18 + 3) = 35 - 21 = 14.

Since there are 14 marshmallows left, and there are two kids, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to find out how many each kid can have. 

14 / 2 = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person plays and then determine how many quarters are used.

Jack can play for 20 minutes. His two friends who are worse can play for half as long, which is 20 / 2 = 10 minutes. The friend who is better can play for 1.5 times as long, which is 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes.

Since they play for 4 hours, we need to convert this to minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total time each person plays:

- Jack: 240 minutes
- Two worse friends: 2 * 10 minutes = 20 minutes each, so 20 * 2 = 40 minutes total
- Better friend: 240 minutes

Now, let's calculate the total time played by all friends: 240 (Jack) + 40 (worse friends) + 240 (better friend) = 520 minutes.

Since Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, we need to calculate how many 20-minute intervals are in 520 minutes: 520 / 20 = 26.

However, we need to account for the fact that the better friend plays for 240 minutes, which is 12 intervals of 20 minutes. The two worse friends play for 40 minutes, which is 2 intervals of 20 minutes. Jack plays for 240 minutes, which is 12 intervals of 20 minutes.

So, the total number of intervals is 12 (better friend) + 2 (worse friends) + 12 (Jack) = 26 intervals.

Since each interval costs 1 quarter, the total amount of money used is 26 quarters.

To convert this to dollars, we multiply by the value of a quarter (0.25): 26 * 0.25 = 6.5 dollars.

The final answer is: $6.50"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as Z, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of salt as S, the amount of sugar as S, and the amount of oil as O.

We are given that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so F = Z.

We are also given that she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so S = S.

We are given that she uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.

We are given that she uses twice as much salt as zest, so S = 2Z.

Since F = Z, we can substitute F with Z in the equation S = 2Z, so S = 2Z.

Now we have O = 2S and S = 2Z. We can substitute S with 2Z in the equation O = 2S, so O = 2(2Z) = 4Z.

Since the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, the sum of all the ingredients is 10. We can write the equation as Z + F + S + S + O = 10.

Substituting F = Z and S = 2Z into the equation, we get Z + Z + 2Z + 2Z + 4Z = 10.

Combine like terms: 10Z = 10.

Divide both sides by 10: Z = 1.

Now that we know Z = 1, we can find O. Since O = 4Z, O = 4(1) = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of the goats is 3 * $500 = $1500.
The cost of the cows is 2 * $1500 = $3000.

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Paul needs 63 cupcakes in total. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, so the total number of cupcakes he has is 8 + 40 = 48.

Now, let's subtract the number of cupcakes he has from the total number of cupcakes he needs: 63 - 48 = 15.

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars. So, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2. 40 * 0.2 = 8. So, Joe sells 8 cars.

3. Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

4. Now, let's find out how many cars Joe has left. He started with 40 cars, sold 8, and gave away 16. So, he has 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars left.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to first determine the total amount raised by the students. Since the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, the amount raised by the students is $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Now, we know that there are 20 students and they all raised the same amount. To find out how much each student raised, we divide the total amount raised by the number of students: $125,000 / 20 = $6,250.

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day, and then add them together.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time in minutes, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes
4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes

Now, we add the time from both days:
480 minutes + 240 minutes = 720 minutes

The final numerical answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to first determine the total number of cars in the parking lot when he got out of class for lunch.

Initially, Hunter counted 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, making the total 50 + 20 = 70 cars.

When he got out of class for lunch, 1/2 of the cars had left. This means that 1/2 of 70 cars had left, which is 70 / 2 = 35 cars.

So, the number of cars that remained in the parking lot when Hunter got out of class for lunch is 70 - 35 = 35 cars.

However, the question asks for the total number of cars he counted during the lunch break. Since 1/2 of the cars had left, the other half remained. Therefore, the total number of cars he counted during the lunch break is also 35.

The final answer is: 35"
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 different tasks. So, the total number of tasks he completes in a day is:
30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day

Since each task pays $1.20, the total amount John makes in a day is:
150 tasks/day * $1.20/task = $180/day

John works a full 7-day week, so the total amount he makes in a week is:
$180/day * 7 days = $1260

"To find the total points scored by Sasha, we need to calculate her points in both games. 

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game. 

So, in the second game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points.

To find the total points scored by Sasha, we add her points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18.

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as 'x'. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. We can write the equation as x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341.

Combine like terms: 7x + 12 = 341.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329.

Divide both sides by 7: x = 47.

Since PJ has x cards, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has 3x cards, so Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards. Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has 3 * 47 + 12 = 147 cards.

"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of eggs of each color and then add them together.

Cindy had 5 green eggs. 
She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.
She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

"To calculate the total cost of shipping, we need to calculate the cost per pound and the cost per mile, then multiply them by their respective weights and distances. 

The cost per pound is $0.35, and the book weighs 4 pounds, so the cost for the weight is 4 * $0.35 = $1.40. 

The cost per mile is $0.08, and the book needs to be returned 20 miles away, so the cost for the distance is 20 * $0.08 = $1.60.

The total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $2.00.

The book's purchase price is $32, and Amazon will only refund 75% of it, so the refund amount is 0.75 * $32 = $24.

The total amount Milly will lose is the shipping cost minus the refund amount, which is $2.00 - $24 = -$22.00. However, since we can't lose a negative amount of money, we need to recalculate the total loss by considering the refund as a positive value and the shipping cost as a negative value. 

The total loss is $24 - $2.00 = $22.00.

The final answer is: $22.00"

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for the first three weeks and then determine the pattern.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.
In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, we can find out how much he produces in the fourth week by subtracting the production of the first three weeks from the total production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on TikTok in a week and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on TikTok in a week:

- She records 18 videos, each taking 4 minutes. So, the total time spent recording videos is 18 * 4 = 72 minutes.
- She spends 2 hours writing songs, which is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.
- She spends 15 minutes each day for 6 days on makeup, so the total time spent on makeup is 15 * 6 = 90 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time spent on TikTok in a week:
72 (recording) + 120 (writing songs) + 90 (makeup) = 282 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 282 minutes to hours:
282 / 60 = 4.7 hours

Now, let's multiply the time spent on TikTok in a week by 4 to find the time spent in a month:
4.7 hours/week * 4 weeks/month = 18.8 hours

"To calculate the total cost, we need to first determine the cost of the initial installation and then add the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. However, Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. Since the initial installation already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier, we only need to consider the additional items.

Angela has 2 extra mirrors (6 - 4 = 2), 1 extra chandelier (2 - 1 = 1), and 10 extra pictures (20 - 10 = 10). The cost of the initial installation is $129.00.

The cost of the additional items is $15.00 per item. So, the total cost of the additional items is:
2 (mirrors) + 1 (chandelier) + 10 (pictures) = 13 items
13 items * $15.00 per item = $195.00

Now, we add the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items:
$129.00 (initial installation) + $195.00 (additional items) = $324.00

The final answer is: $324.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money Anthony has saved, and then calculate 40% more than that amount.

First, we know that Eva has saved $20.00. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Since Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, we need to find 40% of $30.00 and add it to $30.00. 

40% of $30.00 is 0.4 x $30.00 = $12.00. 

So, Roy has saved $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

The final answer is: $42.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain in relation to Pompei's lifting capacity. 

First, we know that Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, and Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. So, Saskay can lift a mountain 12 * 1 = 12 inches.

Next, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Finally, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 since there are 12 inches in a foot. 

480 / 12 = 40 feet.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the speed of the kangaroos. Since it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can assume that the total distance is the same for all animals. Let's call the speed of a kangaroo ""k"" and the distance ""d"". 

The time it takes for 3 kangaroos to travel the distance is given by the formula: time = distance / speed. Since there are 3 kangaroos, the total speed is 3k. So, we have:

18 = d / (3k)

Now, we can rearrange the equation to find the distance: d = 18 * 3k = 54k.

Next, we need to find the speed of the turtles. Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, their speed is k/2.

Now, we can use the same formula to find the time it takes for the turtles to travel the distance: time = distance / speed. The distance is still 54k, and the speed of the turtles is k/2. So, we have:

time = 54k / (k/2) = 54k * 2 / k = 108 hours.

The final answer is: 108"

"Let's break down the information given. Erika's goal is to buy a laptop that costs $600. She gets a discount of $200 for trading in her old laptop, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.

She already has some savings in her purse, let's call it x. She also earned $150 from her part-time job and received $80 from her mom. So, the total amount of money she has is x + $150 + $80.

We know that after getting this total amount, she only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop. This means the total amount she has is $400 (the price of the laptop after the discount) + $50 (the amount she still needs) = $450.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the situation: x + $150 + $80 = $450. 

To find the value of x, we need to subtract $230 from both sides of the equation: x = $450 - $230.

x = $220.

So, Erika has $220 in her purse. 

The final answer is: $220"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of apple slices Adam has initially and then subtract the number of slices he eats.

First, let's calculate the total number of slices from the large apples. Since each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, 3 large apples will give us 3 * 5 = 15 slices.

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices from the small apples. Since each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, 5 small apples will give us 5 * 3 = 15 slices.

Now, we add the total number of slices from the large and small apples: 15 (from large apples) + 15 (from small apples) = 30 slices.

Adam eats 15 slices, so we subtract this from the total number of slices: 30 - 15 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the total amount of milk the farmer currently produces. 

The farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each cow, and he has 3 cows. So, the total amount of milk he currently produces is 5 liters/cow * 3 cows = 15 liters/day.

To find out how many more cows he needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we subtract the current production from the target production: 25 liters/day - 15 liters/day = 10 liters/day.

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we need to find out how many cows are needed to produce 10 liters of milk a day. We can do this by dividing the target production by the amount of milk each cow produces: 10 liters/day / 5 liters/cow = 2 cows.

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the length of each used portion and subtract it from the original length of the glue stick.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so the used portion is 1 - 1/6 = 5/6. The length of the used portion is 5/6 * 12 mm = 10 mm.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so the used portion is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. The length of the used portion is 1/3 * 12 mm = 4 mm.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so the used portion is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. The length of the used portion is 1/2 * 12 mm = 6 mm.

Now, let's calculate the total length of the used portions: 10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm.

The total length of the glue sticks is 3 * 12 mm = 36 mm.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 36 mm - 20 mm = 16 mm.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy and subtract the amount of money he already has.

The total cost of the items is $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10080.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200, so he has a total of $5000 + $200 = $5200.

Now, let's subtract the amount of money Gabriel has from the total cost of the items: $10080 - $5200 = $3580.

So, Gabriel still needs $3580 to buy the car and the phone.

The final answer is: $3580"
"To find the change, we need to calculate the total amount Thea paid and subtract it from the amount she gave the craftsman. 

First, let's find the total amount Thea paid: 4 * $20 = $80.

"To find out how much money Craig has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract that from the initial amount he had.

Craig initially had 2 twenty-dollar bills, which is 2 * $20 = $40.

He bought 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so the total cost of the squirt guns is 6 * $2 = $12.

He also bought 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so the total cost of the water balloons is 3 * $3 = $9.

The total amount he spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

Craig has $19 left.

The final answer is: $19"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. Since Jack has an unknown number of socks, let's call it 'x'. Then, Peter has 2x socks.
4. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so the number of socks Jack has is 60 / 2 = 30.
5. Now we know that Peter has 2x socks and Jack has 30 socks. Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can set up the equation 2x = 30. Solving for x, we get x = 15.
6. So, Jack has 30 socks and Peter has 2x = 2 * 15 = 30 socks.
7. The total number of socks is 30 (Jack's socks) + 30 (Peter's socks) = 60 socks.
8. The total number of dishes is 30 (Peter's dishes) + 60 (Jack's dishes) = 90 dishes.

The total number of socks and dishes together is 60 + 90 = 150."
"To find the number of students good at math, we need to consider the total number of students and the number of students good at both subjects. 

Let's denote the number of students good at both math and English as x. We know that the total number of students is 20, and the number of students good at math only is 5, and the number of students good at English only is 8.

We can set up the equation: 5 (math only) + 8 (English only) + x (both) = 20 (total)

Simplifying the equation, we get: 13 + x = 20

Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get: x = 7

This means that 7 students are good at both math and English. To find the total number of students good at math, we need to add the number of students good at math only (5) and the number of students good at both subjects (7).

Total number of students good at math = 5 (math only) + 7 (both) = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total time available for performances, we need to subtract the intermission time from the total concert time. 

Total concert time = 2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes
Intermission time = 10 minutes
Time available for performances = Total concert time - Intermission time = 120 - 10 = 110 minutes

Each group takes 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage. So, the total time taken by each group = 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes.

Now, we can find the number of groups that can perform in the given time by dividing the time available for performances by the time taken by each group.

Number of groups = Time available for performances / Time taken by each group = 110 / 10 = 11

The final answer is: 11"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand that it's a simple interest scenario. The interest rate is 3/4 of the original amount per year, which can be expressed as 0.75 or 75% of the principal amount.

The formula for simple interest is: A = P(1 + rt), where A is the total amount, P is the principal amount, r is the interest rate, and t is the time period in years.

Given that the principal amount (P) is $300, the interest rate (r) is 0.75, and the time period (t) is 3 years, we can plug these values into the formula:

A = 300(1 + 0.75*3)
A = 300(1 + 2.25)
A = 300(3.25)
A = 975

So, after 3 years, Brenda will have a total of $975.

The final answer is: $975"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of white shirts with no collars and the number of floral shirts with no buttons.

First, let's find the number of white shirts with collars. Since half of the white shirts have collars, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of white shirts with collars = Total number of white shirts / 2
= 40 / 2
= 20

Now, let's find the number of white shirts with no collars:
Number of white shirts with no collars = Total number of white shirts - Number of white shirts with collars
= 40 - 20
= 20

Next, let's find the number of floral shirts with buttons:
Number of floral shirts with buttons = 20

Now, let's find the total number of floral shirts:
Total number of floral shirts = 50

To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we subtract the number of floral shirts with buttons from the total number of floral shirts:
Number of floral shirts with no buttons = Total number of floral shirts - Number of floral shirts with buttons
= 50 - 20
= 30

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars:
Difference = Number of floral shirts with no buttons - Number of white shirts with no collars
= 30 - 20
= 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much the farmer will earn, we need to determine how many trays he can fill with 900 eggs. 

Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray to find the number of trays.

Number of trays = Total eggs / Eggs per tray
= 900 / 30
= 30 trays

Now, we know the farmer has 30 trays. To find out how much he will earn, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray.

Earnings = Number of trays * Price per tray
= 30 * $2.5
= $75

"To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we first need to determine the number of goats sold from each farm. 

From Farm X, Mr. Smith sold 10 goats. 
From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as from Farm X, which is 2 * 10 = 20 goats.

Now, let's calculate the number of goats left in each farm. 
In Farm X, Mr. Smith had 55 goats initially and sold 10, so he has 55 - 10 = 45 goats left.
In Farm Y, Mr. Smith had 45 goats initially and sold 20, so he has 45 - 20 = 25 goats left.

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the number of goats left in each farm: 45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount spent on shoes per year by the number of pairs bought per year.

First, let's calculate the number of pairs James buys per year. Since he buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, and there are 12 months in a year, he buys 2 * 12 = 24 pairs of shoes per year.

Now, let's divide the total amount spent on shoes per year ($2640) by the number of pairs bought per year (24):

$2640 Ã· 24 = $110

So, James pays an average of $110 per pair of shoes."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food, then subtract the discount for the red baskets.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $18 = $54.

The total cost before discount is $75 + $54 = $129.

Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, the total discount is 3 * $2 = $6.

The total cost after discount is $129 - $6 = $123.

The final numerical answer is: $123"
"To find the time it takes to clean one-half of the rooms, we first need to determine the number of rooms that is half of 90. 

90 / 2 = 45 rooms

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room.

45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built each year and then add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years, which is 12 + 36 = 48 homes. Then, they will double this amount, so 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's add the number of homes built each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. I am three years younger than my brother, so if we denote my age as 'x', my brother's age is 'x + 3'.
2. I am 2 years older than my sister, so my sister's age is 'x - 2'.
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so my mom's age is '3(x + 3) - 1'.
4. When you add all our ages, you get 87. So, the equation becomes: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Now, let's simplify the equation:
x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87
Combine like terms:
6x + 9 = 87
Subtract 9 from both sides:
6x = 78
Divide both sides by 6:
x = 13

So, I am 13 years old.

"To find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of glue sticks required. Since each student needs 2 glue sticks and there are 27 students, the total number of glue sticks needed is 27 * 2 = 54.

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by the number of glue sticks per pack to find out how many packs are needed. However, since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and expects to have some extra glue sticks left over, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

To do this, we can divide 54 by 8, which gives us 6.75. Since we can't buy a fraction of a pack, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 7.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at the given point over the three days.

On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point over the three days, we need to add the amounts from each day: 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000 gallons.

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 24000 gallons.

The final answer is: 24000"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. Since each infected person infects six others, we can model the growth of the infected population using a geometric progression.

Let's denote the initial number of infected people as P0 = 10. The number of new infections each day can be calculated as 6 times the number of infected people from the previous day.

Day 1: P1 = P0 + 6P0 = 10 + 6(10) = 10 + 60 = 70
Day 2: P2 = P1 + 6P1 = 70 + 6(70) = 70 + 420 = 490
Day 3: P3 = P2 + 6P2 = 490 + 6(490) = 490 + 2940 = 3430

Therefore, the total number of people infected after three days is 3430.

The final answer is: 3430"
"To find out how much money Julieta received, we need to calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips and subtract it from Rafaela's total tips. 

Rafaela received $20 from each of the 40 customers, so her total tips are 40 * $20 = $800.

10% of $800 is 0.1 * $800 = $80. 

Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela, so she received $800 - $80 = $720.

To find the total amount of money they received altogether, we add their tips together: $800 + $720 = $1520.

The final answer is: $1520"
"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to calculate the total number of oranges given to her children and subtract that from the initial number of oranges she bought.

First, let's calculate the total number of oranges given to her daughters: 3 daughters * 2 oranges per daughter = 6 oranges.

Then, add the number of oranges given to her son: 6 oranges + 3 oranges = 9 oranges.

Now, subtract the total number of oranges given to her children from the initial number of oranges: 12 oranges - 9 oranges = 3 oranges.

So, Jennifer remained with 3 oranges.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Claire earns 1 badge per month.
- Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.
- Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), the number of badges earned by each person would be:
- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 0.5 badges/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:
36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices she baked and sold. 

First, let's find out how many hours she baked. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours.

Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, she baked 2 * 5 = 10 loaves in 5 hours.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she baked 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, and she sold all 80 slices. To find the total amount raised, we need to convert the cents to dollars. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so 50 cents is 0.5 dollars.

Now, we multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 * 0.5 = 40 dollars.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we first need to determine the number of silver coins she has. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, and she has 70 gold coins, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship.

Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Then, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'. We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 70

To solve for 'x', we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

x = 70 - 30
x = 40

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. To find the total number of coins, we add the number of silver coins to the number of gold coins:

Total coins = Number of silver coins + Number of gold coins
Total coins = 40 + 70
Total coins = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we first need to determine the total number of burritos consumed. 

There were 50 students at the picnic, and each student was given 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Mr. George also ate 20 burritos. 

The total number of burritos consumed is 500 (given to students) + 20 (eaten by Mr. George) = 520.

Since there were 600 burritos ordered initially, the total number of leftover burritos is 600 - 520 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the number of yellow cars, we first need to determine the number of green, blue, and red cars. 

We know there are 12 red cars. The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we know the total number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 + 10 + 30 = 52.

Since the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23.

"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S.

We are given that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so we can write this as S = A + 25.

We are also given that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so we can write this as A = F - 12.

Now, we are told that together, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books. This can be written as S + A + F = 85.

Substituting the first two equations into the third, we get (A + 25) + A + F = 85. Simplifying this, we get 2A + F + 25 = 85.

We can rewrite this as 2A + F = 60.

Now, we substitute A = F - 12 into the equation 2A + F = 60. This gives us 2(F - 12) + F = 60.

Expanding this, we get 2F - 24 + F = 60.

Combining like terms, we get 3F - 24 = 60.

Adding 24 to both sides, we get 3F = 84.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get F = 28.

"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to determine how much Keenan spends in a month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

First, let's calculate Keenan's monthly expenditure: 
Total monthly expenditure = $400
Madeline's share = 60% of $400 = 0.6 * $400 = $240
Keenan's share = Total monthly expenditure - Madeline's share = $400 - $240 = $160

Since we are given that the month is four weeks long, we can now calculate Keenan's weekly expenditure:
Keenan's monthly expenditure = $160
Number of weeks in a month = 4
Keenan's weekly expenditure = Keenan's monthly expenditure / Number of weeks in a month = $160 / 4 = $40

"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he ate on each day and add them up.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and divide by 5:
60 * 2 = 120
120 / 5 = 24

So, on the first day, he ate 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. To find the remaining pieces after the first two days, we subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26

Now, we need to find 7/13 of 26:
26 * 7 = 182
182 / 13 = 14.15 (round to 14 since we can't eat a fraction of a piece)

So, on the third day, he ate 14 pieces.

Now, let's add up the pieces eaten on each day:
24 (first day) + 10 (second day) + 14 (third day) = 48

"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we first need to determine the cost per bottle of soda and the cost per bottle of water.

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so the cost per bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00 per bottle.

The cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the cost per bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00 per bottle.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:

Cost of 3 bottles of soda = 3 * $3.00 = $9.00
Cost of 2 bottles of water = 2 * $2.00 = $4.00

Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours of dog walking at the same rate, we need to first determine her hourly rate. 

We know that Ella earned $33 for 3 hours of dog walking. To find her hourly rate, we can divide the total amount earned by the number of hours worked.

Hourly rate = Total amount earned / Number of hours worked
Hourly rate = $33 / 3 hours
Hourly rate = $11 per hour

Now that we know her hourly rate, we can calculate how much she would earn after 12 hours of dog walking.

Total earnings after 12 hours = Hourly rate * Number of hours worked

"To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Paul has 52 marbles. His friend gave him 28 marbles, so now he has 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.

Then, he lost 1/4 of his marbles. To find 1/4 of 80, we multiply 80 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing 80 by 4. 

80 / 4 = 20

So, Paul lost 20 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has left, we subtract 20 from 80.

80 - 20 = 60

Therefore, Paul has 60 marbles left.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points she gets from each type of question and add them together.

First, let's calculate the points from the multiple-choice questions. Amy correctly answers 80% of the 10 multiple-choice questions, so she gets 0.8 * 10 = 8 points from the multiple-choice questions.

Next, let's calculate the points from the true/false questions. Amy correctly answers 90% of the 20 true/false questions, so she gets 0.9 * 20 = 18 points from the true/false questions.

Now, let's calculate the points from the long-answer questions. Amy correctly answers 60% of the 5 long-answer questions, so she gets 0.6 * 5 = 3 points from the long-answer questions.

Finally, we multiply the points from each type of question by their respective point values and add them together. The multiple-choice questions are worth 1 point each, the true/false questions are worth 1 point each, and the long-answer questions are worth 5 points each.

So, Amy gets 8 * 1 = 8 points from the multiple-choice questions, 18 * 1 = 18 points from the true/false questions, and 3 * 5 = 15 points from the long-answer questions.

Adding these together, Amy's total score is 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 points.

The final answer is: 41"
"To find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we first need to determine how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them, we can calculate the number of chickens he plans to sell as follows:

Number of chickens to sell = 300 * (3/5)
= 300 * 0.6
= 180 chickens

Next, we know that Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000 by selling these chickens at $50 each. To find the total revenue, we multiply the number of chickens by the selling price:

Total revenue = Number of chickens to sell * Selling price
= 180 * $50
= $9000

Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, we can set up the equation:

Total revenue - Total cost = Profit
$9000 - Total cost = $2000

To find the total cost, we subtract the profit from the total revenue:

Total cost = Total revenue - Profit
= $9000 - $2000
= $7000

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"
"To find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 2, since they sold an equal number. 

Total glasses sold = 32
Number of people who sold an equal number of glasses = 2 (Micah and Mitchell)
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = Total glasses sold / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16

Since Julie sold 14 glasses, we can find out how many more glasses she sold than Micah by subtracting the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold.

Glasses sold by Julie = 14
Glasses sold by Micah = 16
Difference = Glasses sold by Julie - Glasses sold by Micah = 14 - 16 = -2

The final answer is: $\boxed{-2}$"
"To find the total amount Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the manicure. Since Iris spent 1/4 as much on the manicure as she did on her hair, and she spent $400 on her hair, the cost of the manicure is:

$400 * 1/4 = $100

Next, let's find the cost of the pedicure. Since Iris spent 3/4 as much on the pedicure as she did on her manicure, and she spent $100 on her manicure, the cost of the pedicure is:

$100 * 3/4 = $75

Now, let's add up the costs of all three services:

$400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575

The final answer is: $575"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate how much money Sarah will get from selling the rope to her friend. 

The rope is 20 meters long, and her friend wants to buy it for $2 a meter. So, the total amount of money Sarah will get is 20 * $2 = $40.

Next, we need to calculate how much money Sarah will spend on the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 a meter, and she wants to buy a rope of the same length, 20 meters. So, the total amount of money she will spend is 20 * $1.5 = $30.

To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to subtract the amount she spent from the amount she got. So, $40 - $30 = $10.

The final answer is: $10"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Melanie's current age. Since in 10 years, she will be 18 years old, we can subtract 10 from 18 to find her current age.

Current age = 18 - 10 = 8 years

Now, we need to find the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her current age. Let's call this number 'x'. We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

Current age + x = 3 * Current age

Substituting the value of current age, we get:

8 + x = 3 * 8

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8 + x = 24

Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get:

x = 16

So, it will take 16 years for Melanie's age to be thrice her current age.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's find the cost of the chicken. Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and the 5 packs of bacon cost $10, the cost of each pack of chicken is $10 / 5 = $2. Since Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost of the chicken is 6 * $2 = $12.

Next, let's find the cost of the strawberries. Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of the strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

Now, let's find the cost of the apples. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost of the apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart: $10 (bacon) + $12 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $48.

Finally, let's subtract the total cost of the items from Kelly's budget: $65 - $48 = $17.

The final answer is: $17"
"Let's break down the information given. Elaina's final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, and the total runtime of the final concert, including the encore, is 65 minutes. 

Let's denote the runtime of her usual concert as 'x'. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concert, its runtime would be 2x. Adding the 15-minute encore to the final concert, we get the total runtime as 2x + 15 = 65.

Now, we can solve for 'x' by subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to isolate 'x': x = 50 / 2
x = 25

So, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he initially had.

Initially, Argo had 200 toys. He gave away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. 

First, let's add up the number of toys he gave away: 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys.

Now, let's subtract the number of toys he gave away from the initial number of toys: 200 - 150 = 50.

So, Argo has 50 toys now.

"To find the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged, we first need to find the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs. 

Let's assume the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is 'x'. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is 2x.

However, we know that the singer has 50 microphones in total. Since 20% of the microphones won't find any space to fit in, the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is 80% of 50, which is 0.8 * 50 = 40.

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged is 40 / 2 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate the number of birds in each group and add them together.

First, let's find the number of birds nesting in the bushes: 6 birds.

Next, we need to find 2/3 of the number of birds nesting in the bushes. To do this, we multiply 6 by 2/3, which is the same as multiplying 6 by 2 and then dividing by 3. 

6 * 2 = 12
12 / 3 = 4

So, 2/3 of the number of birds nesting in the bushes is 4 birds. Since these birds are flying overhead, we add 4 to the number of birds nesting in the bushes: 6 + 4 = 10 birds.

Now, let's find the number of birds feeding. Jerry sees 3 groups of 8 birds each, so we multiply 3 by 8 to find the total number of birds feeding: 3 * 8 = 24 birds.

Finally, we add the number of birds nesting, flying, and feeding to find the total number of birds: 6 + 10 + 24 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to first determine how many cookies Lani had left after eating 5. 

Lani started with 55 cookies and ate 5, so she had 55 - 5 = 50 cookies left.

Since she placed the remaining cookies equally into 5 jars, we need to divide the remaining cookies by 5.

50 Ã· 5 = 10

So, there were 10 cookies in each jar.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of petals on the orchids, we multiply the number of orchids by the number of petals per orchid: 5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals.

To find the total number of petals on the daisies, we multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals.

Now, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies to find the difference: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

The daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids.

"To find the percentage of flowering plants, we first need to determine the number of flowering plants. 

There are 100 plants in total. One-fourth of them are indoor plants, which is 100 * 1/4 = 25 plants. 

The remaining plants are 100 - 25 = 75 plants. Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants, which is 75 * 2/3 = 50 plants. 

The rest of the remaining plants are flowering plants, which is 75 - 50 = 25 plants.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25 / 100) * 100 = 25%.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to determine the speed of the thingamabob first. Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can find the speed of the thingamabob by dividing the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11.

Speed of thingamabob = Speed of whatchamacallit / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig by multiplying the speed of the thingamabob by 5.

Speed of whirligig = Speed of thingamabob * 5
Speed of whirligig = 11 * 5
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the price of one carrot as 'c'. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, the price of the yogurt is $6 / 2 = $3.

Ellen eats two carrots every day, so the total cost of carrots is 2c.

The total cost of the salad and the yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.

Since Ellen pays a total of $11 for her goods, the cost of the carrots can be found by subtracting the cost of the salad and the yogurt from the total cost: 2c = $11 - $9 = $2.

To find the price of one carrot, we divide the total cost of carrots by 2: c = $2 / 2 = $1.

"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark used to make $10 an hour, but his pay was raised by $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we can multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week to find his weekly earnings: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Tasha made $80 in total from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. We also know that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work. 

Since we know the amount Joe paid, we can use this to find out how many lawns Tasha mowed for Joe. If Joe paid $6, then Tasha must have mowed 1 lawn for Joe (since 1 lawn is the only amount that would result in a whole number of dollars).

Now, let's consider the other lawns Tasha mowed. We know that she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she did Joe's, and Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's. Since Tasha mowed 1 lawn for Joe, she must have mowed 3 lawns for Kamala and 5 lawns for Alba.

In total, Tasha mowed 1 (for Joe) + 3 (for Kamala) + 5 (for Alba) = 9 lawns. We know that Tasha made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, so she made a total of $6 * 9 = $54 from mowing lawns.

Since Tasha made $80 in total and $54 from mowing lawns, she must have made $80 - $54 = $26 from selling lemonade.

"To find the total amount John earns from renting his car, we need to calculate the total hours he rents his car and multiply it by his hourly rate.

He rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so the total hours he rents his car is 10 * 3 = 30 hours.

His hourly rate is $25, so the total amount he earns is 30 * $25 = $750.

However, he has a car payment of $500, so we need to subtract this from his total earnings to find the profit.

Profit = Total earnings - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500
Profit = $250

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Martha initially had an unknown number of notebooks, but we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha. If we denote Martha's initial number of notebooks as 'x', then Joseph had 3x notebooks.

After buying 5 more notebooks, Martha now has a total of 7 notebooks. This means that her initial number of notebooks (x) plus the 5 notebooks she bought equals 7. So, we can write the equation as x + 5 = 7.

To find the value of x, we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation: x = 7 - 5, which gives us x = 2. 

Now that we know Martha initially had 2 notebooks, we can find out how many notebooks Joseph had. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

The question asks how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph now. Since Martha has 7 notebooks and Joseph has 6 notebooks, the difference is 7 - 6 = 1.

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find 1/5 of Dijana's distance, we multiply 50 by 1/5, which is 10 miles. 

So, Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles. 

Now, to find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we add their individual distances: 50 (Dijana) + 60 (Anis) = 110 miles.

Initially, Susan had 100 cookies. Her husband took 4 cookies, so we subtract 4 from 100 to get the remaining number of cookies: 100 - 4 = 96.

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews, which is 6. To do this, we'll divide 96 by 6.

96 Ã· 6 = 16

So, each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies."
"To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more than as many pages as Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 5 + 13 = 18 pages today.

So, Denise's total pages read is 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.

Daniel's total pages read is 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages.

The difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel is 28 - 13 = 15.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bowls of soup will be used for dinner and then find out how many bowls of soup will be left over. 

For dinner, there are 3 adults and 2 children, so a total of 5 people. Since each person eats one bowl, 5 bowls will be used for dinner. 

The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls, so it can fill 4 + 4 = 8 bowls in total. 

Since 5 bowls will be used for dinner, there will be 8 - 5 = 3 bowls left over. 

The leftover soup can fill 8 child bowls, so each child can have a bowl of soup 3 / 2 = 1.5 times. However, since you can't have a fraction of a bowl, we'll round down to 1 time."

"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to calculate the total amount of material required for the small and large masks separately and then add them together.

For small masks, Jo needs 2 yards of material to make 4 masks. To find out how much material is needed for 20 small masks, we can multiply the amount of material needed for 4 masks by 5 (20/4 = 5). 

2 yards * 5 = 10 yards for 20 small masks.

For large masks, Jo needs 2.25 yards of material to make 3 masks. To find out how much material is needed for 8 large masks, we can multiply the amount of material needed for 3 masks by 2.67 (8/3 = 2.67, rounded to two decimal places).

2.25 yards * 2.67 = 6.0075 yards for 8 large masks.

Now, we add the material needed for small and large masks together.

10 yards + 6.0075 yards = 16.0075 yards.

So, Jo would need approximately 16.01 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks for her class.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write an equation:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 2 * Adam's age four years ago
Duncan's age eight years ago = 2x

We know that Duncan's current age is 60, so we can find his age eight years ago by subtracting 8 from 60:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 60 - 8
Duncan's age eight years ago = 52

Now we can equate this to 2x:

52 = 2x

To find x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 52 / 2
x = 26

This means Adam's age four years ago was 26. To find Adam's current age, we add 4 to x:

Adam's current age = x + 4
Adam's current age = 26 + 4
Adam's current age = 30

Finally, to find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = Adam's current age + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 38

Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and there are 20 red balloons, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

Now, we know that Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna at the balloons. To find out how many were thrown at the yellow balloons, we subtract the number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons from the total: 58 - 40 = 18.

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we can find the number of yellow balloons by dividing the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons by 3: 18 / 3 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in 30 days and then divide that by the miles required for a tune-up.

Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so the total miles driven is:
100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find the number of tune-ups needed:
3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total hours Bruce works in the three days, we need to calculate the hours he works each day and then add them up.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, which is 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours he works each day: 5 (Tuesday) + 10 (Wednesday) + 8 (Thursday) = 23 hours.

The final answer is: 23"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of money Julia and Nadine had, and then divide it by 2 to find out how much each of them received as allowance.

First, let's find the cost of the balloons. 1 dozen balloons is equal to 12 balloons. Since 2 balloons cost $0.5, 12 balloons will cost 12 * $0.5 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of the cake and the balloons is $11 + $3 = $14.

The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is $7 * 2 = $14.

The total cost of the cake, balloons, and ice cream is $14 + $14 = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine used all the money they had to buy these items, the total amount of money they had is $28.

Since they had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount of money by 2 to find out how much each of them received. 

$28 / 2 = $14

The final answer is: $14"

"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer, and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of students playing tennis. There are 6 students playing tennis, and twice that number playing volleyball, so the number of students playing volleyball is 6 * 2 = 12.

Next, we add the number of students playing tennis and volleyball: 6 + 12 = 18.

Now, we add the number of students playing soccer: 18 + 16 (boys) + 22 (girls) = 18 + 38 = 56.

The total number of students is 56.

"To find the total profit made by the class, we need to first find the total revenue and the total cost.

The total number of lollipops sold by each student is 10, and there are 30 students. So, the total number of lollipops sold is 10 * 30 = 300.

The selling price of each lollipop is $0.8, so the total revenue is 300 * $0.8 = $240.

The cost of each lollipop is $0.5, so the total cost is 300 * $0.5 = $150.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost, which is $240 - $150 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and add them up.

Larry has 3 cats.

He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

To find the total number of pets, we add up the number of each type of pet: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

The final answer is: 47"
"To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to determine how many slices each person eats per day and then calculate the total number of slices they eat together per day.

Abby eats 2 slices a day. 
Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 * 2 = 4 slices a day.

Together, they eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices a day.

The loaf of bread has 24 slices. To find out how many days it will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat per day: 24 / 6 = 4.

"To find out how many shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the total number of shells she collected from the age of 5 to 10.

Since Martha collects one shell every month, and there are 12 months in a year, we can calculate the number of shells she collected in each year. 

From age 5 to 6, Martha collected 12 shells (1 shell/month * 12 months).
From age 6 to 7, Martha collected 12 shells (1 shell/month * 12 months).
From age 7 to 8, Martha collected 12 shells (1 shell/month * 12 months).
From age 8 to 9, Martha collected 12 shells (1 shell/month * 12 months).
From age 9 to 10, Martha collected 12 shells (1 shell/month * 12 months).

Now, let's add up the total number of shells collected in each year:
12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 = 60

So, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected 60 shells.

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cups of tea are in each row. Since Lana divides the 27 cups into 3 rows, we can divide 27 by 3 to get the number of cups in each row.

27 cups / 3 rows = 9 cups per row

Since Lana creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row will be half of the total cups in each row.

9 cups per row / 2 = 4.5 cups of mint tea per row

However, since we can't have a fraction of a cup, we can assume that Lana will make whole cups of tea. This means that she will make 4 cups of mint tea in each row and 5 cups of chamomile tea in each row, as the total number of cups in each row is 9.

4 cups of mint tea per row"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip. 

Let's break down the information given:

- The sloth takes 4 hours to make a round trip (down and back up) to collect berries.
- The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

Since the sloth takes 4 hours for a round trip, in 8 hours, he can make 8 / 4 = 2 round trips.

If he makes 2 round trips, he will collect a total of 2 * x berries, where x is the number of berries he picks up per trip.

We want to find the minimum value of x such that 2 * x = 24.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 12.

So, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the amount of water in the tank. Since Anthony and his father fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool, we can calculate this as follows:

10000 gallons (pool) / 2 = 5000 gallons (tank)

Next, we need to find out how much water is used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so we can multiply this rate by the number of days:

500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons

Now, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount in the tank to find the remaining water:

5000 gallons (initial) - 3000 gallons (used) = 2000 gallons

The final answer is: 2000"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much money Colby has left and then determine how many movies he can see with the remaining money.

Colby's initial budget is $150. He has already spent money on:

- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total money spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Colby has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Each movie costs $10, and he wants to buy a popcorn ($8) and a box of candy ($2) for the last movie. So, the cost for the last movie will be $10 + $8 + $2 = $20.

Colby can see 1 more movie with the remaining money.

"To find the total calories of the pastries, we first need to calculate the calories of each type of mini pastry. 

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories. 

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, we can calculate the total calories of each type of pastry. 
200 mini cinnamon rolls have 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.
300 mini blueberry muffins have 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

The total calories of all the pastries are 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

On Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Tuesday, so 2 * 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378

There are 5 days in total. 

Average number of Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days

"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled and then find the difference between the two distances.

The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. To find the distance traveled by the bus, we multiply the speed by the time: 60 miles/hour * 5 hours = 300 miles.

The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. To find the distance traveled by the car, we multiply the speed by the time: 30 miles/hour * 8 hours = 240 miles.

Now, we need to find the difference between the distance traveled by the bus and the car: 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles.

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car.

"Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as p, and John's age as j. We are given the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old. This can be written as P + p + j = 100.
2. Paul is 10 years older than John, which can be written as p = j + 10.
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, which can be written as P = p + j.

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to get P = (j + 10) + j, which simplifies to P = 2j + 10.

Now, we can substitute the expression for P into the first equation: (2j + 10) + p + j = 100.

We can substitute the second equation into this expression to get (2j + 10) + (j + 10) + j = 100.

This simplifies to 4j + 20 = 100.

Subtracting 20 from both sides gives us 4j = 80.

Dividing both sides by 4 gives us j = 20.

Now that we know John's age, we can find Paul's age by substituting j into the second equation: p = j + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30.

Finally, we can find Peter's age by substituting p into the third equation: P = p + j = 30 + 20 = 50.

"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria had 1 water balloon, and each of her 4 friends had 2 water balloons. So, the total number of balloons initially is:
1 (Maria's balloon) + (4 friends * 2 balloons per friend) = 1 + 8 = 9 balloons

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is:
5 people * 3 balloons per person = 15 balloons

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons:
9 (initial balloons) + 15 (additional balloons) = 24 balloons

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so they have 10 * 5 = 50 boxes from donations. 
They already have 10 boxes, so in total, they have 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, they will need 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

However, they already own 15 tables. To find out how many more tables they need, we subtract the number of tables they have from the total number of tables needed: 30 - 15 = 15.

So, they need 15 new tables.

"To find the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance spat by each person and then divide it by the total number of seeds spat.

Zoey spits 40 seeds, each 10 feet, so the total distance spat by Zoey is 40 * 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney spits 35 seeds, each 12 feet, so the total distance spat by Sydney is 35 * 12 = 420 feet.

The total number of seeds spat is 40 (Zoey) + 35 (Sydney) = 75 seeds.

The total distance spat is 400 (Zoey) + 420 (Sydney) = 820 feet.

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance spat by the total number of seeds spat: 820 / 75 = 10.93 feet.

"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to calculate the amount each sheep needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Twice the amount each goat needs: 2 * 5 = 10 pounds
3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs: 10 - 3 = 7 pounds

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep separately:

For goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds
For sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

To find the total amount of hay needed, we add the amount needed for the goats and sheep:

First, let's find the time it takes James to swim 60% of the distance. The total distance is 20 miles, and 60% of that is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. 

Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time it takes him to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

After swimming, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, let's find the remaining distance. The total distance is 20 miles, and James has already swum 12 miles, so the remaining distance is 20 - 12 = 8 miles.

James then swims the remaining distance at half his original speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. The time it takes him to swim the remaining 8 miles is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

The total time it takes James to get across the lake is the sum of the swimming time, the resting time, and the time it takes to swim the remaining distance: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Bahati and Dinar. 

Let's denote the points scored by Dinar as x. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati's points can be represented as x + 10. 

We know that Azibo scored 20 more points than Bahati, so Azibo's points can be represented as (x + 10) + 20 = x + 30.

The total points scored by the team is 45, which is the sum of the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + (x + 10) + (x + 30) = 45.

Combine like terms: 3x + 40 = 45.

Subtract 40 from both sides: 3x = 5.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 5/3.

However, x represents the points scored by Dinar, which cannot be a fraction. This indicates that the initial assumption of x being the points scored by Dinar is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Let's denote the points scored by Dinar as x. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so Bahati's points can be represented as x + 10. Azibo scored 20 more points than Bahati, so Azibo's points can be represented as (x + 10) + 20 = x + 30.

The total points scored by the team is 45, which is the sum of the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + (x + 10) + (x + 30) = 45.

Combine like terms: 3x + 40 = 45.

Subtract 40 from both sides: 3x = 5.

"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book in inches.

Since each paper is 100 pages to the inch and each paper is printed on both sides, we have 200 pages per inch (100 pages per side).

Given that the book is 1.5 inches thick, we can multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book:

200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 300 pages

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total time he spent stapling reports and then multiply it by his stapling rate.

First, let's find the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He stapled from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 15 hours by 60 to get the total minutes:
15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many sets of 15 minutes are in 900 minutes, we divide 900 by 15:
900 minutes / 15 minutes = 60 sets

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we multiply the number of sets by his stapling rate:
60 sets * 30 reports/set = 1800 reports

So, Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether.

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m., which is a total of 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she usually sleeps for 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, that day she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m. This means she slept from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m., which is a total of 7 hours and 55 minutes. Converting this to minutes, we get 7 * 60 + 55 = 455 minutes.

Now, we need to subtract the time she was sleepwalking, which was from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. This is a total of 23 minutes.

So, the total time she slept on her bed that day is 455 - 23 = 432 minutes.

The final answer is: 432"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons.

Two dozen cups is equal to 2 x 12 = 24 cups.

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we can multiply the number of cups by 2/3 to find the number of measuring spoons:

24 cups * (2/3) = 16 measuring spoons

Now, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so we need to subtract 6 from the initial number of measuring spoons:

16 measuring spoons - 6 measuring spoons = 10 measuring spoons

Jonathan has 2 dozen cups, which is 24 cups. To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we add the number of measuring spoons to the number of cups:

24 cups + 10 measuring spoons = 34 utensils

The final numerical answer is: 34"
"To find the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we first need to calculate the number of occupied beds and then subtract that from the total capacity.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied. 

1/5 of 1000 is 100. So, the number of occupied beds is 100.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we need to calculate the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 14 days.

The total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks is 50 * 14 = 700.

Now, we add the initial occupied beds to the total number of patients admitted: 100 + 700 = 800.

The number of unoccupied beds is the total capacity minus the occupied beds: 1000 - 800 = 200.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we first need to determine the number of non-work emails she sends. 

She sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to her family. Two-thirds of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6. This means she sends 6 emails to her family.

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after sending to her family. Since she sends 6 emails to her family, the remaining emails are 9 - 6 = 3.

One-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend. One-third of 3 is (1/3) * 3 = 1.

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

"To solve this problem, we need to find Shawna's age first, and then use that to find her father's age.

Since Aliya is 3 years old, and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we can calculate Shawna's age as follows:
Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9

Now that we know Shawna's age, we can find her father's age, which is five times Shawna's age:
Father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Father's age = 5 * 9
Father's age = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from the number she reported.

Let's assume the number Courtney reported is 100%. Since she overstated the number by 20%, the actual number is 80% of the number she reported.

First, we need to find 20% of 48. To do this, we multiply 48 by 0.2 (which is the decimal equivalent of 20%).

20% of 48 = 48 * 0.2 = 9.6

Now, we subtract 9.6 from 48 to find the actual number of people who attended the concert.

Actual number of people = 48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is: 38.4"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that Jason carried 2 balls, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. This means Jeffrey carried half the number of balls Jason carried, which is 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them: 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

However, this is the number of balls the boys carried, not the total number of balls the coach brought to practice. Since the boys carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is equal to the number of balls the boys carried.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many holes the pirates dug in total by the end of the third day, and then determine how many holes they dug on the fourth day.

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes on the third day. So, the total number of holes at the end of the third day is:

10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is:

10 * 4 = 40

Since there were 29 holes at the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:

40 - 29 = 11

So, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and the third person got 15 more than each of them. 

Let's denote the number of corn chips the third person got as x. Since the third person got 15 more than Amora and Lainey, we can write an equation:

x = 70 + 15
x = 85

So, the third person got 85 corn chips. 

Now, we know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and the third person got 85 corn chips. To find the total number of corn chips, we add the number of corn chips each person got:

Total corn chips = 70 + 70 + 85
Total corn chips = 225

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the total cost of travel, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of supplies. 

First, let's find 50% of the cost of supplies. 50% of $400 is 0.5 * 400 = $200.

Now, we add this to the original cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel. $400 + $200 = $600.

"Let's denote the number of PokÃ©mon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as X. We are given the following information:

1. X = S + 5
2. S = 4A - 13
3. A + S + X = 339

We can substitute the first equation into the third equation to get:
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
Combine like terms:
2S + A + 5 = 339

Now, substitute the second equation into the above equation:
2(4A - 13) + A + 5 = 339
Expand the equation:
8A - 26 + A + 5 = 339
Combine like terms:
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide both sides by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

"To find the total number of episodes, we need to determine how many episodes there are in total. Since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, and each episode is 20 minutes long, we can set up an equation.

Let's denote the number of episodes as 'e'. Since there are half as many episodes as minutes per episode, we can write the equation as e = 20 / 2. 

Solving for 'e', we get e = 10. 

Now that we know there are 10 episodes, we can find the total time John will spend watching the show by multiplying the number of episodes by the length of each episode: 10 * 20 = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and then add it to the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the southerly direction for the first 10 hours:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours
Distance = 300 miles

Then, the bird flies towards the north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 36 miles

Since the bird is flying north, this distance is subtracted from the total southerly distance:
Total southerly distance = 300 miles - 36 miles
Total southerly distance = 264 miles

Finally, the bird flies towards the south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 110 miles

Since the bird is flying south, this distance is added to the total southerly distance:
Total distance = 264 miles + 110 miles
Total distance = 374 miles

Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies.

In total, Greta received 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

To find the number of brownies left over, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies received: 66 - 18 = 48.

"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to find the age of Nani's brother and sister first.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means her age is 75% of Nani's age. To find 75% of Nani's age, we multiply his age by 0.75: 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we have the ages of all three family members: Nani (8 years), his brother (16 years), and his sister (6 years). 

The total age of all three family members is 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time it takes for each type of stringing and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time for synthetic gut racquets: 3 racquets * 15 minutes per racquet = 45 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time for polyester string racquets: 5 racquets * 22 minutes per racquet = 110 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time for hybrid sets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes per racquet = 72 minutes.

Finally, we add the times together: 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes.

The final answer is: 227"
"To find the total cost of the phones, we need to calculate the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones.

The first two phones cost the full price of $600 each, so the total cost for the first two phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.

The remaining phones are 2 (for the kids and the wife), and each of these phones is half price, which is $600 / 2 = $300.

The total cost for the remaining phones is 2 * $300 = $600.

Now, we add the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones to get the total cost: $1200 + $600 = $1800.

The final answer is: $1800"
"To find the total number of players in both teams, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team by adding 7 to 13.

13 (Carlton's players) + 7 = 20

Now that we know Zeke's team has 20 players, we can find the total number of players in both teams by adding the number of players on each team.

20 (Zeke's players) + 13 (Carlton's players) = 33

The final answer is: 33"
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2l + 2w, where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the length (l) is 15 feet and the width (w) is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(15) + 2(10)
P = 30 + 20
P = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

50 feet * 2 slats/foot = 100 slats

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats for his fence.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we first need to determine how many oranges she had initially and then subtract the ones she kept and gave away.

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges. So, the total number of oranges she bought is 12 * 20 = 240.

She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each, which is a total of 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, she gave away 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

Now, she kept 1/4 of the oranges. To find out how many oranges that is, we need to calculate 1/4 of the total number of oranges she bought, which is 240. 

1/4 of 240 is 240 / 4 = 60. So, she kept 60 oranges.

Now, we subtract the oranges she kept and the ones she gave away from the total number of oranges she bought to find out how many she sold. 

240 (total oranges) - 60 (kept) - 80 (given away) = 100 oranges.

The final answer is: 100"
"To solve this problem, we need to know the number of states in the USA and India. The USA has 50 states. 

First, let's find half the number of states in the USA: 50 / 2 = 25.

Since India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we add 4 to 25: 25 + 4 = 29.

Now, we know India has 29 states. To find the total number of states in both countries together, we add the number of states in the USA and India: 50 + 29 = 79.

The final numerical answer is: 79"
"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books. 

The total cost of the books is the sum of the cost of the dictionary, the dinosaur book, and the children's cookbook. 

Total cost = $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, we need to subtract this from the total cost to find out how much more he needs to earn.

Amount needed to earn = Total cost - Amount saved = $39 - $14 = $25

Now, we can find out how many hours Tyler needs to work by dividing the amount he needs to earn by his hourly wage.

Hours needed to work = Amount needed to earn / Hourly wage = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more than Richard. This means Richard has 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.

Since the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert and Richard have 30 and 20 cherries respectively, Jerry must have 60 - (30 + 20) = 10 cherries.

Now, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. Robert has 30 cherries, and Jerry has 10 cherries. So, Robert has 30 - 10 = 20 more cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many boxes of gingerbread and apple pie Sunny sold on both Saturday and Sunday, and then calculate the total earnings.

Let's denote the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday as G and the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday as A.

We know that on Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread, so G = 10.

We also know that on Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, and on Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. This means that A = 15 - 4 = 11.

On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday is G + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for both days.

The total earnings from gingerbread on Saturday is 10 * $6 = $60.
The total earnings from apple pie on Saturday is 11 * $15 = $165.
The total earnings from gingerbread on Sunday is 15 * $6 = $90.
The total earnings from apple pie on Sunday is 15 * $15 = $225.

The total earnings for Saturday is $60 + $165 = $225.
The total earnings for Sunday is $90 + $225 = $315.

The total earnings for two days is $225 + $315 = $540.

The final answer is: $540"
"To determine the total amount of sunscreen needed, we need to calculate the total number of ounces Pamela will use over the 8 days. 

Since she reapplies sunscreen every hour and will be outside 4 hours a day, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day. 

Over 8 days, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times/day * 8 days = 32 times.

Since each application is 1 ounce, she will need 32 ounces of sunscreen.

Each bottle contains 8 ounces, so to find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total ounces needed by the ounces per bottle: 32 ounces / 8 ounces per bottle = 4 bottles.

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

First, let's find 40% of the price of the blue car. 40% of $100 is 0.4 x $100 = $40.

Now, subtract $40 from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car: $100 - $40 = $60.

So, the price of the red car is $60.

The price of the blue car is $100.

The final answer is: $60"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Emil is 19 years old now. When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad and twice as old as his brother. 

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's current age as D, and his brother's current age as B. 

We know that E = 19. 

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = 0.5D. 

We can solve for D by multiplying both sides by 2: 48 = D.

When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B. 

We can solve for B by dividing both sides by 2: B = 12.

Now that we have the current ages of Emil's dad and brother, we can find their sum: D + B = 48 + 12 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads she received from her mother, sister, and friend, and then add them together.

Adrianne's mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day and add them together.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by the serving size: 21 / 3 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the number of students leaving early, we first need to find the number of football players, and then add the number of cheerleaders or band members.

First, let's find the number of football players. 20% of 30 students are football players. 

20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6

So, there are 6 football players.

Now, let's find the number of remaining students. Since 6 students are football players, the remaining students are 30 - 6 = 24.

Out of the remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band.

25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6

So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members.

Now, let's add the number of football players and cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early.

6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie's boots are size 5, we can multiply 5 by 5 to find Charlie's boot size.

Charlie's boot size = 5 * 5 = 25

Now, we need to find the average size of the two boots. To do this, we add the sizes of the two boots and divide by 2.

Average size = (5 + 25) / 2
Average size = 30 / 2
Average size = 15

"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to calculate the total space available for plants. 

First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches, since the width of the plants is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Now, let's subtract the space needed for the 1.5 feet (18 inches) between each plant. Since Pat already owns 17 flowers, we need to calculate the space for 17 + 1 (for the last plant) = 18 gaps between the plants.

Total space for gaps = 18 gaps * 18 inches/gap = 324 inches

Now, subtract the total space for gaps from the total length of the flower bed:

1332 inches - 324 inches = 1008 inches

Now, let's convert the remaining space back to feet:

1008 inches / 12 inches/foot = 84 feet

Since each plant is 12 inches wide, we can fit 84 feet / 12 inches/foot = 7 plants in each foot. 

Now, multiply the number of feet by the number of plants per foot:

84 feet * 7 plants/foot = 588 plants

However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so we subtract those from the total number of plants needed:

588 plants - 17 plants = 571 plants

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the plants:

571 plants * $6/plant = $3434

The final answer is: $3434"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day, we need to calculate 1/2 of the number of pretzels Edgar eats in a day. 

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. 
1/2 of 18 is 18 / 2 = 9 pretzels.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to multiply the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day by 7.

9 pretzels/day * 7 days = 63 pretzels

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of petunias: 
5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket = 15 petunias
Cost of 15 petunias = 15 * $3.00 = $45.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of sweet potato vines:
5 baskets * 2 sweet potato vines per basket = 10 sweet potato vines
Cost of 10 sweet potato vines = 10 * $2.50 = $25.00

Now, let's add the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines together:
Total cost = $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

"To find out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we first need to determine how much soil is left after planting the sunflowers and carnations.

First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations. 

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds
Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds

Now, let's subtract the amount of soil used from the total amount of soil they bought. 

30 pounds (total soil) - 27 pounds (used for sunflowers and carnations) = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, we can plant 3 roses with the remaining soil.

"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we first need to calculate how much she sets aside each month for shoes. 

Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets 25% of her paycheck aside for shoes. To find 25% of $2,000.00, we multiply $2,000.00 by 0.25.

$2,000.00 * 0.25 = $500.00

So, Jessica sets aside $500.00 each month for shoes. 

To find out how many shoes she can buy in a year, we need to multiply the monthly savings by 12 (the number of months in a year).

$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy with $6,000.00. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: peeling and cooking. 

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. Emily can peel 6 shrimp a minute, so to find the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 6. 

90 / 6 = 15 minutes to peel the shrimp.

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp. Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so to find the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 30 and then multiply by 10.

90 / 30 = 3, then 3 * 10 = 30 minutes to cook the shrimp.

However, since peeling and cooking are done sequentially, we need to add the time it takes to peel and cook the shrimp. 

15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (cooking) = 45 minutes.

The final answer is: 45"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in temperature after the air conditioner has been running and turned off.

First, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner is running on low for 3 hours. Since it cools the room by 2 degrees an hour, the total change in temperature will be -2 * 3 = -6 degrees.

Next, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner is running on high for 4 hours. Since it cools the room by 3 degrees an hour, the total change in temperature will be -3 * 4 = -12 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner is turned off for 2 hours. Since the room warms up by 2 degrees an hour, the total change in temperature will be 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net change in temperature is the sum of the changes in temperature when the air conditioner is running and turned off. So, the net change in temperature is -6 - 12 + 4 = -14 degrees.

However, this is the change in temperature from the point when the air conditioner was turned off. To find the final temperature, we need to consider the temperature change before the air conditioner was turned off. The air conditioner was running on low for 3 hours, which cooled the room by 6 degrees, and then it was running on high for 4 hours, which cooled the room by 12 degrees. So, the total change in temperature before the air conditioner was turned off is -6 - 12 = -18 degrees.

Now, we add the net change in temperature when the air conditioner was turned off to the total change in temperature before it was turned off. The final change in temperature is -18 - 14 = -32 degrees.

The final temperature is 32 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: $\boxed{32}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how old Bill's dad was when Bill saw the comet for the second time. 

Since Bill saw the comet when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, let's call the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet ""x"". Then, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is 3x.

We know that the time between the two sightings is 75 years, so we can set up the equation:

x + 75 = 3x

Subtracting x from both sides gives us:

75 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 37.5

Now that we know Bill's dad was 37.5 years old when he saw the comet, we can find out how old Bill was when his dad saw the comet. We are given that Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, so we can set up the equation:

Bill's age when his dad saw the comet = 30 - (age difference between Bill and his dad)

However, we don't know the age difference between Bill and his dad. We do know that Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was 3 times the age his father was when he saw the comet. So, we can set up the equation:

3x = Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time

We already know that x = 37.5, so:

3(37.5) = Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time

Now we can find the age difference between Bill and his dad:

Age difference = Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time - Bill's dad's age when he saw the comet
Age difference = 112.5 - 37.5

Now that we know the age difference, we can find Bill's age when his dad saw the comet:

Bill's age when his dad saw the comet = 30 - 75
Bill's age when his dad saw the comet = -45

However, this is not possible since age cannot be negative. This means that the initial assumption that Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Age difference = 112.5 - 37.5
Age difference = 75

However, this is not possible since age cannot be negative. This means that the initial assumption that Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Let's call the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet ""x"". Then, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is 3x. The time between the two sightings is 75 years, so we can set up the equation:

x + 75 = 3x

Subtracting x from both sides gives us:

75 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 37.5

Now that we know Bill's dad was 37.5 years old when he saw the comet, we can find out how old Bill was when his dad saw the comet. We are given that Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, so we can set up the equation:

Bill's age when his dad saw the comet = 30 - (age difference between Bill and his dad)

However, we don't know the age difference between Bill and his dad. We do know that Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was 3 times the age his father was when he saw the comet. So, we can set up the equation:

3x = Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time

We already know that x = 37.5, so:

3(37.5) = Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time
112.5 = Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time

Now we can find the age difference between Bill and his dad:

Age difference = Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time - Bill's dad's age when he saw the comet

"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each category and then add them together.

1. Checks for the electric bill: Since Buford writes a check once per month, and there are 12 months in a year, he writes 12 checks for the electric bill per year.
2. Checks for the gas bill: Similarly, he writes a check once per month for the gas bill, so he also writes 12 checks for the gas bill per year.
3. Checks to the church: Buford writes a check twice per month to the church, so in a year, he writes 2 * 12 = 24 checks to the church.
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: He writes a check quarterly, which means 4 times a year. So, he writes 4 checks to the pest and lawn service per year.

Now, let's add up the total number of checks: 
12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn service) = 52

The final answer is: 52"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as 'x'. Since the second plane makes 44 flights, which is half the number of flights made by the first plane, the first plane makes 2 * 44 = 88 flights per day.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, which is (3/4) * 88 = 66 flights. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France and Germany is (1/2) * (88 - 66) = 11.

Since the flights to France and Germany are equal, the number of flights to France is 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the individual howling times and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"Let's break down the information given. Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which means his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

So, the total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since Adam bought the trousers for $30, he must have contributed the remaining amount from his savings. To find out how much he contributed, we subtract the total amount received from his parents from the cost of the trousers: $30 - $18 = $12.

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to find the average age of the group. We know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Let's denote the average age as 'x'. 

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, Helene's age is 2x. We also know that the total age of the children is 20. 

The total age of the children can be represented as the sum of their individual ages: Akbar (3) + Alessandro (4) + Helene (2x) + Wilfred (let's denote Wilfred's age as 'w'). 

So, the equation becomes: 3 + 4 + 2x + w = 20.

We can simplify this equation by combining the constants: 7 + 2x + w = 20.

Now, we need to find the value of 'x' (the average age). We know that the average age is the total age divided by the number of children. There are 4 children, so the average age is 20 / 4 = 5.

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, Helene's age is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now we can substitute Helene's age into the equation: 7 + 2x + w = 20. We know Helene's age is 10, so 2x = 10. 

Solving for x, we get x = 5.

Now that we know the average age is 5, we can find the total age of the children by multiplying the average age by the number of children: 5 * 4 = 20.

However, we already knew that the total age of the children is 20. 

Now we can substitute the value of x into the equation: 7 + 2x + w = 20. We know x = 5, so 7 + 2(5) + w = 20.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 7 + 10 + w = 20.

Combine the constants: 17 + w = 20.

Now, we can solve for w: w = 20 - 17.

w = 3.

"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund, and then multiply it by 3.

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. 

Total amount collected so far = $500 + $1500 = $2000

Walter's friend donates $200, but this is not included in the amount that the lawyer will base his donation on. The lawyer will donate three times the amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, which is $2000.

So, the lawyer will donate 3 * $2000 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"
"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we first need to find out the total number of cookies. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is 1500 * 1/2 = 750.

Now, we know that each person in the church next door got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church next door, we need to divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got. 

Number of people in the church next door = Total cookies given to the church / Number of cookies each person got
= 750 / 15
= 50

"To solve this problem, let's assume the total number of slices the watermelon is divided into is 'x'. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is 6. 

Let's denote the number of slices each kid gets as 'k'. Since each adult gets twice as many slices as each kid, the number of slices each adult gets is '2k'. 

We know that the total number of slices is 6, so we can write the equation: 2k + 2k + 4k = 6. Combining like terms, we get 8k = 6. 

To find the value of 'k', we divide both sides by 8: k = 6/8 = 0.75. 

Now that we know 'k', we can find the number of slices each adult gets: 2k = 2 * 0.75 = 1.5. 

Since the total number of slices is 6, the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is (1.5/6) * 100 = 25%. 

The final answer is: 25"
"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we first need to calculate the total time spent on rounds and appointments.

Time spent on rounds: 
- Number of inpatients: 9
- Time per inpatient: 20 minutes
- Total time spent on rounds: 9 * 20 = 180 minutes

Time spent on appointments: 
- Number of appointments: 10
- Time per appointment: 30 minutes
- Total time spent on appointments: 10 * 30 = 300 minutes

Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 + 300 = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the total time spent to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic, so we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from his total time:
9 - 8 = 1 hour

Therefore, Doctor Jones has 1 hour left to update his records.

"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake. 

First, let's add the time it takes to make the cake batter (20 minutes) and bake the cake (30 minutes): 20 + 30 = 50 minutes.

Next, we add the time it takes to cool the cake (2 hours, which is 120 minutes) and the time to frost the cake (10 minutes): 120 + 10 = 130 minutes. 

Now, we add the time it takes to make the cake batter and bake the cake (50 minutes) to the time it takes to cool and frost the cake (130 minutes): 50 + 130 = 180 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

Now, we add the 3 hours to the time at which Jordan wants to serve the cake (5:00 pm) to find the latest time she can start making the cake: 5:00 pm + 3 hours = 8:00 pm.

The final answer is 8."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to first find the total number of boxes sold by both Lisa and Peter. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so together they sold 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

Since they sold 64 chocolate bars together and they sold 8 boxes, we can divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes to find out how many chocolate bars are in a box.

64 / 8 = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to first calculate the daily earnings and then multiply it by the number of days in a month.

The daily earnings can be calculated as follows:

- The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
- The cost per student per session is $1.50.
- The studio has 10 students, so the total cost per session for students is 10 * $1.50 = $15.
- The total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $15 (students) = $40.
- The studio is rented 3 days a week, so the weekly earnings are 3 * $40 = $120.
- There are approximately 4 weeks in a month, so the monthly earnings are 4 * $120 = $480.

However, this calculation does not take into account the number of sessions per week. Since we don't know the number of sessions per week, let's assume the studio is rented for a standard number of sessions per week, which is 5 (Monday to Friday). 

- The weekly earnings are 5 * $40 = $200.
- The monthly earnings are 4 * $200 = $800.

The final answer is: $800"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box for both Peter and Martha, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

For Peter: 64 chocolate bars / 4 boxes = 16 chocolate bars per box
For Martha: 56 chocolate bars / 7 boxes = 8 chocolate bars per box

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha. 

16 (Peter's chocolate bars per box) - 8 (Martha's chocolate bars per box) = 8

"To find the number of female porcupines, we multiply the total population by 3/5. 

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, we need to find the total number of babies born in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

Total babies born in a year = 30 * 4 * 12 = 1440

Now, we add the total number of babies born in a year to the initial population to find the total number of porcupines after a year.

Total porcupines after a year = 50 + 1440 = 1490

The final answer is: 1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as a swimming pool) is V = l * w * h, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height (or depth).

Given the dimensions of the pool: 
- Length (l) = 25 feet
- Width (w) = 14 feet
- Depth (h) = 4 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:
V = l * w * h
V = 25 * 14 * 4
V = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company instructed them to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the number of gallons of water needed, we do this next:
Gallons = V * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon:
Cost = Gallons * $0.10
Cost = 8260 * $0.10
Cost = $826

"To find the number of female students, we first need to determine the number of students over 16 and under 16, and then find the number of female students in each group.

Half of the students are over 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500 students.
One-fourth of the students over 16 are male: 1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16. 
So, the number of female students over 16 is 1500 - 375 = 1125.

The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500 students.
One-half of the students under 16 are male: 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16.
So, the number of female students under 16 is 1500 - 750 = 750.

Now, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16 to find the total number of female students: 1125 + 750 = 1875.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we need to subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run. 

Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank and subtract it from the tank's capacity.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons. 

The remaining amount of water needed to fill the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation representing the charge of the power bank at the end. Let's denote the initial charge as 'x'. 

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is 0.91x (since 100% - 9% = 91%, or 0.91 as a decimal).

After the first 5 hours, the power bank starts losing 7% of its capacity each hour for 3 hours. So, after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is 0.93 * 0.91x (since 100% - 7% = 93%, or 0.93 as a decimal).

We are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. We can set up the equation as follows:

0.93 * 0.91x = 0.28

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.8463 (which is 0.93 * 0.91):

x = 0.28 / 0.8463
x = 0.33

So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 33%.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate Janet's total weekly earnings and then determine how many weeks she needs to work to save 20% of the car's cost.

First, let's calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, so her total hourly earnings are $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25/hour * 40 hours/week = $1000/week.

Next, we need to calculate 20% of the car's cost. 20% of $10,000 is 0.20 * $10,000 = $2000.

Now, we can determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save $2000. We can do this by dividing the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her weekly earnings ($1000). 

$2000 / $1000 = 2

So, Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car.

2 kiwis at $1 each will be 2 * $1 = $2
5 apples at $0.75 each will be 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Adding these amounts together, Jamaar has spent $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9 so far.

Since Jamaar has $10, he has $10 - $9 = $1 left.

Plums cost $0.25 each, so we can divide the remaining amount by the cost of a plum to find out how many plums he can buy: $1 / $0.25 = 4

"To find out how many pieces of sweets each friend received, we first need to determine the total number of packs Anne gave away. Since she kept 2 packs for herself, she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Next, we need to find out how many packs each friend received. Since Anne gave the packs to her 10 friends equally, we divide the total number of packs given away (13) by the number of friends (10). 

13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs per friend. 

Since each pack contains 60 pieces, we multiply the number of packs each friend received by the number of pieces in each pack.

1.3 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 78 pieces.

So, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures by 8.

"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to determine how many sets of 3 pages he reads and then multiply that by the time it takes him to read one set of 3 pages.

Since James reads 18 pages, we can divide 18 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 pages he reads: 18 / 3 = 6.

Now, we know it takes James 10 minutes to read one set of 3 pages. Since he reads 6 sets, we multiply 10 minutes by 6: 10 * 6 = 60.

James spends 60 minutes reading his book."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.

24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests remaining is 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, so the number of guests remaining is still 76.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30. So, the number of guests now is 76 + 30 = 106.

After dinner, 7 more people checked in, so the final number of guests is 106 + 7 = 113.

The final answer is: 113"
"To find out how many bananas John has, we need to calculate the total number of bananas he picked. 

On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas. 
On Thursday, he picked 6 bananas. 
On Friday, he picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add up the total number of bananas John picked: 4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the number of points Aries is sure to get, we first need to determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions. 

40% of the 60 questions are easy, so the number of easy questions is 0.4 * 60 = 24. 
The rest of the questions are equally divided between average and difficult, so there are 60 - 24 = 36 questions left. 
Divide the remaining questions by 2 to find the number of average and difficult questions: 36 / 2 = 18.

Now, let's calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get right. 
Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 0.75 * 24 = 18. 
Aries is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 0.5 * 18 = 9. 

To find the total number of points Aries is sure to get, add the number of easy and average/difficult questions she is sure to get: 18 + 9 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 's' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'l'. We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write an equation:

s = 2l

We also know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4. Since Teresa sold 's' small stuffed animals, the total amount of money she earned from small stuffed animals is 4s.

The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal, which is 3 * 4 = $12. Since Teresa sold 'l' large stuffed animals, the total amount of money she earned from large stuffed animals is 12l.

We are given that Teresa earned a total of $120 from the sales. So, we can write another equation:

4s + 12l = 120

Now we can substitute the expression for 's' from the first equation into the second equation:

4(2l) + 12l = 120

Expanding the equation, we get:

8l + 12l = 120

Combine like terms:

20l = 120

Divide both sides by 20:

l = 6

Now that we know the number of large stuffed animals, we can find the number of small stuffed animals:

s = 2l
s = 2(6)
s = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches each person eats in a week and then add them together.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, so in a week (7 days), he eats 5 * 7 = 35 sandwiches.

The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, so in a week (7 days), she eats 4 * 7 = 28 sandwiches.

The son eats 2 sandwiches per day, so in a week (7 days), he eats 2 * 7 = 14 sandwiches.

Now, let's add the total number of sandwiches each person eats in a week: 35 (man) + 28 (wife) + 14 (son) = 77 sandwiches.

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week.

77"
"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings and then subtract the amount she gave to her sisters.

First, let's calculate her earnings from selling cookies: 80 cookies * $1 each = $80.

Next, let's calculate her earnings from selling cupcakes: 60 cupcakes * $4 each = $240.

Now, let's add her earnings from cookies and cupcakes: $80 + $240 = $320.

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave away a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

Now, let's subtract the amount she gave to her sisters from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To find the number of eggs found by the friends, we first need to determine the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins. Since each twin found 30 eggs, the total number of eggs found by the twins is 2 * 30 = 60.

Now, we know that all the eggs except 10 were found by the twins and their friends. This means that the total number of eggs found by the twins and their friends is 100 - 10 = 90.

Since the twins found 60 eggs, the number of eggs found by the friends can be calculated by subtracting the number of eggs found by the twins from the total number of eggs found by the twins and their friends. 

Number of eggs found by friends = Total eggs found by twins and friends - Eggs found by twins
= 90 - 60
= 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then multiply it by 40 dwarves and 30 days.

First, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe. Since he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe as with his bare hands, he can mine 2 * 12 = 24 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe.

Next, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. Since he can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe, he can mine 24 + (24 * 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes. Since one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, 40 dwarves can mine 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds of ore per day.

Finally, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in 30 days with steel pickaxes. Since they can mine 1440 pounds of ore per day, they can mine 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds of ore in 30 days.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for the first two packages. 

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.5 per sandwich. 

The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.5 per sandwich. 

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is consistent across all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is $1.5.

To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches: $1.5 * 8 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we first need to calculate the remaining amount he owes after using the money from selling his old bedroom set.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount Tom gets from selling his old bedroom: $1000
Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we need to calculate 10% of $2000.

10% of $2000 = 0.1 * $2000 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month. 

The final answer is: $200"
"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 40% of 25 is 0.4 * 25 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 6, so she released 6 yellow balloons, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

Now, let's calculate the total number of balloons she carried into the school. She had 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons. 

Total number of balloons = 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability that he won't get an extension. 

First, let's consider the case where the substitute teacher is present. The probability of this is 50%. If the substitute teacher is present, Marcus won't get an extension, so the probability of this case is 50% * 100% = 50%.

Next, let's consider the case where the normal teacher is present. The probability of this is 50%. If the normal teacher is present, there's a 60% chance Marcus won't get an extension (100% - 40%). So, the probability of this case is 50% * 60% = 30%.

Now, we need to consider the case where the normal teacher is present and Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment. The probability of this is 50% * 20% = 10%.

The total probability that Marcus won't get an extension is the sum of the probabilities of these cases: 50% + 30% + 10% = 90%. 

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 100% - 90% = 10%.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many tickets each graduate can receive, we first need to determine the total number of available seats for guests. 

The Fine Arts Center has space for 6000 people, but 950 seats are reserved for graduates and 300 seats are reserved for faculty. 

Total reserved seats = 950 (graduates) + 300 (faculty) = 1250 seats

Available seats for guests = 6000 (total capacity) - 1250 (reserved seats) = 4750 seats

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive.

Tickets per graduate = 4750 (available seats) / 950 (number of graduates) = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the relationship between the number of small, medium, and large jelly beans. 

Let's start by using the information that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. This means that the number of small beans is 3 times the number of medium beans.

Let's denote the number of medium beans as M. Then, the number of small beans is 3M.

We are also given that Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans. Let's denote the number of large beans as L. Then, the number of medium beans is 2L, and the number of small beans is 3(2L) = 6L.

We know that it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up. Since Grandpa can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, he can eat 2L large beans and 4L medium beans (since 2L = 2 * 2L). 

The total number of beans Grandpa can eat is 75 (large) + 4L (medium) = 75 + 4L. Since this total is equal to the number of small beans (6L), we can set up the equation:

75 + 4L = 6L

Subtracting 4L from both sides gives us:

75 = 2L

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

37.5 = L

Since we can't have a fraction of a jelly bean, this means that Grandpa can eat 75 large beans, 150 medium beans, and 450 small beans.

The final answer is: 450"
"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total earnings and total expenses. 

Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so her total hours worked is 6 * 3 = 18 hours. 

Her total earnings are $15 per day for 3 days, which is 15 * 3 = $45.

Her total expenses for parking are $3 per day for 3 days, which is 3 * 3 = $9.

Now, we subtract her total expenses from her total earnings to find her net earnings: 45 - 9 = $36.

To find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her net earnings by her total hours worked: 36 / 18 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of the books is 3 * 16 = 48 dollars.
The cost of the pencils is 3 * 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the books and the pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

So, Ted spent a total of 66 dollars.

The final answer is: 66"
"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to first determine how many soda bottles he will place along the driveway. 

Since the driveway is 24 feet wide and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet, we can divide the total width of the driveway by the spacing between the bottles:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since it takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we can multiply the number of bottles by the time it takes to set off each one:

8 bottles * 5 seconds per bottle = 40 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 40 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many packs Uncle Franky can make, we first need to determine the total number of apples he has. Since he ordered two boxes and each box contains 40 apples, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of apples in each box.

Total apples = 2 boxes * 40 apples/box = 80 apples

Next, we need to find out how many packs he can make with 80 apples. Since each pack contains 8 apples, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each pack.

Number of packs = Total apples / apples per pack = 80 / 8 = 10

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought and subtract that from the initial amount of money she had.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 * $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 * $6 = $18.
The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor starts with $50, so subtracting the total cost of the cheese from that amount, we get $50 - $40 = $10.

The final answer is: $10"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost due to loans and lost income while in college. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of loans he took: 
4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money he lost due to not working while in college. 
His income before college was $25,000/year. 
His income after college is tripled, so it's $25,000 * 3 = $75,000/year. 
The difference in income is $75,000 - $25,000 = $50,000/year. 
Since he didn't work for 4 years, he lost 4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000.

The total amount of money he needs to earn is the sum of the loans and the lost income: 
$200,000 (loans) + $200,000 (lost income) = $400,000.

Now, let's calculate how long it would take him to earn this amount at his new income of $75,000/year:
Time = Total amount / Annual income
Time = $400,000 / $75,000
Time = 5.33 years

The final answer is: 5.33"
"To find the total area of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the larger fabric pieces. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide, so the larger fabric pieces will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet long and 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.

The area of each fabric piece is length times width, so the area of each piece is 8 * 10 = 80 square feet. Since Jim needs two pieces, he needs a total of 2 * 80 = 160 square feet of fabric.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then add them up.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 17 more than that is 85 + 17 = 102. So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 5 more than that is 204 + 5 = 209. So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, let's add up the number of letters delivered each day: 425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

The final answer is: 736"
"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

The cost of the chicken salad is 10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.
The cost of the pasta salad is 6 people * $6 per person = $36.

Now, we add the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad together: $65 + $36 = $101.

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101."
"To find the average loss, we need to calculate the total loss and then divide it by the number of races.

First, let's calculate the amount Johnny's dad lost in the first race: -$5.

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, the amount he won in the second race is 2 * (-$5) + $1 = -$9.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, the amount he lost in the third race is 1.5 * (-$9) = -$13.50.

Now, let's calculate the total loss: -$5 + (-$9) + (-$13.50) = -$27.50.

There were 3 races, so the average loss is: -$27.50 / 3 = -$9.17

"To find the total population of South America, we need to calculate the total number of people living in all the cities across all the countries.

First, let's find the total number of people living in one country. There are 5 cities in each country, and each city has 1000 people. 

Total people in one country = 5 cities * 1000 people per city = 5000 people

Since there are 26 countries in South America, we can multiply the total number of people in one country by the number of countries to find the total population of South America.

Total population of South America = 5000 people per country * 26 countries = 130,000 people

The final answer is: 130000"
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we first need to calculate their current heights. 

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet, which is equivalent to 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches). He grew 3 inches over the summer, so his current height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Cole's initial height was 50 inches and he grew 2 inches over the summer, so his current height is 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

The difference in height between Cole and Xavier is 52 - 51 = 1 inch.

The final answer is: 1"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the share of the first person as x. 

Since the second person took $80 more than the first, the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, and the sum of their shares is equal to this amount. We can write the equation as:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine like terms again:

4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:

4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 420

The share of the first person is $420.

The final answer is: $420"
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we first need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks have 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since the painters worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to find out how many hours that is. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days to get the total hours worked: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4 to get the hours worked by each painter: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final numerical answer is: 47.25"
"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Expanding the equation:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

Number of balls in the first set = x + 4
= 6 + 4

"To find the price of the car in the year 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation of the car from 2007 to 2010.

The car was bought in 2007 for $20,000. 

The price of the car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. 

First, we'll calculate the price of the car in 2008:
Price in 2008 = 20,000 - (20,000 * 0.21) = 20,000 - 4,200 = $15,800

Next, we'll calculate the price of the car in 2009:
Price in 2009 = 15,800 - (15,800 * 0.21) = 15,800 - 3,318 = $12,482

Finally, we'll calculate the price of the car in 2010:
Price in 2010 = 12,482 - (12,482 * 0.21) = 12,482 - 2,623.22 = $9,858.78

The price of the car in the year 2010 is $9,858.78."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to determine the total number of books that are not written in English or German. 

Since half of the books are written in English, that's 50 / 2 = 25 books in English.

10% of the books are written in German, which is 0.1 * 50 = 5 books in German.

Now, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total to find the number of Spanish books: 50 - 25 - 5 = 20.

"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance. 

First, let's calculate the total distance Bernice has driven: 
Distance driven = 325 kilometers/day * 4 days = 1300 kilometers

Now, let's subtract the distance driven from the total distance:
Total distance = 1955 kilometers
Distance driven = 1300 kilometers
Distance left = Total distance - Distance driven
Distance left = 1955 - 1300
Distance left = 655 kilometers

"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first calculate how many cups she drinks in 30 days and then convert that to gallons.

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. To find out how many cups she drinks in 30 days, we multiply the number of cups she drinks per day by 30.

8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups

Now, we need to convert the total number of cups to gallons. There are 16 cups in a gallon, so we divide the total number of cups by 16.

240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Romeo boards the train with 120 people.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the total number of people on the train becomes:
120 (initial people) + 20 (new people) = 140

At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (100 people) board the train. So, the total number of people on the train becomes:
140 (previous total) - 50 (people who descended) = 90
90 + 100 (new people) = 190

At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the total number of people on the train becomes:
190 (previous total) - 80 (people who descended) = 110

"To find the total amount Alison spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

1. The tank top costs $10.
2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48, but they were on sale for half price. Half of $48 is $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The athletic socks cost $8, and she had a coupon for $2 off, so the socks cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: $10 (tank top) + $15 (shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55.

"To determine the total cost of renovating your kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and then multiply it by the cost of each tile.

First, let's find the area of a single tile. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1 ft, the area of a single tile is 1 ft * 1 ft = 1 SqFt.

Next, we need to find the total number of tiles required to cover the kitchen floor. Since the total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt and each tile covers 1 SqFt, we need 200 tiles.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the tiles. The cost of each tile is $12, and we need 200 tiles. So, the total cost is 200 * $12 = $2400.

The increased cost is $120 + $72 = $192 per month.

To find the yearly cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12. 

$192 x 12 = $2,304 per year.

The final answer is: $2,304"
"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a week, we need to calculate the total number of twin and king size sheets he puts on the beds and then divide that by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. Since each twin bed requires 1 set of sheets and the king size bed requires 1 set of sheets, the total number of sets of sheets he puts on the beds is 4 (twin) + 1 (king) = 5 sets.

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 1, which is 2. This means that Greg can wash 2 twin sets of sheets and 1 king set of sheets in 2 loads.

Now, let's calculate the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a week. Since he has 5 sets of sheets to wash and he can wash 3 sets (2 twin + 1 king) in 2 loads, he will need 2.5 loads to wash all the sheets. However, since we can't have a fraction of a load, we round up to the nearest whole number. So, Greg does 3 loads of laundry in a week.

To find the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we multiply the number of loads he does in a week by the number of weeks in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year is 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year.

The final answer is: 156"
"To find the total number of movies Jill and her friends watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of movies they watch in one weekend and multiply it by 4.

They watch 4 movies on Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in one weekend, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

To find the total number of movies they watch in 4 weeks, we multiply the number of movies they watch in one weekend by 4: 6 * 4 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how many stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to calculate the total number of stickers he collected over the past three years.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. 
Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.
This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.
So, this year he has 150 + 100 = 250 stickers.

The total number of stickers Leo has in his collection is 250 + 150 = 400 stickers.

The final answer is: 400"
"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount of cat food each cat eats per day (60 grams).

First, we need to calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's 3 cats eat per day. Since each cat eats 60 grams of food twice a day, we multiply 60 grams by 2 to get the daily consumption per cat, which is 120 grams. Then, we multiply this by the number of cats, which is 3.

Daily consumption per cat: 60 grams * 2 = 120 grams
Total daily consumption for 3 cats: 120 grams * 3 = 360 grams

Now, we divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the total daily consumption (360 grams) to find out how many days it will last.

720 grams / 360 grams = 2

The cat food will last for 2 days."
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

We know that Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake did, Jake must have eaten 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

We also know that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake did, so Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

To find the total number of slices eaten, we need to add up the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia. 

Total slices eaten = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices eaten = 10 + 7 + 14
Total slices eaten = 31

"Let's denote the time Donovan took as 'x'. Since Betsy took 18 minutes longer than Donovan, the time Betsy took is 'x + 18'. The total time they took together is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since x is Donovan's time, and Betsy's time is x + 18, we can find Betsy's time:
Betsy's time = 40 + 18 = 58

The final answer is: 58"
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the costs of the cast, the visit, the painkillers, and the parking.

The cost of the cast is $200.

The cost of the visit is $300/hour for 0.5 hours (since it's a 30-minute visit). So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.

The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill for 30 pills. So, the cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

The cost of parking is $6/hour for 2 hours. So, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up the costs: $200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482.

"To find out how many emails James responds to, we first need to find out how many emails he doesn't respond to. 

20% of 80 emails is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails. 

Since James doesn't respond to these 16 emails, he responds to the rest. The rest of the emails are 80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Now, we need to find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week. Since he responds to 64 emails per day, in a 5-day work week, he responds to 64 * 5 = 320 emails.

The final answer is: 320"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we need to calculate the number of classes that visited each day and then add them up.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 64 = 192 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the number of classes that visited each day:
32 + 64 + 192 + 30 + 25 = 303

The final answer is: 303"
"To find the average score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the number of tests. 

First, let's add up the scores of the first 3 tests: 100 + 100 + 100 = 300. 

Then, we add the score of the 4th test: 300 + 80 = 380.

Now, we divide the total score by the number of tests: 380 / 4 = 95.

The final answer is: 95"
"To find the total number of pizzas left, we first need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by both the glee club and the football team.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find 70% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.7:
20 * 0.7 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them. To find 80% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.8:
40 * 0.8 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

Now, we add the number of pizzas eaten by both groups to find the total number of pizzas eaten:
14 (glee club) + 32 (football team) = 46 pizzas eaten in total.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

To find the number of pizzas left, we subtract the total number of pizzas eaten from the total number of pizzas ordered:
60 - 46 = 14 pizzas left.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of big coupons. Since Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and he's sending out 700 small coupons, he'll send out 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons.

The cost of mailing the small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

The cost of mailing the big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

Now, let's add the cost of mailing the small and big coupons together: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

The final answer is: $245"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. This means Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

2. Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. So, the total number of meatballs in the 7 sub sandwiches is 7 * 4 = 28.

3. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. This means there are now 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches left.

4. Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining 3 sub sandwiches is 3 * 4 = 12.

"To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we first need to determine the number of trucks that did not experience mechanical failures. 

Since a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, we can calculate the number of trucks that failed as follows:

Number of trucks dispatched = 20
Number of trucks with mechanical failures = 20 * (1/4) = 5

Now, we subtract the number of trucks with mechanical failures from the total number of trucks dispatched to find the number of trucks that reached the farmers:

Number of trucks that reached the farmers = 20 - 5 = 15

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we multiply the number of trucks that reached the farmers by the tons of fertiliser each truck carried:

Total tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers = 15 * 20 = 300

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the butter. Since Dennis needs 6 dozen croissants, and he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen, he needs 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store promotion is buy one pound of butter get one half off, which means that for every two pounds of butter, he pays the full price of one pound. 

So, for 6 pounds of butter, he will pay for 3 pounds at the full price and 3 pounds at half the price. 

The cost of 3 pounds at the full price is 3 * $4.00 = $12.00. 

The cost of 3 pounds at half the price is 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.

The total cost is $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00.

The final numerical answer is: $18.00"
"To find the total cost of the party, we need to calculate the number of guests and then apply the given fee structure.

First, let's find the total number of guests. Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 dance class girls, and 13 family members, but 4 people said they couldn't come. So, the total number of guests is:
25 (classmates) + 7 (dance class girls) + 13 (family members) - 4 (those who couldn't come) = 41

Since the theater can accommodate 20 guests for $125, and there are 41 guests, we need to calculate the additional guests:
41 (total guests) - 20 (base capacity) = 21 (additional guests)

The fee for the additional guests is $6 per person, so the cost for the additional guests is:
21 (additional guests) * $6 (per guest) = $126

Now, we add the base fee and the cost for the additional guests to find the total cost:
$125 (base fee) + $126 (additional guests) = $251

The final answer is: $251"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Maggie and Riza spent. 

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 of $60. To find this, we multiply 60 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing 60 by 4. 

60 / 4 = 15

So Maggie spent $15. 

Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 of $60. To find this, we multiply 60 by 1/3, which is the same as dividing 60 by 3.

60 / 3 = 20

So Riza spent $20.

Now, we need to find out how much money they had initially. Since they each had $60, together they had 2 * 60 = $120.

Maggie spent $15 and Riza spent $20, so together they spent $15 + $20 = $35.

To find out how much money they have left, we subtract the amount they spent from the amount they initially had: $120 - $35 = $85.

The final answer is: $85"
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to determine how many bananas the first and second monkeys eat each day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. 

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Since there are three monkeys in total, the total number of bananas they eat each day is 10 + 14 + x, where x is the number of bananas the third monkey eats. However, we know that the total number of bananas is 315, and they eat this amount for a week, which is 7 days. 

So, the total number of bananas eaten in a week is 315 * 7 = 2205 bananas.

Since they eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas in a day, the number of bananas they eat in a week is 24 * 7 = 168 bananas.

Now, we can find the number of bananas the third monkey eats in a week by subtracting the total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total bananas eaten in a week: 2205 - 168 = 2037. However, this is incorrect because we are trying to find the number of bananas the third monkey eats in a day, not a week.

To find the number of bananas the third monkey eats in a day, we need to find the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a day, which is 24. Then, we need to find the total number of bananas eaten in a day, which is 315. The third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day, so we need to subtract the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten in a day: 315 - 24 = 291.

"To find out how many puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to determine how many pieces he placed in total and then subtract the pieces he placed before the hour. 

Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which is 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. 

Then, he finished another 500 piece puzzle. 

So, in total, he placed 250 + 500 = 750 pieces. 

Since he already placed 250 pieces before the hour, we subtract those from the total to find out how many pieces he placed during the hour: 750 - 250 = 500.

The final answer is: 500"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses and then find out how much change Jenny will get.

First, let's calculate the cost of the roses. Jenny bought 15 roses, but since a dozen roses cost $15, we can't buy a fraction of a dozen. So, we'll calculate the cost of 12 roses and the cost of 3 additional roses separately.

The cost of 12 roses is $15. 
The cost of 3 additional roses is 3 * $2 = $6.

The total cost of the roses is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25.

To find out how much change she will get, we subtract the total cost of the roses from the amount she arrived with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the revenue from each item and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the revenue from milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50 each = $33.

Next, let's calculate the revenue from burger platters: 9 burger platters * $11 each = $99.

Lastly, let's calculate the revenue from sodas: 20 sodas * $1.50 each = $30.

Now, let's add the revenues together: $33 + $99 + $30 = $162.

The final answer is: $162"
"To find the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the time intervals between the trains and the time Paul needs to wait for his train.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the train Paul will board.

Now, we need to find the time Paul needs to wait for his train. Since the current time is not given, we assume Paul starts waiting at time 0. The first train arrives at 10 minutes, but Paul will not board it. The second train arrives at 60 minutes, but Paul will not board it. The third train arrives at 125 minutes, but Paul will not board it. The fourth train arrives at 145 minutes, which is the train Paul will board.

To find the waiting time, we need to subtract the time the first train arrives from the time the fourth train arrives: 145 - 10 = 135 minutes. However, this is not the total waiting time. We need to consider the time Paul waits after the third train leaves the station. The third train leaves the station at 125 minutes, and the fourth train arrives at 145 minutes. So, Paul waits for 145 - 125 = 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station.

The total waiting time is the sum of the time Paul waits before the third train leaves the station and the time Paul waits after the third train leaves the station: 135 + 20 = 155 minutes.

The final answer is: 155"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far and then determine how many more weeks it will take her to reach 200 toothpicks.

Melanie saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. To find the total number of toothpicks she has saved, we multiply the number of toothpicks saved per week by the number of weeks:

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks for the sculpture, we subtract the number of toothpicks she has saved from the total required:

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks. Since she saves 10 toothpicks per week, we divide the remaining number of toothpicks by the number saved per week:

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, Melanie will need 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we first need to determine the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price, so the price he paid is 75% of $2000, which is 0.75 * $2000 = $1500.

Then, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is 1.2 * $1500 = $1800.

To find the discount percentage, we need to find the difference between the original price and the price at which Mr. Rogers' friend bought the watch, and then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100.

The discount is ($2000 - $1800) = $200.

The percentage discount is ($200 / $2000) * 100 = 10%.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours and then multiply it by the rate at which the springs create jellyfish.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute. So, the total number of seconds in 4 hours is:

60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since each spring creates a new jellyfish every second, the total number of jellyfish created by one spring in 14400 seconds is 14400.

Now, if we have 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created in 14400 seconds is:

14400 * 5 = 72000

So, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

The final answer is: 72000"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score and then add 15 to it. 

Binkie's score is 90. Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180. 

Now, we add 15 to 180 to find Frankie's score: 180 + 15 = 195.

The final answer is: 195"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance James walked and then divide it by his speed.

First, James walked to the store, which is 4 miles. Then, he walked back home, which is another 4 miles. So, the total distance he walked is 4 + 4 = 8 miles.

Since James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the time it took him to walk the total distance by dividing the total distance by his speed: 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours.

However, this is the total time it took him to walk to the store and back home. Since the question asks for the time it took him to reach the store, we need to divide this time by 2, as he walked to the store and back. So, 2 hours / 2 = 1 hour.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we first need to calculate the total cost of buying the bananas individually and then compare it to the cost of buying them in bunches.

If Jenny buys 10 bunches with 4 bananas per bunch, she buys a total of 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

The cost of buying 10 bunches is $3.00 per bunch, so the total cost is 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

So, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.

We know that the total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence. To find out how much is left over, we need to subtract the total amount of fence Sam and Harry have from the total length of the fence:

100 - (20 + (20 + 60)) = 100 - 100 = 0

However, this is not the correct interpretation of the question. The question asks how much is left over for Sam, implying that the leftover is the amount of fence that is not assigned to either Sam or Harry. Since Sam and Harry together have 100 feet, and they have 100 feet in total, there is no leftover fence."
"To find the rate at which the crocodile grows per year, we need to divide the growth in inches by the number of years it took to achieve that growth. 

Growth rate per year = 8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year.

Now, we can multiply the growth rate per year by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

Total growth in 13 years = 2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

First, let's find the number of each type of bike sold:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150
- BMX bikes: 300 * 0.15 = 45
- MTB bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105

Now, let's calculate the revenue from each type of bike:
- Revenue from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- Revenue from BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250 (since BMX is half the price of MTB, which is $500, so BMX is $500 / 2 = $250)
- Revenue from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add up the revenue from all types of bikes:
$67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck, and then subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

To find the number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer: 30 - 18 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total time John spends learning, we need to calculate the time spent in classes, and the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday.

First, let's find the total time spent in classes. John takes 2 extra classes, each 40 minutes long, 5 days a week. 

Time spent in classes per day = 2 * 40 minutes = 80 minutes
Time spent in classes per week = 80 minutes * 5 days = 400 minutes

Now, let's find the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday. John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time. 

First, we need to find the total minutes in a week. There are 24 hours in a day, and 7 days in a week. 
Total minutes in a day = 24 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 1440 minutes
Total minutes in a week = 1440 minutes * 7 days = 10080 minutes

Now, we can find the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday.
Extra time per week = 1/16 * 10080 minutes = 630 minutes

Now, we can find the total time spent learning per week.
Total time spent learning per week = Time spent in classes per week + Extra time per week
Total time spent learning per week = 400 minutes + 630 minutes = 1030 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60.
Total time spent learning per week = 1030 minutes / 60 = 17.17 hours

"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to first find the initial height from which it is dropped. Since the third floor is 24 feet high, and assuming the ground floor is at 0 feet, the initial height is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

The ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height with each bounce. So, on the first bounce, it will reach a height of 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, it will again reach 2/3 of the height it reached on the first bounce, which is 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child in inches. 

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child's height in inches is 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to determine the number of bags sold and then multiply that by the price per bag.

Since the orchard sold a total of 2000 apples and each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag to find the number of bags sold.

Number of bags sold = Total apples / Apples per bag
= 2000 / 10
= 200

Now, we can multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Number of bags sold * Price per bag

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the amount of meat left after the Allosaurus ate. 

The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, which was half of what was left after the velociraptors scavenged. 

Let's call the amount of meat left after the velociraptors scavenged 'x'. Since the Allosaurus ate half of this, we can set up the equation: x / 2 = 270. 

To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2: x = 270 * 2. 

x = 540 kilograms. 

This is the amount of meat left after the velociraptors scavenged. 

The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. Let's call the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate 'y'. Since the velociraptors scavenged half of this, we can set up the equation: y / 2 = 540. 

To solve for y, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2: y = 540 * 2. 

y = 1080 kilograms. 

This is the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate. 

The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the original amount of meat on the triceratops is twice the amount the T-Rex ate. 

Let's call the original amount of meat 'z'. Since the T-Rex ate half of this, we can set up the equation: z / 2 = 1080. 

To solve for z, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2: z = 1080 * 2. 

z = 2160 kilograms.

The final answer is: 2160"
"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted and then divide it by the coverage of a gallon of paint to find out how many gallons are needed. After that, we can multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon to get the total cost.

First, let's calculate the area of each wall:
- North wall: 10 x 8 = 80 square feet
- South wall: 10 x 8 = 80 square feet
- East wall: 5 x 8 = 40 square feet
- West wall: 5 x 8 = 40 square feet

Now, let's add up the areas of all the walls:
80 + 80 + 40 + 40 = 240 square feet

Since a gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, we need to divide the total area by 20 to find out how many gallons are needed:
240 / 20 = 12 gallons

Now, let's multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon to find the total cost:
12 gallons * $12/gallon = $144

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to determine the probability of her choosing a shaken can out of the remaining cans.

Initially, there were 12 sodas. Ellen shook 3 of them, so 9 were unshaken. She took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken and 3 shaken sodas. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas.

The total number of sodas left is 2 (shaken) + 6 (unshaken) = 8.

The probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans: 2/8 = 0.25.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. To find the distance it travels in 3 hours, we multiply its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. To find the distance it travels in 3 hours, we multiply its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 90 miles

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we add the distances they traveled to find the total distance between them:

Total Distance = Distance of first train + Distance of second train
Total Distance = 180 miles + 90 miles
Total Distance = 270 miles

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we first need to determine the number of days he works. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days (since April 19th is the last day). So, the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th is 31 + 19 = 50 days.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. To do this, we multiply 50 by 0.2: 50 * 0.2 = 10.

This means Billy takes 10 days off. So, the number of days he works is 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, which means he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

To find the total number of people he can help, we multiply the number of days he works by the number of people he can help per day: 40 * 6 = 240.

"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people who were transported by the buses and the cars, and then subtract that from the total number of people who attended the wedding.

First, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the buses: 
12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the cars: 
20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Now, let's add the number of people transported by the buses and the cars: 
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the total number of people who attended the wedding is the sum of the people inside the church and the people outside, we can assume that the number of people outside the church is the sum of the number of private cars and buses, which is 20 + 12 = 32 people.

Now, let's calculate the total number of people who attended the wedding: 
32 people (outside the church) + 480 people (transported) = 512 people

To find the number of people inside the church, we subtract the number of people outside the church from the total number of people who attended the wedding: 
512 people - 32 people = 480 people

Now that we know Micah ran 28 miles, we can subtract the total miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles run by all three to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

Total miles run by all three = 52 miles
Miles run by Amber = 8 miles
Miles run by Micah = 28 miles
Miles run by Ahito = Total miles - (Miles run by Amber + Miles run by Micah)

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total amount she spent after returning the item and then add that to the initial charge minus the returned item.

First, let's calculate the amount Sheila got back after returning the item:
$85.00 (initial charge) - $15.00 (returned item) = $70.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan:
The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage:
$20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00
Now, subtract the discount from the original price:
$20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the set of towels:
The set of towels was 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage:
$30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00
Now, subtract the discount from the original price:
$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the amount Sheila got back after returning the item:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue, so the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means x/15 = 6.

To find the total number of jellyfish, we can solve for x: x = 6 * 15 = 90.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate Lauren's total savings needed for retirement and then determine how many years she needs to work to achieve that goal.

First, let's calculate Lauren's annual expenses in retirement. Since she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, her annual expenses will be 0.4 * $100,000 = $40,000.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount Lauren needs to save for retirement. This will be her annual expenses multiplied by the number of years she plans to live in retirement: $40,000 * 20 = $800,000.

Since Lauren saves 20% of her salary each year, we need to calculate her annual savings: 0.2 * $100,000 = $20,000.

Now, we can calculate the number of years Lauren needs to work to save $800,000: $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save for retirement, but we are asked how many more years she needs to work. Since we don't know how many years she has already worked, we will assume she has worked 0 years.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the length of each final cut, we first need to determine the length of each of the 4 equal parts that Marty will get after cutting the ribbon. 

Since Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon and he needs to cut it into 4 equal parts, we divide 100 by 4 to get the length of each part. 

100 cm / 4 = 25 cm

Now, each of these 4 parts needs to be divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these smaller parts, we divide 25 cm by 5.

25 cm / 5 = 5 cm

So, the length of each final cut will be 5 cm.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total population of the school, we can use the information given about the boys. Since 40% of the school population is 240 boys, we can set up the equation:

0.4x = 240

where x is the total population of the school.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

Now that we know the total population of the school is 600, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total population:

Number of girls = Total population - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items before applying the coupon. 

The cost of the set of pots is $19, and the cost of the sack of garden soil is $26. 

Total cost = cost of pots + cost of soil = $19 + $26 = $45

Now, we need to subtract the coupon value from the total cost to get the final amount spent.

Final amount spent = Total cost - coupon value = $45 - $7 = $38

The final answer is: $38"
"To find the average height of heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide it by the total number of women.

The three women wearing 4-inch heels have a total height of 3 * 4 = 12 inches.
The three women wearing 2-inch heels have a total height of 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.
There are 6 women in total.

The average height of heels at the party is 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

The final answer is: 3"
"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Since Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days, we can calculate her daily target by dividing the total miles by the number of days:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Soledad is planning to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is a total of 250 miles per day. To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we subtract her planned daily miles from her target daily miles:

310 miles per day - 250 miles per day = 60 miles per day

So, Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total amount the store will receive after selling all the balls, we need to calculate the total revenue from each color of balls and add them together.

First, let's calculate the total revenue from each color of balls:

- Red balls: 3 balls * $9 per ball = $27
- Blue balls: 11 balls * $5 per ball = $55
- Green balls: 25 balls * $3 per ball = $75

Now, let's add the revenue from each color together to find the total revenue:

$27 (red) + $55 (blue) + $75 (green) = $157

The store will have received a total of $157 after all the balls are sold.

The final answer is: $157"
"To find out how much James will have left, we first need to determine how much Pierre and Paul will take. 

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg. 

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

So, Pierre and Paul will take 3 + 4 = 7 kg in total.

Since they started with 12 kg, James will have 12 - 7 = 5 kg left.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the temperature in the morning, we need to subtract the temperature drop from the initial temperature and then add the temperature increase.

Initial temperature = 2 degrees Celsius
Temperature drop = 8 degrees Celsius
Temperature increase = 3 degrees Celsius

First, subtract the temperature drop from the initial temperature:
2 - 8 = -6 degrees Celsius

Then, add the temperature increase to the result:
-6 + 3 = -3 degrees Celsius

The temperature in the morning was -3 degrees Celsius.

-3"
"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the initial amount he had, and then add the amount he saved.

Raymond initially had $21. He saved $11, so we add that to his initial amount: $21 + $11 = $32.

Then, he spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle, so we subtract the total amount he spent from the new total: $32 - ($5 + $19) = $32 - $24 = $8.

So, Raymond has $8 left.

The final answer is: $8"
"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first determine how much Anna spent in total. We know she had a budget of $16 and has $2 left, so she spent $16 - $2 = $14.

Since she spent $14 in total and bought 2 books that cost the same amount, we can divide the total amount spent by 2 to find the cost of each book. 

Cost of each book = Total amount spent / Number of books
Cost of each book = $14 / 2
Cost of each book = $7

The final answer is: $7"
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we need to calculate 20% of the previous year's enrollment and add it to the previous year's enrollment.

20% of 50 is 0.20 x 50 = 10.

So, the increase in enrollment is 10 students.

To find the total number of students this year, we add the increase to the previous year's enrollment: 50 + 10 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we need to first determine the rate at which the light blinks. 

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. To find the rate, we divide the number of blinks by the time: 255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute.

Now, we can use this rate to find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times. We divide the total number of blinks by the rate: 459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute.

459 / 51 = 9 minutes.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total number of male and female fishes, we need to add the initial and additional numbers of each type.

Initial male guppies: 4
Additional male guppies: 2
Total male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6

Initial female guppies: 7
Additional female guppies: 1
Total female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8

Initial male goldfishes: 3
Additional male goldfishes: 2
Total male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5

Initial female goldfishes: 5
Additional female goldfishes: 3
Total female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's find the total number of male and female fishes:
Total male fishes: 6 (guppies) + 5 (goldfishes) = 11
Total female fishes: 8 (guppies) + 8 (goldfishes) = 16

To find the difference between the number of female and male fishes, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes:
Difference = Total female fishes - Total male fishes
Difference = 16 - 11
Difference = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total time they all took to do their chores, we need to calculate the time each person took and add them together.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took over 4 hours longer than Amalia, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, let's add the time each person took to do their chores: 4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours.

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"To find the total distance John drives in a month, we need to calculate the round trip distance for one visit and then multiply it by the number of visits.

The round trip distance for one visit is 2 hours * 70 mph = 140 miles.

Since John visits his parents twice a month, the total distance driven in a month is 140 miles * 2 visits = 280 miles.

The final numerical answer is: 280"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we can multiply the number of miles she walks per day by the number of days:

10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

Sofie's distance = 2 * Brian's distance

We know that Sofie's distance is 70 miles, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

70 miles = 2 * Brian's distance

To find Brian's distance, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Brian's distance = 70 miles / 2
Brian's distance = 35 miles

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

The final answer is: 35"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers and then find out how many toys the fifth worker must produce to meet the remaining demand.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour. Since they work for 10 hours, they produce a total of 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys.

Next, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the other 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour. Since they work for 10 hours, they produce a total of 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys.

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to meet the order, the fifth worker must produce 20 toys in 10 hours.

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker (20) by the number of hours worked (10). 

20 toys / 10 hours = 2 toys per hour.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we first need to find the weight of each of his dogs. 

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/4 to find the weight of Elijah's first dog: 60 * (1/4) = 15 pounds.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/2 to find the weight of Elijah's second dog: 60 * (1/2) = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of Elijah's two dogs to find the total weight of his dogs: 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

To find the total weight of all three dogs, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs: 60 + 45 = 105 pounds.

The final answer is: 105"
"To solve this problem, let's work backwards from the information given.

Kris had 7 stickers left after giving some to Rob. Before that, Kris had 7 + 9 = 16 stickers.

Luis gave the rest of the stickers to Kris, so Kris had 16 stickers that were given to him by Luis. Since Kris kept 9 stickers, Luis must have given him 16 - 9 = 7 stickers.

Luis had half of the stickers that Seth gave him. So, Seth gave Luis 7 * 2 = 14 stickers.

Since Seth gave Luis 14 stickers, Seth had 14 * 2 = 28 stickers in the beginning.

The final answer is: 28"
"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to calculate the total weight of the M&M's and then multiply it by the number of M&M's per ounce. 

First, let's find the total weight of the M&M's: 3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces.

Since an ounce of M&M's has 30 M&M's, the total number of M&M's is 30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's.

Now, we need to find out how many small bags John can make. Each small bag contains 10 M&M's, so we divide the total number of M&M's by 10: 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per small bag = 90 small bags.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to first calculate half of the earth's circumference. 

The earth's circumference is 40,000 kilometers. Half of that would be 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers. We know that Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. 

To find the number of days, we can divide the total distance (20,000 kilometers) by the distance Alfie flies per day (400 kilometers). 

20,000 / 400 = 50 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of the 2nd fastest car first, and then use that to find the speed of the fastest car.

Given that the average car can go 120 miles per hour, and the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, we can calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car as follows:

Speed of 2nd fastest car = 5 * Speed of average car
= 5 * 120
= 600 miles per hour

Now, we know that the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. We can calculate the speed of the fastest car as follows:

Speed of fastest car = 1.25 * Speed of 2nd fastest car
= 1.25 * 600
= 750 miles per hour

The final answer is: 750"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Liam's age two years ago and then use that information to find Vince's age at that time. 

Liam's current age is 16 years. Two years ago, Liam's age would be 16 - 2 = 14 years.

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. So, Vince's age two years ago would be 14 / 2 = 7 years.

To find Vince's current age, we need to add 2 years to his age two years ago. Vince's current age is 7 + 2 = 9 years.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so let's call this number A.
- Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's call the number of eggs Sarah painted S. Then, Camden painted S + 12 eggs.
- Since Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, we can write the equation: S + (S + 12) = 30
- Simplifying the equation, we get 2S + 12 = 30
- Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get 2S = 18
- Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 9
- Since Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.
- Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, the total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline is 56 - 30 = 26. 
- Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, each of them painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.
- The difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold is 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we first need to find the total number of boxes and the total weight of the crayons and boxes.

Since Nik has 200 crayons and each box can hold 8 crayons, we can find the total number of boxes by dividing 200 by 8.

200 / 8 = 25

So, Nik will need 25 boxes.

Each box weighs 8 ounces, and there are 25 boxes, so the total weight of the boxes is 8 * 25 = 200 ounces.

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, and there are 200 crayons, so the total weight of the crayons is 1 * 200 = 200 ounces.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 200 ounces (boxes) + 200 ounces (crayons) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can find the total weight in pounds by dividing 400 by 16.

400 / 16 = 25

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much John makes, we first need to determine how many logs he can make from the tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we calculate 80% of 80 feet.

80% of 80 feet = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet long, we divide the total length of the usable tree by the length of each log to find out how many logs he can make.

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

From each log, he cuts 5 planks. So, we multiply the number of logs by the number of planks per log.

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

He sells each plank for $1.2. To find out how much he makes, we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the combined salary of Valerie and her brother, and then add her mother's salary to it.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, and her brother earns twice as much as her, so he earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

The combined salary of Valerie and her brother is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

The total amount of money they all have together is $15,000 + $30,000 = $45,000.

The final answer is: $45,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Grandma's speed on the beach and on the sidewalk. 

Let's denote Grandma's speed on the beach as 'x' miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. The time taken to walk 2 miles on the beach is 2/x, and the time taken to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is 1/(2x).

We are given that 40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach. This means that 2/x = 40/60 (converting 40 minutes to hours for consistency). 

Solving for x, we get x = 2/40 * 60 = 3 miles per minute.

Now that we know her speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk, which is 2x = 2 * 3 = 6 miles per minute.

The time taken to walk 2 miles on the beach is 2/3 = 40/60 minutes, and the time taken to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is 1/6 minutes.

The total time taken to complete the entire 3-mile walk is 40/60 + 1/6. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 60. 

40/60 + 10/60 = 50/60 = 5/6 hours. 

To convert 5/6 hours to minutes, we multiply by 60: 5/6 * 60 = 50 minutes.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take Jane to save a total of $60, we first need to calculate how much she has saved so far. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount saved is 4 * 8 = $32.

Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60. This is 60 - 32 = $28.

Since she saves $4 per week, we can find out how many weeks it will take her to save $28 by dividing 28 by 4. 

28 / 4 = 7.

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles and has 60 marbles, we need to find out how many marbles he had initially. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24.

So, if Bob receives 24 more marbles and has 60 marbles, we can set up an equation to find the initial number of marbles he had:

Initial marbles + 24 = 60

To find the initial number of marbles, we need to subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

Initial marbles = 60 - 24
Initial marbles = 36

Now that we know Bob had 36 marbles initially, we need to find out how many marbles he will have if he loses 10 marbles. To do this, we subtract 10 from the initial number of marbles:

36 - 10 = 26

So, Bob will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature of the second bottle of water. 

Let's denote the temperature of the second bottle as x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle into his water bottle, the total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces. 

Since the temperature of the mixture is at least 40 degrees, we can set up the following equation:

(33 * 4 + x * 1) / 5 >= 40

Simplifying the equation:

132 + x >= 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x >= 68

So, the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of cows. Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 21 days in three weeks. 

Number of cows added in three weeks = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of cows = Initial number of cows + Number of cows added
Total number of cows = 50 + 420
Total number of cows = 470

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens. Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. 

Number of chickens added in three weeks = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
Total number of chickens = Initial number of chickens + Number of chickens added
Total number of chickens = 20 + 210
Total number of chickens = 230

Now, let's add the total number of cows and chickens to find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks.

Total number of animals = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens
Total number of animals = 470 + 230
Total number of animals = 700

"To find the cost of each single bagel, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels with the 10% discount. 

The original cost of 4 packs of bagels is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00. 

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $40.00. 
10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the original cost to get the discounted cost: 
$40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Since each pack has 9 bagels, the total number of bagels is 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the discounted cost by the total number of bagels: 
$36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops, so we can write an equation:

Scoops = 23 - 5
Scoops = 18

Now, let's find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops, so we can write an equation:

Potatoes per scoop = (6 - 3) / (3 - 1)
Potatoes per scoop = 3 / 2
Potatoes per scoop = 1.5

Now that we know how many potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop, we can find out how many potatoes Gomer ate. We know that Gomer ate 18 scoops, so we can multiply the number of scoops by the number of potatoes per scoop:

Potatoes = Scoops * Potatoes per scoop
Potatoes = 18 * 1.5
Potatoes = 27

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days, and then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days is 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester increases his egg consumption to 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days is 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

Now, we add the total number of eggs from both periods: 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens: 240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen eggs.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to determine the total number of red and green jellybeans. We know there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans, so the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

The total number of green and red jellybeans is 17 + 34 = 51. Since there are a total of 60 jellybeans, the number of blue jellybeans can be found by subtracting the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans: 60 - 51 = 9.

First, let's find the total number of lemons he collects in one year. He has 5 trees and each tree gives him 6 lemons per year. 

Total lemons per year = Number of trees * Lemons per tree per year
Total lemons per year = 5 * 6
Total lemons per year = 30

Now, we multiply the total lemons per year by 10 to find the total lemons in a decade.

Total lemons in a decade = Total lemons per year * 10
Total lemons in a decade = 30 * 10
Total lemons in a decade = 300

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can let the number of men be 5x and the number of women be 9x. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the equation 5x + 9x = 84.

Combine like terms: 14x = 84

Divide both sides by 14: x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of women on the bus initially: 9x = 9 * 6 = 54

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining is: 54 - 20 = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many bouquets and sunflowers Faraday sold in a day. 

Let's start by finding out how many bouquets Faraday sold in a day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 from the bouquet per day, we can set up the equation:

8x = 56
x = 56 / 8
x = 7

So, Faraday sold 7 bouquets per day.

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers in a bouquet is 12. Therefore, the total number of sunflowers in 7 bouquets is:
7 * 12 = 84

Now, let's find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold in a day. Since he earned $26 from the sunflowers per day and each sunflower costs $2, we can set up the equation:

2x = 26
x = 26 / 2
x = 13

So, Faraday sold 13 sunflowers per day.

Now, we need to find out the total number of sunflowers Faraday sold in 3 days. We can multiply the number of sunflowers he sold in a day by 3:
13 * 3 = 39

Therefore, Faraday was able to sell 39 sunflowers after 3 days.

The final answer is: 39"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the inventory, the revenue from selling 60% of the inventory, and then find the difference between the revenue and the cost.

First, let's find out how many rocks Adam can buy with $100. 

Cost per rock = $5
Total money = $100
Number of rocks = Total money / Cost per rock
Number of rocks = 100 / 5
Number of rocks = 20

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling 60% of the inventory.

Revenue per rock = $7
Number of rocks sold = 60% of 20
Number of rocks sold = 0.6 * 20
Number of rocks sold = 12
Revenue = Number of rocks sold * Revenue per rock
Revenue = 12 * 7
Revenue = $84

Now, let's calculate the cost of the inventory.

Cost per rock = $5
Number of rocks = 20
Cost = Number of rocks * Cost per rock
Cost = 20 * 5
Cost = $100

Now, let's find the loss.

Loss = Cost - Revenue
Loss = 100 - 84
Loss = $16

The final answer is: $16"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene. 

First, let's find the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene:

- Large-sized picture scenes: 45 / 5 = 9 days
- Medium-sized picture scenes: 36 / 6 = 6 days
- Small-sized picture scenes: 49 / 7 = 7 days

Now, we need to find the LCM of 9, 6, and 7. 

The prime factorization of 6 is 2 * 3.
The prime factorization of 7 is 7.
The prime factorization of 9 is 3^2.

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:
- The highest power of 2 is 2^1 (from 6).
- The highest power of 3 is 3^2 (from 9).
- The highest power of 7 is 7^1 (from 7).

The LCM is 2^1 * 3^2 * 7^1 = 2 * 9 * 7 = 126.

Therefore, it will take Lauren 126 days to complete all the picture scenes.

The final answer is: 126"
"To find out how many eggs each child receives, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. 

First, let's determine the total number of eggs. Chatty prepared three dozen eggs. Since one dozen is equal to 12, three dozen is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. There are four children. 

36 eggs / 4 children = 9 eggs per child.

"To find out how much Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to calculate the total cost of food for a month. 

First, we need to determine the number of days in May. May has 31 days. 

Since each fish needs $1 worth of food a day, and Jen has 3 fish, the daily cost of food for all her fish is 3 * $1 = $3.

To find the total cost for the month, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days in May: $3 * 31 = $93.

So, Jen spends $93 on food for her fish in May.

The final answer is: $93"
"To find out how many roses Patricia has now, we need to first determine how many roses she had after giving some to her mother. 

Initially, Patricia had 30 roses. She gave 24 roses to her mother, so we subtract 24 from 30 to find out how many roses she had left: 30 - 24 = 6.

Then, Patricia bought 15 more roses. To find the total number of roses she has now, we add the 15 new roses to the 6 she had left: 6 + 15 = 21.

So, Patricia now has 21 roses.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken. 

The total distance traveled is 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles.

The total time taken is 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

The average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time: average speed = total distance / total time = 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning. 

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which is 0.2 in decimal form. The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 times 0.2, which is 0.6.

Now, we multiply the probabilities of both tickets winning: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many seashells Carrey collected. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as 'x'. Then, the number of seashells Carlos collected is 2x.

We are given that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, we can write an equation:

27 = 2x + 5

To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate it. Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:

22 = 2x

Now, divide both sides by 2:

x = 11

So, Carrey collected 11 seashells. Now that we know the number of seashells each person collected, we can find the total number of seashells:

Total seashells = 11 + 22 + 27 = 60

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, we need to divide the total number of seashells by 3:

60 / 3 = 20

Each person got 20 seashells.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and add the number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday). So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 + 5 = 10.

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week: 20 + 10 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. Since the second song is 60% longer than the first song, we can calculate its length by adding 60% of the first song's length to the first song's length.

First, we need to convert 60% to a decimal: 60% = 0.6

Now, we can calculate the length of the second song: 
Length of the second song = Length of the first song + (0.6 * Length of the first song)
= 5 + (0.6 * 5)
= 5 + 3
= 8 minutes

Now, we can find the total time of the cassette by adding the lengths of both songs:
Total time = Length of the first song + Length of the second song
= 5 + 8
= 13 minutes

"To find the total profit, we first need to calculate the profit from each device and then multiply it by the total number of devices sold.

Linus buys a mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice the amount, which is $40. The profit from each device is $40 - $20 = $20.

He bought 2 devices last Monday, so the profit from Monday's sales is 2 * $20 = $40.

He bought 4 devices last Tuesday, so the profit from Tuesday's sales is 4 * $20 = $80.

The total profit is the sum of the profit from Monday and Tuesday's sales, which is $40 + $80 = $120.

The final numerical answer is: $120"
"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to determine Carl's height first. We know that Isabel is 7 feet tall and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel. 

Isabel's height = 7 feet
Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
Ned's height = 7 - 2
Ned's height = 5 feet

Since Carl is one foot taller than Ned, we can calculate Carl's height as follows:
Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 + 1
Carl's height = 6 feet

We are given that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. To find the length of the cane, we can divide Carl's height by 2:
Cane's length = Carl's height / 2
Cane's length = 6 / 2
Cane's length = 3 feet

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many bottles are required to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people. 

First, let's find out how many bottles are required to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of one person. Since each bottle covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand, we need 100% / 20% = 5 bottles to cover 100% of one person's daily energy needs.

Now, we need to find out how many bottles are required to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people. We multiply the number of bottles required for one person by 2300: 5 bottles/person * 2300 people = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles it needs to produce to meet the demand of 11500 bottles. We subtract the production capacity from the required number of bottles: 11500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 7300 bottles.

The final answer is: 7300"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how many babies are wearing purple and blue. Since Carla has 8 babies and 3/4 of them are wearing purple, we can calculate the number of purple babies as follows:

Number of purple babies = 8 * (3/4) = 6

Similarly, the number of blue babies is:

Number of blue babies = 8 * (1/4) = 2

Now, let's find out how many babies are wearing bows. We know that all the blue babies and 1/3 of the purple babies are wearing bows. So, the number of purple babies wearing bows is:

Number of purple babies wearing bows = 6 * (1/3) = 2

The total number of babies wearing bows is the sum of blue babies and purple babies wearing bows:

Total number of babies wearing bows = 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4

Now, we need to find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. To do this, we'll divide the number of purple babies wearing bows by the total number of babies wearing bows and multiply by 100:

Percentage chance = (2 / 4) * 100 = 50%

"To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday, and then subtract that result from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports received last week = 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

First, let's find the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday. 

Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Now, let's find the total number of reports received on Wednesday by subtracting the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday. However, we need to subtract the reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received last week to get the reports received on Wednesday.

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received last week - (Reports received on Monday and Tuesday + Reports received on Thursday and Friday)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Reports received on Wednesday = 1125

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much land Abraham sold in the first two transactions. He initially had 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it for $50, which means he sold 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. 

After that, he sold another 1/4 of his land, which is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters. So, in total, he sold 40 + 20 = 60 square meters in the first two transactions.

This means he has 80 - 60 = 20 square meters of land left.

Now, he sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, the amount of money he earned from selling the remaining land is 20 * 3 = $60.

In the first two transactions, he earned $50 + $30 = $80.

Therefore, the total amount of money he will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is $80 + $60 = $140.

"To find Geb's age, we need to first find half of Haley's age. Haley is 26 years old, so half of her age is 26 / 2 = 13. 

Since Geb is 10 less than half of Haley's age, we subtract 10 from 13. 

13 - 10 = 3.

Geb is 3 years old."
"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to first determine how many face masks he uses in a day. Since he changes his face mask two times every time he goes out and he goes out three times a day, we can multiply the number of times he goes out by the number of face masks he uses each time.

Number of face masks used per day = 2 (face masks per outing) * 3 (outings per day) = 6 face masks per day

Now, to find out how many face masks he uses every 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks used per day by 2.

Number of face masks used every 2 days = 6 face masks per day * 2 days = 12 face masks

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many eggs each person found and then subtract that from the total number of eggs hidden.

Lamar finds 5 eggs. 
Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.
Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by each person: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

There were originally 3 dozen eggs hidden, which is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

To find out how many eggs are still hidden, we subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To find the total amount John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments in each complex and then multiply it by the number of collections per week and the payment per collection.

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so the total number of apartments in these two complexes is 200 + 200 = 400.

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, which means it is 160% of 400 (100% of 400 + 60% of 400). To find 160% of 400, we multiply 400 by 1.6 (which is the decimal form of 160%): 400 * 1.6 = 640.

So, the total number of apartments in all three complexes is 400 + 640 = 1040.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections per week is 3 * 1040 = 3120.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so the total amount he makes in a week is 3120 * $0.40 = $1248.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree in each year and then sum them up.

In the 5th year, the tree produces 50 fruits.
In the 6th year, it produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
In the 7th year, it produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
In the 8th year, it produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, but we don't know the production of a 10-year-old tree yet. We'll come back to this later.
In the 9th year, the tree doesn't produce any fruits.
In the 10th year, a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, let's find out how many fruits a 10-year-old tree produces in the 8th year. Since a 10-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree in the 8th year, it means a 10-year-old tree in the 8th year produces 1000 + 200 = 1200 fruits. 

So, in the 8th year, the tree produces 1200 fruits.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree in its 10 years of life:
Year 5: 50 fruits
Year 6: 150 fruits
Year 7: 350 fruits
Year 8: 1200 fruits
Year 9: 0 fruits
Year 10: 1000 fruits

"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R. We are given that:

1. R = 4B (red rope is four times the length of the blue rope)
2. B = Y - 7 (blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope)
3. R + B + Y = 37 (the 3 ropes have a combined length of 37 centimeters)

We can substitute the first equation into the third equation to get:
4B + B + Y = 37
Combine like terms:
5B + Y = 37

Now, substitute the second equation into the above equation:
5(B) + (Y - 7) = 37
Expand the equation:
5B + Y - 7 = 37
Add 7 to both sides:
5B + Y = 44

Now we have two equations:
1. 5B + Y = 44
2. B = Y - 7

Substitute the second equation into the first equation:
5(Y - 7) + Y = 44
Expand the equation:
5Y - 35 + Y = 44
Combine like terms:
6Y - 35 = 44
Add 35 to both sides:
6Y = 79
Divide both sides by 6:
Y = 13.17

Now that we have the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
B = Y - 7
B = 13.17 - 7
B = 6.17

Now that we have the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope:
R = 4B
R = 4 * 6.17
R = 24.68

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume Ronnie was given $5. Since Rissa was given thrice as much, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

After each of them gave an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's call the amount they gave 'x'. So, Ronnie is left with 5 - x and Rissa is left with 15 - x.

We are given that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. This means 15 - x = (4/5) * 15.

To find the value of x, we can solve the equation: 
15 - x = (4/5) * 15
15 - x = 12
x = 3

Now that we know x, we can find out how much money Ronnie is left with:
Ronnie's money left = 5 - x

"Let's break down the information given. We know that there are four colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow. We also know that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint. Let's denote the amount of each of these colors as x. 

Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and we know that the yellow paint is 6 pints. So, the total amount of red, white, and purple paint is 12 - 6 = 6 pints.

Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can set up the equation: x + x + x = 6. This simplifies to 3x = 6.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 6 / 3 = 2.

Since x represents the amount of each of the colors red, white, and purple, the amount of red paint used is x = 2 pints.

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, then add them together.

First, let's find the area of one bedroom: 
Area of one bedroom = length * width = 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms = 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area = 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas together: 
Total area = area of bedrooms + area of living room + area of the rest of the house
Total area = 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

20% of 100 is 0.2 * 100 = 20. 
So, the new box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Since each pod costs $0.12 (12 dollars for 100 pods), the cost per pod is $0.12.

Now, we need to find out how many pods can be bought for $1. 
$1 / $0.12 = 8.3333 (round down to 8, since you can't buy a fraction of a pod).

However, we need to find out how many cycles can be run with the new box for $1. 
Since the new box has 120 pods, we can run 120 / 8 = 15 cycles for $1."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. This means he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he is left with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which is 40 / 2 = 20 bills. So, he is left with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

Thomas then triples his money, which means he triples the number of bills. So, he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since each bill is now worth 5 dollars, the total amount of money he has is 60 * 5 = 300 dollars.

Since each bill is worth 5 dollars, the number of 5 dollar bills he has is 300 / 5 = 60.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals.

Now, let's find out how many goals team A scored in the second half. It's given that team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half. Since team B scored 8 goals in the second half, team A scored 8 * 1/4 = 2 goals in the second half.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team in the match. Team A scored 4 goals in the first half and 2 goals in the second half, for a total of 4 + 2 = 6 goals. Team B scored 2 goals in the first half and 8 goals in the second half, for a total of 2 + 8 = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by both teams, which is 6 + 10 = 16.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much chalk the teacher has left after Monday and then determine how many days it will last.

The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. He uses 45% of it on Monday, so we need to find 45% of 5 inches.

45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

This means the teacher has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk left after Monday.

Now, we need to find out how many days the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk will last when the teacher uses 20% of it each day.

Let's assume the number of days the chalk will last is 'x'. Then, 20% of 2.75 inches will be used each day.

0.20 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches per day

Since the teacher starts with 2.75 inches, we can set up the equation:

2.75 = 0.55x

To solve for 'x', we divide both sides by 0.55:

x = 2.75 / 0.55
x = 5

The total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

Since there are 24 students in total (12 boys and 12 girls), the number of students not on varsity is 24 - 7 = 17.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find out how many face masks Johnny bought, we need to first determine how many face masks Mike bought, and then calculate three times that amount and add 2.

Mike bought 5 face masks. 

Three times the number of face masks Mike bought is 3 * 5 = 15.

Johnny bought 2 more than three times as many as Mike, so we add 2 to 15: 15 + 2 = 17.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we first need to determine the total number of teeth the dentist worked on. The dentist drilled 4 teeth and capped 7 more than he drilled, so the number of teeth capped is 4 + 7 = 11.

The total number of teeth the dentist worked on is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15.

To find the percentage of teeth the dentist fixed, we divide the number of teeth worked on by the total number of teeth James has and multiply by 100.

(15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total cost of the milk that Mr. Marcellus purchased, we need to multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon. 

Total gallons = 4000
Cost per gallon = $3.5

Total cost = Total gallons * Cost per gallon
Total cost = 4000 * 3.5
Total cost = $14,000

Since 2/5 of the milk was expired, we need to find 2/5 of the total gallons to determine the amount that was returned.

Expired gallons = 2/5 * Total gallons
Expired gallons = 2/5 * 4000
Expired gallons = 1600

The refund amount will be the cost of the expired gallons.

Refund amount = Expired gallons * Cost per gallon
Refund amount = 1600 * 3.5
Refund amount = $5600

The final answer is: $5600"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Colin's current age as C and Wendy's current age as W.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:
20 = C

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we first need to determine the total number of books he can buy with $27000. 

Since he can buy 100 books for $500, we can find the total number of books he can buy by dividing the total amount he has ($27000) by the cost of 100 books ($500).

Total number of books = $27000 / $500 = 54

Now, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books he can buy per school.

Books per school = Total number of books / Number of schools
= 54 / 3
= 18

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's break down the events step by step:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree. Newton picked up 2 apples, so he had 2 in his hand.
2. He put 1 apple in his pocket, leaving 1 apple in his hand. Then, he threw the apple in his hand into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 5 apples in his hand and 1 in his pocket.
3. He put all but 1 of the 5 apples in his hand into his pocket, leaving 1 apple in his hand. So, he has 1 apple in his hand and 6 apples in his pocket (1 from the previous step + 5 new ones).
4. He threw the apple in his hand at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 6 apples in his hand and 6 apples in his pocket.
5. He picked up all the remaining apples, which are the 6 apples in his hand and the 6 apples that fell out of the tree. So, he has a total of 12 apples.

"To find the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to calculate the total number of bags and then multiply it by the cost per bag.

First, let's find the total number of bags: 
Total coal ordered = 850 kg
Weight of each bag = 50 kg
Number of bags = Total coal ordered / Weight of each bag
Number of bags = 850 / 50
Number of bags = 17

Now, let's find the total cost:
Cost per bag = $18
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 17 * 18
Total cost = 306

The final answer is: $306"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza that Kate's friends will eat, and then determine the total number of slices needed. 

First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten by Kate's friends: 
6 friends * 6 slices per friend = 36 slices

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten by Kate's friends: 
6 friends * 4 slices per friend = 24 slices

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to find out how many whole pizzas are needed for each type. 

For the cheese pizza: 
36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas

For the pepperoni pizza: 
24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas

Since Kate needs to buy whole pizzas, she needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas. 

To find the total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we add the number of cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas: 
3 cheese pizzas + 3 pepperoni pizzas = 6 pizzas

"To find the total miles Sam ran this week, we need to calculate the miles run on each day and add them up.

On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. So, the total miles run on these days is 3 * 3 = 9 miles.

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. So, the total miles run on these days is 5 * 2 = 10 miles.

Now, let's add the miles run on both sets of days: 9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the net rate at which Jay is building snowballs. He builds 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. 

First, let's convert the melting rate to an hourly rate. Since there are 4 15-minute intervals in an hour, the melting rate is 2 * 4 = 8 snowballs per hour.

Now, let's find the net rate at which Jay is building snowballs. This is the rate at which he builds snowballs minus the rate at which they melt: 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs per hour.

To find the time it takes for Jay to have 60 snowballs, we can divide the target number of snowballs by the net rate: 60 / 12 = 5 hours.

However, this is the time it takes to build 60 snowballs, but it doesn't account for the initial 0 snowballs Jay has. Since he starts with 0 snowballs, he needs to build 60 snowballs, which takes 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how old Jim was 20 years ago, when Digimon first came out. Since John is 28 now, we can subtract 20 from his current age to find his age at that time.

John's age 20 years ago = 28 - 20 = 8

Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we can set up an equation to find Jim's age at that time:

John's age 20 years ago = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago
8 = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago

To find Jim's age 20 years ago, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Jim's age 20 years ago = 8 / 2
Jim's age 20 years ago = 4

Now, to find Jim's current age, we add 20 to his age 20 years ago:

Jim's current age = Jim's age 20 years ago + 20
Jim's current age = 4 + 20
Jim's current age = 24

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Doxa ate 1 slice of the apple. 
Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, let's add up the number of slices each of them ate: 
Doxa ate 1 slice, her sister ate 2 slices, and her brother ate 3 slices. 
So, the total number of slices they ate is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as 'x'. 

On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50. So, the remaining bandages after the first day are x - 38.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The remaining bandages after the second day are (x - 38) - 28.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. The remaining bandages after the third day are ((x - 38) - 28) - 25 + 100.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation:

((x - 38) - 28) - 25 + 100 = 78

Simplifying the equation:

x - 38 - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78
x - 91 + 100 = 78
x + 9 = 78
x = 69

"To find the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut and the cost of the color separately and then add them together.

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, and May's hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches. So, the length of hair cut is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

The cost of the haircut is 2 inches * $30 per inch = $60.

The cost of the color is $40.

The total cost is $60 (haircut) + $40 (color) = $100.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her total hours worked and her total attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her total hours worked in April. Since she works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week, and there are 4 weeks in April, we can calculate her total hours worked as follows:

Total hours worked = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks
Total hours worked = 180 hours

Next, let's calculate her total earnings from her hourly rate. Her hourly rate is $1.5, so we can multiply her total hours worked by her hourly rate:

Total earnings from hourly rate = 180 hours * $1.5/hour
Total earnings from hourly rate = $270

Now, let's calculate her total attendance bonus. Since she has complete attendance for the month, she receives an additional $10 for each day she works. There are 6 days in a week, and she works 4 weeks, so she works a total of 24 days in April. However, we need to calculate her total attendance bonus for the month, not the week. Since she has complete attendance for the month, she receives the attendance bonus for all 30 days in April (4 weeks * 7 days/week). 

Total attendance bonus = $10/day * 30 days
Total attendance bonus = $300

Now, let's calculate her total earnings for April by adding her total earnings from her hourly rate and her total attendance bonus:

Total earnings = Total earnings from hourly rate + Total attendance bonus
Total earnings = $270 + $300
Total earnings = $570

The final answer is: $570"
"To find out how much money Jason earned, we need to calculate the total amount he earned from each task and then add them up.

For the two-week period, Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times, so he earned 6 * $0.50 = $3.00 from emptying the dishwasher.

He did his laundry once, so he earned $3.00 from doing his laundry.

He took the trash out twice, so he earned 2 * $0.75 = $1.50 from taking the trash out.

He cleaned his room once, so he earned $1.50 from cleaning his room.

Now, let's add up the total amount Jason earned: $3.00 (dishwasher) + $3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (trash) + $1.50 (room) = $8.00

Then, 40 more people entered at 10:00. 
Next, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. 
Finally, 3 times as many people as the number that came in first (50) entered by evening, which is 3 * 50 = 150 people.

Now, let's add up the number of people who entered at each time: 
50 (morning) + 40 (10:00) + 80 (lunch) + 150 (evening) = 320

The total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we first need to determine the number of red pens and black pens. 

Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack has 5 pens. So, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

Since Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens, the number of black pens is 2 * 25 = 50.

To find the total number of pens Alain has, we add the number of red pens and black pens: 25 (red pens) + 50 (black pens) = 75 pens.

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately, and then add them together.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles, so the cost per bottle is $600 / 10 = $60.

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of the cognac is 50% more than the scotch, so the cost per bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $90.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is the sum of the cost of the scotch and the cognac: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. He also planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which means he planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it a total of 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day. Since he planted 40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day, 1/4 of that is 40 * 1/4 = 10. So, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

To find the total number of trees planted in the two days, we need to add the number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees planted on both days. 

Total White Oak trees = 20 (first day) + 10 (second day) = 30
Total Lodgepole Pine trees = 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90

Total number of trees = Total White Oak trees + Total Lodgepole Pine trees = 30 + 90 = 120

"To find out how much root beer was available for each person to drink, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer left after all the incidents. 

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer. 

On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed by his children. So, the remaining amount is 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled. So, the remaining amount is 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.

On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed by Ronnie. So, the remaining amount is 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, and they shared the remaining root beer equally. To find out how much each person got, we need to divide the remaining amount by the number of people. 

8 gallons / 3 people = 2.67 gallons per person.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as 'x'. 

The problem states that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as an equation: 4x + 8 = 40.

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable 'x'. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation: 4x = 40 - 8.

This simplifies to: 4x = 32.

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for 'x': x = 32 / 4.

x = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we first need to calculate one-third of the total number of fish. 

One-third of 66 is 66 / 3 = 22.

Now, we know that 22 fish have red stripes. To find the number of remaining fish, we subtract the number of fish with red stripes from the total number of fish.

Remaining fish = Total fish - Fish with red stripes
Remaining fish = 66 - 22
Remaining fish = 44

Now, we need to find the number of fish with blue stripes, which is 5/11 of the remaining fish.

Number of fish with blue stripes = (5/11) * Remaining fish
Number of fish with blue stripes = (5/11) * 44
Number of fish with blue stripes = 20

Now, we need to find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes. We already know that 22 fish have red stripes, and 20 fish have blue stripes. However, we need to be careful not to double-count the fish that have both red and blue stripes. Since the problem doesn't mention any fish with both red and blue stripes, we can simply add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes.

Total number of fish with red and blue stripes = Fish with red stripes + Fish with blue stripes
Total number of fish with red and blue stripes = 22 + 20
Total number of fish with red and blue stripes = 42

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Amy had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors from the palettes.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 eyeshadow colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister stole one of the palettes, which means Amy lost 4 eyeshadow colors (since each palette has 4 colors).

Now, Amy has 26 - 4 = 22 eyeshadow colors left.

Amy then uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set has 6 eyeshadow colors, half of that is 6 / 2 = 3 eyeshadow colors.

So, Amy uses up 3 eyeshadow colors from the makeup set.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know Mattison's height is 60 inches. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is, so the total height of the two-story house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

Since the first floor's floor to ceiling height is thrice as high as Mattison's height, the first floor's height is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Now, to find the height of the second floor, we subtract the first floor's height from the total height of the two-story house: 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is the same as the height of the first floor, which is 180 inches.

"To find the number of shells found by team Alphas, we need to calculate 40% of 700. 

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells remaining after team Alphas found their share. 

Remaining shells = Total shells - Shells found by Alphas
= 700 - 280
= 420 shells.

Next, we need to find the number of shells found by team The finders, which is 60% of the remaining shells.

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells found by team Gogetters. This is the remaining shells after team The finders found their share.

"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first find the selling price of the magazines. 

The cost price of the magazines is $72. Trinity sells the magazines at 11/8 of the cost price. 

To find the selling price, we multiply the cost price by 11/8:
Selling price = (11/8) * 72
Selling price = (11 * 72) / 8
Selling price = 792 / 8
Selling price = 99

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:

"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed by each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed by the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed by the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total amount of water removed by the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, we add the total amount of water removed by each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we first need to determine the capacity of John's school. 

Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we can find the capacity of one of John's classes by multiplying Ali's class capacity by 1/8.

Capacity of one of John's classes = 120 * (1/8) = 15 students

Since John has two classes, we multiply the capacity of one class by 2 to find the total capacity of John's school.

Capacity of John's school = 15 * 2 = 30 students

Now, we add the capacity of Ali's school (which is 120 students) to the capacity of John's school to find the combined capacity of both schools.

Combined capacity = 120 + 30 = 150

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total interest Stephen owes his sister and then subtract the total amount he paid in the 11 months from the total amount he borrowed plus the interest.

First, let's calculate the total interest Stephen owes his sister. The interest is 2% of the $300 he borrowed, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

Now, let's calculate the total amount Stephen will pay in the 11 months. He will pay $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount he will pay in the 11 months is 25 * 11 = $275.

The total amount Stephen owes his sister, including the interest, is $300 + $6 = $306.

Now, let's calculate the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month. This is the total amount he owes, minus the total amount he paid in the 11 months: $306 - $275 = $31.

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, we need to find out how many diapers she changes. Half of 10 is 5, so Jordan's wife changes 5 diapers per day.

To find out how many diapers Jordan changes, we subtract the number of diapers his wife changes from the total number of diaper changes. So, 10 - 5 = 5.

Therefore, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we first need to calculate the volume of the jar. The jar has a square base with a side length of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the jar) is given by the formula V = lwh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.

Given that the base is square, the length and width are the same, so we can use the formula V = s^2h, where s is the side length of the square base.

V = s^2h
V = 6^2 * 15
V = 36 * 15
V = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, we need to divide the volume of the jar by 0.8 to get the total volume that can be occupied by the jelly beans.

Total volume for jelly beans = 540 / 0.8
Total volume for jelly beans = 675 cubic inches

Since each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, we can divide the total volume for jelly beans by the volume of a single jelly bean to get the total number of jelly beans.

Total number of jelly beans = 675 / 0.15
Total number of jelly beans = 4500

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3 to get the number of red jelly beans.

Number of red jelly beans = 4500 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 1350

However, we are given that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we need to know what his guess was. Since we don't have that information, we can't calculate the exact difference. 

However, we can calculate the ratio of the true number of red jelly beans to the estimated number of red jelly beans. 

Ratio = True number of red jelly beans / Estimated number of red jelly beans
Ratio = 900 / 1350
Ratio = 0.6667

This means that Tim's guess was 1/1.5 or 2/3 of the true number of red jelly beans.

The final answer is: $\boxed{600}$"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. 

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first stop, 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered at the second stop. So, the total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the remaining spaces, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of visits for the first 5 years and the total cost of visits for the next 3 years.

For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit is $2. Since Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, the annual cost is 3 * $2 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 5 * $6 = $30.

The cost of one visit increases by 150% after 5 years. A 150% increase means the new cost is 2.5 times the original cost. So, the new cost of one visit is $2 * 2.5 = $5.

For the next 3 years, the annual cost is 3 * $5 = $15. For 3 years, the total cost is 3 * $15 = $45.

The total cost of all visits is the sum of the cost for the first 5 years and the cost for the next 3 years: $30 + $45 = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To find out how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to determine the total number of groups required and then multiply that by the time it takes for each group to try the escape room.

There are 4 grades (4-7) with 10 students in each grade, so the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40.

Since only the top 10 students in each grade get to try the escape room, we need to find the total number of students who will try the escape room. Since there are 4 grades, we need to find the total number of students who will try the escape room in each grade, which is 10 students per grade. So, the total number of students who will try the escape room is 4 * 10 = 40.

However, only 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students who will try the escape room by 8: 40 / 8 = 5.

Since each group uses their full 45 minutes, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is the number of groups multiplied by the time per group: 5 * 45 = 225 minutes.

The final answer is: 225"
"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the wooden tables and the roof frames separately and then add them together.

The cost of the wooden tables is 4 tables * $20 per table = $80.
The cost of the roof frames is 2 frames * $10 per frame = $20.

Now, we add the cost of the tables and the roof frames together: $80 + $20 = $100.

The final numerical answer is: $100"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length can be represented as 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet. We can write this as an equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Now, divide both sides by 5 to solve for x:

x = 8

Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length is 4x:

Longer piece = 4x = 4(8) = 32

The final answer is: 32"
"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he'll need to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound to find the total pounds of meat needed.

Total meatballs needed: 80
Meatballs per pound: 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Now that we know Aiden needs 5 pounds of ground beef, we can find out how much seasoning he'll need. He uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat.

Total pounds of meat needed: 5
Seasoning per pound: 2 tablespoons

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat needed * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2
Total seasoning needed = 10

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning to make 80 meatballs.

"To find the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the width of one window by the total number of windows. 

Width of one window: 35 inches
Number of windows: 5

Total width of windows = 35 inches/window * 5 windows = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2.

Fabric needed = 2 * 175 inches = 350 inches

The final answer is: 350"
"To find the total cost of the call, we need to calculate the cost for the first 16 minutes and the cost for the remaining minutes. 

The cost for the first 16 minutes is 16 * $0.25 = $4.

"To find the total inches of rain on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the amount of rain that fell on Monday, which is given as 2 inches. 

Next, we need to find twice the total amount of rain that fell on Monday. Twice of 2 inches is 2 * 2 = 4 inches.

It is expected to rain 1 more inch than twice of Monday's total, so we add 1 inch to the result from the previous step. 4 + 1 = 5 inches.

Therefore, the total amount of rain expected on Tuesday is 5 inches.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given. Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. If we let the number of cupcakes be 'c', then the number of brownies is 3c - 2.

We know that each person gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. So, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, which is c + (3c - 2) = 4c - 2.

Since the total number of treats is 10, we can set up the equation 4c - 2 = 10.

To solve for c, we add 2 to both sides of the equation: 4c = 12.

Then, we divide both sides by 4: c = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure. 

The original price of the manicure is $35 and the pedicure is $40. The total price for both is $35 + $40 = $75. 

Since there's a 20% discount, we need to find 20% of $75. To do this, we multiply $75 by 0.20, which equals $15. 

Now, we subtract the discount from the total price: $75 - $15 = $60. 

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the nail art. Since there are 10 fingers (2 hands * 5 fingers per hand), and each nail costs $3, the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

Finally, we add the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art: $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the total number of magazines Susan receives each year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them up.

The first 3 magazines send 12 issues a year, so that's 3 * 12 = 36 issues.

The second magazine sends 6 issues a year.

The third magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, which is 4 * 6 = 24 issues.

Now, let's add up the total number of issues: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

So, Susan receives 66 magazines every year.

The final answer is: 66"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that Samantha has 27 paintings and she has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. This means Shelley has 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.

We also know that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. To find out how many paintings Kim has, we need to subtract 8 from Shelley's total number of paintings. 

So, Kim has 39 - 8 = 31 paintings.

"To find the price of the toy after the discount in January, we need to follow the given changes in price.

Initially, the price of the toy was $40.

In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we multiply the initial price by 1.8 (100% + 80% = 180%, or 1 + 0.8 = 1.8).

New price in December = $40 * 1.8 = $72

In January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we multiply the price in December by 0.5 (100% - 50% = 50%, or 1 - 0.5 = 0.5).

New price in January = $72 * 0.5 = $36

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the income from the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons separately and then add them together.

For the standard rate lessons, Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 per hour. So, the total income from standard rate lessons is 4 * $80 = $320.

For the reduced rate lessons, Charlie has 2 lessons at a 25% discount. This means the reduced rate is 75% of the standard rate, which is 0.75 * $80 = $60 per hour. So, the total income from reduced rate lessons is 2 * $60 = $120.

Now, we add the income from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day: $320 + $120 = $440.

The final answer is: $440"
"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of scores.

First, let's add up all the scores: 
50 + 80 = 130

210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

The sum of all the scores is 630.

Next, we need to count the total number of scores, which is 9.

Now, we divide the sum of the scores by the total number of scores to find the mean:

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pomelos Eve gave away. Let's start by identifying the information given:

- Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos.
- After giving some away, she is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had.

Since Eve is left with 1/4 of the original amount, we can set up an equation to find out how many pomelos she gave away. Let's denote the number of pomelos she gave away as 'x'. 

The equation can be set up as follows:

Original amount - Given away = Remaining amount
20 - x = (1/4) * 20

Simplifying the equation:
20 - x = 5

To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 20 from both sides:
-x = 5 - 20
-x = -15

Multiply both sides by -1 to solve for 'x':
x = 15

So, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total amount of money Walter received, we need to calculate the number of apples he had left after eating and giving some to his sister, and then multiply that by the price per apple.

First, Walter ate 2/5 of the 60 apples. To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and divide by 5:
60 * 2 = 120
120 / 5 = 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, we subtract 24 from the total number of apples to find the remaining number:
60 - 24 = 36

Walter then gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. To find 25% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.25:
36 * 0.25 = 9

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples. Now, we subtract 9 from the remaining number to find the final number of apples:
36 - 9 = 27

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find the total amount of money he received, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple:
27 * 3 = 81

"To find the total number of novels Regina wrote this year, we need to determine the whole from the given fraction. Since 9 novels is 3 quarters of the total, we can set up an equation to solve for the total.

Let x be the total number of novels written this year. The equation is:

9 = (3/4)x

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 4/3:

x = 9 * (4/3)
x = 12

So, Regina wrote 12 novels this year.

"To find the total distance covered by Michael in 3 days, we need to calculate the distance he travels in one day and then multiply it by 3.

First, let's convert the speed from km/hr to km/day. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply 50 km/hr by 24 hours to get the distance covered in a day:

50 km/hr * 24 hr/day = 1200 km/day

Now, we multiply the daily distance by 3 to get the total distance covered in 3 days:

1200 km/day * 3 days = 3600 km

Now, we need to find the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered. To do this, we divide the distance covered by Michael by the total distance between Alaska and Texas, and then multiply by 100:

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many grapes were used by Madeline's brother and her mother, and then subtract that from the total number of grapes Madeline ate.

Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the total number of grapes used by her mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and her mother is 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

To find the initial number of grapes, we need to add the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and her mother to the grapes used by her mother to make the pies. However, since the grapes used by her mother are already included in the total, we only need to add the grapes used by Madeline and her brother. The initial number of grapes is 84 + 6 = 90.

"To find the total number of classrooms the custodian needs to clean, we already know that number is 80. 

The custodian has 5 days to clean the classrooms. We need to find out how many minutes they have to clean in total. Since they work 8 hours a day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, they work 8 * 60 = 480 minutes per day.

In 5 days, they work a total of 5 * 480 = 2400 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes they spend cleaning per classroom. It takes them 15 minutes per classroom.

To find the total time spent cleaning, we multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom: 80 * 15 = 1200 minutes.

Now, we need to find the percentage of their day spent cleaning. To do this, we divide the total time spent cleaning by the total time available and multiply by 100: (1200 / 2400) * 100 = 50%.

"To solve this problem, let's first determine the capacity of each shelf. 

Let's denote the capacity of a middle shelf as 'm'. Since the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, its capacity is 2m. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so its capacity is 2m - 5.

We know that each of the middle shelves can hold 10 books. Therefore, m = 10.

Now, we can calculate the capacity of the bottom and top shelves:
- Bottom shelf: 2m = 2 * 10 = 20 books
- Top shelf: 2m - 5 = 2 * 10 - 5 = 15 books

The total capacity of the three shelves in one bookcase is 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to find out how many bookcases she needs to hold all of them. 

To do this, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase: 110 / 55 = 2.

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B. We know that B = 5S - 4.

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, which is the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes. So, we can write the equation: S + B = 116.

Substituting the expression for B from the first equation into the second equation, we get: S + (5S - 4) = 116.

Combine like terms: 6S - 4 = 116.

Add 4 to both sides: 6S = 120.

Divide both sides by 6: S = 20.

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting S into the equation B = 5S - 4: B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the family, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Next, let's calculate the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of 8 rooms is 4 rooms. So, 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, which is 4 * 4 = 16 small candles. The other 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each, which is 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles. 

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Now, let's divide the total hours Tim spends at work by the time it takes to deal with a call: 6 hours / 0.25 hours per call = 24 calls per day.

Since Tim works for 5 days a week, we multiply the number of calls he deals with in a day by the number of days he works: 24 calls per day * 5 days per week = 120 calls per week.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total time it takes for the coat of varnish to dry on 6 paintings with the old varnish, we multiply the time it takes for one painting by the number of paintings: 7 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 42 minutes.

To find the total time it takes for the coat of varnish to dry on 6 paintings with the new varnish, we multiply the time it takes for one painting by the number of paintings: 12 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 72 minutes.

Now, we need to find the difference in time between the two scenarios. We subtract the time it takes with the old varnish from the time it takes with the new varnish: 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total amount of water Crista needs, we need to calculate the water required for each type of plant and add them together.

4 plants need half a cup of water each, so the total water for these plants is 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups.

8 plants need 1 cup of water each, so the total water for these plants is 8 * 1 = 8 cups.

The rest of the plants are 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 plants. These plants need a quarter of a cup of water each, so the total water for these plants is 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.

Now, we add the water required for all the plants together: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it takes for Phineas to cover the distance on land and in water separately, and then add them together.

Since Phineas needs to cover 200 yards, half of the distance is 100 yards on land and the other half is also 100 yards in water.

Time taken to cover 100 yards on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute is:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 100 yards / 20 yards/minute
Time = 5 minutes

Time taken to cover 100 yards in water at a speed of 10 yards per minute is:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 100 yards / 10 yards/minute
Time = 10 minutes

Total time taken to return home is the sum of the time taken on land and in water:
Total Time = Time on land + Time in water
Total Time = 5 minutes + 10 minutes
Total Time = 15 minutes

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total cost, we first need to determine how many boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs to buy. Since he needs 56 popsicle sticks and each box contains 8 sticks, we can divide 56 by 8 to find the number of boxes needed.

56 Ã· 8 = 7

So, Bob needs 7 boxes of popsicle sticks. Each box costs $2.00, so we can multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box to find the total cost.

7 boxes * $2.00 per box = $14.00

Therefore, it will cost Bob $14.00 to build his project.

The final answer is: $14.00"
"To find the total cost of the phone plan, we need to determine the cost of the additional phones and add it to the cost of the main phone.

Let's assume the cost of each additional phone is x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We know that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

The total cost of the phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones:

Total cost = 20 + 40
Total cost = 60

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in a day and then multiply it by the number of days in June.

Since Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day, and 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can calculate the total number of doughnuts he makes in a day as follows:

10 dozen * 12 doughnuts/dozen = 120 doughnuts/day

Since Derrick sells all the doughnuts, we can assume he sells 120 doughnuts every day.

Now, let's calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

To find the total number of doughnuts Derrick sells in June, we multiply the number of doughnuts he sells in a day by the number of days in June:

120 doughnuts/day * 30 days = 3600 doughnuts

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Derrick makes in June by multiplying the total number of doughnuts he sells by the price of each doughnut:

3600 doughnuts * $2/doughnut = $7200

Therefore, Derrick makes $7200 in June.

The final answer is: $7200"
"To find out how many days Jade will need to upload all her photos, we need to divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she can upload per day.

First, let's find out how many photos Jade can upload per day. She can upload 6 batches of 7 photos each day, so the total number of photos she can upload per day is 6 * 7 = 42.

Now, let's divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she can upload per day: 210 / 42 = 5.

So, Jade will need 5 days to upload all her photos.

"To find out how much Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks, we need to calculate the total cost for each week and then multiply it by 5.

For one week, the cost is:
- 5 blouses at $5.00 each: 5 * $5.00 = $25.00
- 1 skirt at $6.00: $6.00
- 2 pants at $8.00 each: 2 * $8.00 = $16.00
Total cost for one week: $25.00 + $6.00 + $16.00 = $47.00

Now, we multiply the weekly cost by 5:
$47.00 * 5 = $235.00

The final answer is: $235.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find John's new speaking speed after training. 

His original speed is 150 WPM (words per minute). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so we multiply his original speed by 2.5:

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Now, we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages, each with 450 words per page:

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words/page = 4500 words

To find the time it takes to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM, we divide the total number of words by the new speed:

Time = Total words / New speed = 4500 words / 375 WPM = 12 minutes

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the total number of people he saw on the first three days and add it to the total number of people he saw on the remaining days.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the number of people on the second day is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day, so the number of people on the third day is 2 * 70 = 140.

The total number of people on the first three days is 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, the total number of people he saw on the remaining days is 60 * 4 = 240.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 260 + 240 = 500.

The final answer is: 500"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of kernels that popped during each 30-second interval and then add the additional kernels that popped from residual heat.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount popped, so 3 * 20 = 60 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, four times the initial popping rate popped, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 0.5 * 80 = 40 kernels popped.

Now, we need to calculate the number of kernels that popped from residual heat. A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds popped from residual heat, so 0.25 * 40 = 10 kernels.

To find the total number of kernels that popped, we add the kernels from each 30-second interval: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 kernels.

The final answer is: 210"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of lemonade Tim needs to make, including the extra gallon for Allen. Since Tim needs to make 4 gallons of regular lemonade and 1 extra gallon that is twice as tart, we can consider the extra gallon as 2 gallons of regular lemonade. 

So, in total, Tim needs to make 4 + 2 = 6 gallons of lemonade. 

Since each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we need to calculate the total amount of juice required for 6 gallons of lemonade. 

6 gallons * 1 cup/gallon = 6 cups of lemon juice

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we need to find out how many lemons are required to yield 6 cups of juice. 

6 cups / 1 cup/6 lemons = 6 * 6 = 36 lemons

Therefore, Tim will need 36 lemons.

"To find the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we need to calculate the daily consumption of both breeds and then multiply it by 7.

The German Shepherds consume 5 kilograms each per day, and there are 3 of them. So, their daily consumption is 5 * 3 = 15 kilograms.

The Bulldogs consume 3 kilograms each per day, and there are 2 of them. So, their daily consumption is 3 * 2 = 6 kilograms.

The total daily consumption is the sum of the consumption of both breeds: 15 + 6 = 21 kilograms.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 21 * 7 = 147 kilograms.

Therefore, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by Elvis in both directions and then find the remaining distance from his house.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the west direction. Distance = Speed * Time. Since Elvis traveled for 5 hours at 18mph, the distance traveled west is 5 * 18 = 90 miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled in the east direction. Elvis traveled for 8 hours at 18mph, so the distance traveled east is 8 * 18 = 144 miles.

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, the net distance from his house is the difference between the two distances. Net distance = 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and subtract it from the initial value.

Initial value of the boat = $9000

First year depreciation: 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Second year depreciation: 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Third year depreciation: 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after third year = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The final value of the boat after three years is $3528.

"To find the number of pink candies, we first need to determine the number of orange and yellow candies. 

We are given that there are 54 red candies. Since there are twice as many orange candies as red candies, the number of orange candies is 2 * 54 = 108.

We are also given that there are half as many yellow candies as red candies. So, the number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, we know the total number of candies is 232. We can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total.

Number of pink candies = Total number of candies - (Number of red candies + Number of orange candies + Number of yellow candies)
= 232 - (54 + 108 + 27)
= 232 - 189

"To find the total weight of the car, luggage, and children, we need to add the individual weights together. 

Total weight = weight of the car + weight of luggage + weight of children
Total weight = 1200 pounds + 250 pounds + (2 * 75 pounds)
Total weight = 1200 pounds + 250 pounds + 150 pounds
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Since the force needed to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we need to calculate 1% of 1600 pounds.

Force needed = 1% * 1600 pounds
Force needed = 0.01 * 1600 pounds
Force needed = 16 pounds

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now that we know both Mia's and Emma's ages, we can find the average of their ages by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2

"To find out how much feed is left after a week, we first need to calculate how much feed the pigs eat in a day and then multiply it by 7 to get the weekly consumption.

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so the total feed consumption per pig per day is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

Since Dexter has 5 pigs, the total feed consumption per day for all pigs is 8 * 5 = 40 pounds.

Now, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 to get the weekly consumption: 40 * 7 = 280 pounds.

"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, the total cost of the T-shirts would be 2 * $8 = $16. However, since there's a buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake only pays for one T-shirt at the original price and the other one at 50% off. So, the cost of the first T-shirt is $8 and the cost of the second T-shirt is $8 * 0.5 = $4. The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and Jake gets a 40% discount. The discount amount is $40 * 0.4 = $16. So, the cost of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store. The total cost is $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find out how much money Ryan has, we need to calculate his total earnings from doing his chores and then subtract the cost of the ice cream cones.

Ryan earns $6 each week for 3 weeks, so his total earnings are 6 * 3 = $18.

He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each, so the total cost of the ice cream cones is 4 * 1.25 = $5.

Now, let's subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from Ryan's total earnings: 18 - 5 = $13.

The cost of a movie ticket is $6.50. To find out how many tickets Ryan can buy, we need to divide his remaining money by the cost of a ticket: 13 / 6.50 = 2.

So, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets.

"To find the total amount spent by Ellen and Lani, we need to calculate the cost of the items each of them bought and then add them together.

Ellen's purchases:
- A pair of leggings for $100
- A photo frame for $5
Total cost for Ellen = $100 + $5 = $105

Lani's purchases:
- A pair of sunglasses for $30
- Two bathrobes at $100 each = 2 x $100 = $200
Total cost for Lani = $30 + $200 = $230

Total amount spent by both Ellen and Lani = Total cost for Ellen + Total cost for Lani
= $105 + $230
= $335

The final answer is: $335"
"To find the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars, we first need to calculate the cost of making one jar and then multiply it by 10.

The cost of making one jar of the mixture is the sum of the costs of its components: passion fruit, jackfruit, and honey.

Cost of passion fruit = 2 pounds * $6 per pound = $12
Cost of jackfruit = 1.5 pounds * $8 per pound = $12
Cost of honey = 2 pounds * $10 per pound = $20
Total cost of one jar = $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Now, we need to find the total revenue from selling 10 jars. 
Revenue from selling 10 jars = 10 jars * $50 per jar = $500

The profit is the difference between the revenue and the total cost of making 10 jars.
Total cost of making 10 jars = $44 * 10 = $440
Profit = Revenue - Total cost = $500 - $440 = $60

The final answer is: $60"
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add them together.

A quarter is worth $0.25, so 32 quarters are worth 32 x $0.25 = $8.

A dime is worth $0.10, so 95 dimes are worth 95 x $0.10 = $9.50.

A nickel is worth $0.05, so 120 nickels are worth 120 x $0.05 = $6.

A penny is worth $0.01, so 750 pennies are worth 750 x $0.01 = $7.50.

Now, let's add the values together: $8 + $9.50 + $6 + $7.50 = $30.50.

The total dollar amount in the jar is $30.50.

The final answer is: $30.50"
"To find out how much money Janet has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract that from the amount her parents gave her.

First, let's calculate the total amount she spent:

- Ice cream: $3.50
- Movie tickets (2 tickets): 2 x $7.50 = $15
- Bracelet: $8.50
Total spent: $3.50 + $15 + $8.50 = $27

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the amount her parents gave her:

$40 (initial amount) - $27 (total spent) = $13

Janet has $13 left."
"To find out how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days he works and then multiply it by the number of cars he services per day and his hourly wage.

Josh is open every day except Sunday and Wednesday, so he works 5 days a week. In 2 weeks, he works 5 days/week * 2 weeks = 10 days.

Since Josh services 3 cars a day, in 10 days, he services 3 cars/day * 10 days = 30 cars.

Josh gets paid $4 per car, so in 10 days, he makes 30 cars * $4/car = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Randy has 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. 

He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. So, he now has:
- 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies
- 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies

Then, he ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. So, he now has:
- 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies (unchanged)
- 4 sugar cookies (unchanged)

He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. So, he now has:
- 6 oatmeal cookies (unchanged)
- 3 chocolate chip cookies (unchanged)
- 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies

Then, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. So, he now has:
- 6 + 4 = 10 oatmeal cookies
- 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies
- 2 + 4 = 6 sugar cookies

Now, let's count the total number of cookies Randy has:
10 (oatmeal) + 7 (chocolate chip) + 6 (sugar) = 23

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the amount he would get for the first half of the collection and the second half separately, and then add them together.

Since Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, we can divide them into two equal halves: 6 toy soldiers for the first half and 6 toy soldiers for the second half.

For the first half, Matthew would get $5 per toy, so the total amount for the first half would be 6 * $5 = $30.

For the second half, Matthew would get $7 per toy, so the total amount for the second half would be 6 * $7 = $42.

To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we add the amounts for the first and second halves together: $30 + $42 = $72.

The final answer is: $72"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then determine how many holes Nate fills in per day. 

First, let's find the total number of holes dug by the dog. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes is 6 * 14 = 84.

Now, let's calculate the net number of holes filled in per day. Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled in per day is 9 - 6 = 3.

To find the total number of days it takes to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled in per day: 84 / 3 = 28.

Since we want to find the number of weeks, we need to divide the total number of days by 7 (the number of days in a week): 28 / 7 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we first need to find the average enrollment at Butler High School. 

Since Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate this by multiplying the average enrollment at Norman High School (4000) by 3/4.

Average enrollment at Butler High School = 4000 * (3/4) = 3000

Now, we need to find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools.

Difference in average enrollment = Average enrollment at Norman High School - Average enrollment at Butler High School
= 4000 - 3000
= 1000

The final answer is: 1000"
"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the total number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

First, let's add the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies:
2595 + 3075 = 5670

Now, subtract this total from the overall number of cookies made:
7995 - 5670 = 2325

So, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
- He gathered two more Petri dishes than requested, which is 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.
- The total number of items Igor had is 29, and we know that he had 8 test tubes and 16 Petri dishes.
- Let's denote the number of beakers Igor had as B. The total number of items is the sum of test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes: 8 + B + 16 = 29.

Now, let's solve for B:
8 + B + 16 = 29
B + 24 = 29
B = 29 - 24
B = 5

However, we know that Igor initially picked up 7 beakers, but lost some on the way. So, the number of beakers he lost is 7 - 5 = 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws needed for the tables and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws, so each table needs 4 x 2 = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is 8 x 4 = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, so to find out how many he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to determine the number of eggs in the second basket and then add it to the number of eggs in the first basket.

Since there are twice as many eggs in the second basket as in the first, we can calculate the number of eggs in the second basket by multiplying the number of eggs in the first basket by 2.

Number of eggs in the first basket: 10
Number of eggs in the second basket: 10 * 2 = 20

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets to find the total:

Total number of eggs = Number of eggs in the first basket + Number of eggs in the second basket
Total number of eggs = 10 + 20
Total number of eggs = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the individual amounts raised by each girl and then add them together.

Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, who raises $430. So, Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.

Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300. So, Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we add up the amounts raised by each girl: $750 (Kim) + $430 (Alexandra) + $700 (Maryam) + $300 (Sarah) = $2180.

The final answer is: $2180"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, but Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron. This means that if Aaron runs a certain distance in a certain time, Vanessa will run twice that distance in the same time, and if Vanessa runs a certain distance in a certain time, Aaron will run half that distance in the same time.

Let's denote the time it takes Vanessa to run 1 mile as 't'. Then, the time it takes Aaron to run 1 mile is 't/2' since he runs twice as fast as Vanessa.

We know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, and since he ran 4 miles, we can set up the equation:

4 / (t/2) = 16

To solve for 't', we can multiply both sides by (t/2):

4 = 16 * (t/2)
4 = 8t
t = 4/8
t = 0.5

Now that we know the time it takes Vanessa to run 1 mile, we can find the time it takes her to run 4 miles:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 / (1/t)
Time = 4 * t
Time = 4 * 0.5
Time = 2

Therefore, Vanessa took 2 minutes to complete her part of the race.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much line the caretaker needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of line required for the existing dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, we multiply 200 by 3.

200 * 3 = 600 feet of line required for the existing dock.

However, the caretaker already has 6 feet of new line. To find out how much more line he needs to buy, we subtract the amount he already has from the total amount required.

600 - 6 = 594 feet of line needed to buy.

The final answer is: 594"
"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate their daily revenue and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

First, let's calculate the daily revenue. They get 6 reservations a night, and each reservation includes 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine. 

Daily revenue = (6 reservations * 2 meals * $5) + (6 reservations * $5)
Daily revenue = (6 * 2 * $5) + (6 * $5)
Daily revenue = $60 + $30
Daily revenue = $90

Since they are open 2 days a week, we multiply the daily revenue by 2.

Weekly revenue = Daily revenue * 2
Weekly revenue = $90 * 2
Weekly revenue = $180

The final answer is: $180"
"To find the cost price of each watermelon, we first need to find the total cost of the watermelons. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price of each watermelon can be found by dividing the total cost by the number of watermelons.

Cost price of 50 watermelons = $80
Cost price of 1 watermelon = $80 / 50
Cost price of 1 watermelon = $1.60

Now, we need to find the selling price of each watermelon. The vendor sold the watermelons at a profit of 25%. To find the selling price, we need to add 25% of the cost price to the cost price.

Profit percentage = 25%
Profit = 25% of $1.60
Profit = 0.25 * $1.60
Profit = $0.40
Selling price of 1 watermelon = Cost price + Profit
Selling price of 1 watermelon = $1.60 + $0.40
Selling price of 1 watermelon = $2

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then determine the age of John's youngest son.

First, let's find James' current age. We know that James is twice as old as Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. This means that James is twice as old as 12 - 3 = 9 years old. So, James is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.

Since James is 18 years old and John had him when he was 19, John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

Now, we need to find the age of John's youngest son. We know that John's youngest son was born when John was 32. Since John is currently 37, his youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many oranges each person can peel in an hour and then compare their rates.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

To find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane, we subtract Jane's total from Ana's total: 20 - 15 = 5.

"To find the total cost Mark paid, we first need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount and then add the labor cost.

The original cost of the radiator is $400. Mark gets it for 80% off, which means he pays 20% of the original cost. To find 20% of $400, we multiply $400 by 0.20.

$400 * 0.20 = $80

So, Mark pays $80 for the radiator.

Next, we need to calculate the labor cost. The mechanic works for 3 hours at $50 an hour. To find the total labor cost, we multiply the number of hours worked by the hourly rate.

3 hours * $50/hour = $150

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost to find the total amount Mark paid.

$80 (radiator) + $150 (labor) = $230

The final answer is: $230"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation C + W = 20.

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. Therefore, we can write the equation 2C + 4W = 70.

We can solve the first equation for W: W = 20 - C.

Now, substitute W = 20 - C into the second equation: 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70.

Expand the equation: 2C + 80 - 4C = 70.

Combine like terms: -2C + 80 = 70.

Subtract 80 from both sides: -2C = -10.

Divide both sides by -2: C = 5.

The number of chickens is 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, let's find the total number of slices. There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. 

Total slices = 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

Now, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. There are 4 people in total, including Henry and his 3 friends.

Slices per person = Total slices / Number of people = 56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices/person

So, each person can have 14 slices.

The final answer is: 14"
