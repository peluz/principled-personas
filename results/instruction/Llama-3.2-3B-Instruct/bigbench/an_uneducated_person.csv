2. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the first house.
   - This means the person wearing boots must be in house 2.

From clue 2, we know the basketball player does not live in the fourth house. This means the basketball player can live in either the first, second, or third house.

From clue 3, we know the mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff. Since the swimmer lives in either the first or second house, the mystery book reader must live in the first house if the swimmer is in the first house, or in the second house if the swimmer is in the second house.

Now, let's try to fit the remaining people:

- If the swimmer is in the first house, the mystery book reader is in the first house, and the golfer is in the first house. This means the basketball player must be in the second house, and the romance book lover must be in the third house. This arrangement satisfies all the clues.

- If the swimmer is in the second house, the mystery book reader is in the second house, and the golfer is in the first house. This means the basketball player must be in the first house, and the romance book lover must be in the third house. This arrangement also satisfies all the clues.

"To solve this problem, we can analyze the given clues step by step.

From clue 3, we know the baseball player lives in the second house.

From clue 6, we know the tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover. Since the basketball player lives to the left of the swimmer (clue 2), and the basketball player does not live in the first house (clue 1), the possible positions for the basketball player are the second, third, or fourth house.

From clue 4, we know the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the dog owner. Since the baseball player lives in the second house, the dog owner must live in the first house.

From clue 5, we know the bird keeper does not live in the first house. Since the dog owner lives in the first house, the bird keeper must live in either the second, third, or fourth house.

From clue 7, we know the bird keeper does not live in the third house. So, the bird keeper must live in either the second or the fourth house.

Now, let's combine the information:

- The bird keeper lives in either the second or the fourth house.
- The fish enthusiast lives to the right of the dog owner, so the fish enthusiast lives in the third house.

- The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV. This means the person who owns a sedan cannot be in house 3, so they must be in house 1 or 2.

- The person who owns a gameboy lives in house 2, because if they lived in house 1, the person who owns a sedan would have to live in house 3, which is not possible since the swimmer lives to the right of the person who owns an SUV.

- The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV. This means the person who owns a sedan lives in house 1.

- The person who owns a gameboy lives in house 2.

"To solve this problem, we can analyze the given clues step by step.

From clue 11, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.

From clue 1, the person who has a phone lives directly next to the person who had pizza. Since the person who had pizza does not live in the third house (clue 4), the person who has a phone must live in either the first or the second house.

From clue 5, the person who has a computer lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house, the person who has a computer must live in the second house.

From clue 3, the person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the fish enthusiast. Since the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house, the fish enthusiast must live in the second house.

From clue 6, the person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy. Since the person who has a computer lives in the second house, the person who owns horses must live in the first house. However, this contradicts the information that the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house. Therefore, the person who owns horses must live in the third house.

From clue 2, the cat lover lives in the third house. Since the person who owns horses lives in the third house, the cat lover must also live in the third house.

From clue 8, the bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who owns horses lives in the third house, the bird keeper must live in either the first or the second house. However, the person who has a computer lives in the second house, so the bird keeper must live in the first house.

From clue 7, there is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who has a television lives. Since the bird keeper lives in the first house, the person who has a television must live in the fourth house.

From clue 9, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who owns horses lives in the third house, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the second or fourth house. However, the person who has a computer lives in the second house, so the person who ate spaghetti must live in the fourth house.

From clue 10, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth house, the person who had stew must live in the third house. However, this contradicts the information that the cat lover lives in the third house. Therefore, the person who had stew must live in the fifth house.

From clue 4, the person who had pizza does not live in the third house. Since the person who had stew lives in the fifth house, the person who had pizza must live in either the first, second, or fourth house. However, the person who has a computer lives in the second house, and the person who has a phone lives directly next to the person who had pizza. Therefore, the person who had pizza must live in the first house.

Now we have the following arrangement:

- House 1: person who had pizza, person who has a phone, person who owns horses, bird keeper, person who had stew
- House 2: person who has a computer, person who has a gameboy, person who ate grilled cheese, person who has a television

"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.
2. The person who owns a sedan does not live in the third house.
3. The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
4. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
5. The person who is wearing running shoes and the person who is wearing boots live directly next to each other.
6. The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.

From clue 1, we know the person wearing running shoes lives in the first house.

From clue 5, since the person wearing running shoes and the person wearing boots live directly next to each other, and the person wearing running shoes lives in the first house, the person wearing boots must live in the second house.

From clue 4, the person wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible. Since the person wearing boots lives in the second house, the person wearing sandals must live in the first house, but this contradicts clue 1. Therefore, the person wearing sandals must live in the third house.

From clue 3, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person wearing sandals lives in the third house, the person wearing high heels must live in the fourth house.

From clue 6, the person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house, which is already occupied by the person wearing high heels. This is a contradiction. However, we can re-evaluate clue 3. The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person wearing high heels lives in the fourth house, the person who drives a minivan must live in the third house. But we already know the person wearing sandals lives in the third house. Therefore, the person wearing sandals must be the person who drives a minivan.

From clue 2, the person who owns a sedan does not live in the third house. Since the person wearing sandals (who drives a minivan) lives in the third house, the person who owns a sedan must live in the first house. However, we already know the person wearing running shoes lives in the first house. Therefore, the person wearing running shoes must be the person who owns a sedan.

From clue 1, the person wearing running shoes lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
2. The cricketer lives in the first house.
3. The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan.
4. The person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.

From clue 2, we know the cricketer lives in house 1. 

From clue 4, the person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. Since the cricketer lives in house 1, the person who owns horses must live in house 1. But that's not possible because the cricketer lives in house 1. So, we need to re-evaluate clue 4. 

Let's re-evaluate clue 4. The person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. This means the person who owns horses lives in house 1, and the person who owns a sedan lives in house 2. 

Now, from clue 3, the cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan. This means the cat lover lives in house 3.

From clue 1, the person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. Since the cat lover lives in house 3, the person who drives a truck must live in house 3. 

Now, we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: Person who owns a sedan
- House 3: Cat lover and person who drives a truck

The only person left is the basketball player, and the only house left is house 2. 

So, the basketball player lives in house 2."

From clue 2, the person wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the person driving a convertible lives in the first house, the person wearing loafers must live in the second house, which is occupied by the person wearing running shoes. This means the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the third house.

From clue 4, the person who likes milk lives in the third house, which is already occupied by the person who ate grilled cheese. This means the person who likes milk must live in the fourth house.

From clue 3, the person wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house. Since the person wearing running shoes lives in the second house, the person wearing high heels must live in the first house.

Since the person wearing high heels lives in the first house, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the second, third, or fourth house.

Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the third house.

Since the person who owns a sedan cannot live in the first house (because the person wearing high heels lives in the first house), the person who owns a sedan must live in the third or fourth house. However, the person who likes milk lives in the fourth house, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house. Therefore, the person who owns a sedan must live in the third house.

However, we know the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house, and the person who owns a sedan lives in the third house. This is a contradiction. We need to re-evaluate the information.

From clue 6, the person who owns a sedan lives two houses away from the person who only drinks water. Since the person who owns a sedan cannot live in the first house, the person who owns a sedan must live in the third or fourth house.

The correct order of the houses is:

1. High heels
2. Running shoes

3. The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
4. There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
5. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the person eating apples lives to the left of the minivan. Since the minivan is the third house, the person eating apples must live in either the first or second house.

From clue 5, we know the person eating oranges does not live in the second house. This means the person eating oranges must live in the first house, but we already know the tea drinker lives in the first house. So, the person eating oranges must be the tea drinker, which contradicts clue 1. This means we need to re-evaluate the information.

Let's re-evaluate clue 2. Since the person eating oranges does not live in the second house, and the tea drinker lives in the first house, the person eating oranges must live in the third house. This means the person eating apples lives in the second house.

2. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast can live in either the second or the third house.

3. The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person who likes white can live in either the first or the second house.

4. The person who likes red lives in the second house.

Now, let's combine the information:
- The person who likes white can live in the first house (from clue 3).

"Let's analyze the clues:

1. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples.
   - This means the person eating apples lives in house 1, and the person with the radio lives in house 2.

2. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
   - Since the person with the radio lives in house 2, the violinist must live in house 1.

3. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house.
   - This means the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house 1.

4. The basketball player does not live in the first house.
   - Since the violinist lives in house 1, the basketball player must live in house 2.

Now, let's summarize the information:
- House 1: 
  - Violinist
  - Bouquet of lilies
  - Eating apples
  - Lives to the left of the person with the radio

- House 2: 
  - Basketball player
  - Bouquet of roses
  - Eating oranges

"To solve this problem, we can use the given clues to deduce the order of the people and their houses.

From clue 1, we know the tennis player lives in the third house.

From clue 2, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.

From clue 3, we know the golfer lives in the fourth house.

From clue 4, we know there is one house between the person who ate fried rice and the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in the sixth house.

From clue 5, we know the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. Since the tennis player lives in the third house, the cricketer must live in the first house.

From clue 6, we know the person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the sixth house, the person who had stew lives in the fifth house. However, this contradicts clue 2, which states the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house. This means our initial assumption about the person who ate fried rice in the second house is incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the information. Since the person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in the sixth house, the person who had stew must live in the fifth house. This means the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the second house.

Now, we know the order of the houses is:
- The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.
- The person who had stew lives in the fifth house.
- The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the sixth house.
- The tennis player lives in the third house.
- The golfer lives in the fourth house.

Since the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer, and the cricketer lives in the first house, the person who had pizza must live in the first house.

The correct order of the houses is:
- The person who had pizza lives in the first house.
- The cricketer lives in the first house.
- The tennis player lives in the third house.
- The golfer lives in the fourth house.
- The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.
- The person who had stew lives in the fifth house.
- The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the sixth house.
- The person who ate spaghetti lives in the sixth house.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
2. The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
3. The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
4. The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.

From clue 4, we know the person who ate spaghetti lives next to the person who only drinks water. Since the person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti (clue 2), the person who likes white must live in house 1. 

The person who ate spaghetti lives next to the person who only drinks water, and the person who likes white lives in house 1. So, the person who only drinks water must live in house 2.

From clue 3, the baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes white lives in house 1, the baseball player must live in house 2.

Now, we know the person who likes white lives in house 1, the person who only drinks water lives in house 2, and the baseball player lives in house 2. 

The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house (clue 1). Since the person who likes white lives in house 1, the person who is wearing running shoes must live in house 2.

The person who is wearing loafers must live in house 1, since the person who likes white lives in house 1.

So, the person who is wearing loafers lives in house 1. The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The coffee drinker lives to the left of the person eating mangos.
2. The person who only drinks water lives to the right of the root beer lover.
3. The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
4. The person eating oranges does not live in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the root beer lover can't live in house 2. From clue 4, we know the person eating oranges can't live in house 2 either. This means the root beer lover and the person eating oranges must live in either house 1 or 3.

From clue 1, we know the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person eating mangos. Since the person eating mangos can't live in house 1 (because the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person eating mangos), the person eating mangos must live in house 3.

Now, we have the following possibilities:
- House 1: coffee drinker, oranges
- House 2: root beer lover
- House 3: person eating mangos

From clue 2, we know the person who only drinks water lives to the right of the root beer lover. Since the root beer lover lives in house 2, the person who only drinks water must live in house 3.

However, we already know the person eating mangos lives in house 3. This means the person who only drinks water can't live in house 3. This is a contradiction. Therefore, our initial assumption about the person eating oranges living in house 1 must be incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the possibilities:
- House 1: coffee drinker, root beer lover
- House 2: person eating oranges
- House 3: person eating mangos

From clue 1, we know the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person eating mangos. This is true.

From clue 2, we know the person who only drinks water lives to the right of the root beer lover. This is also true.

The root beer lover lives in house 1, and the person eating oranges lives in house 2. The person eating mangos lives in house 3.

From clue 2, we know the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the second house. 

Now, we know the person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house (clue 1). This means the person who ate fried rice must live in the third house. 

So, the order is: 
- The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
- The person who is wearing boots lives in the second house.
- The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house. The answer is (A) 2."

"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given clues and deduce the correct order of the houses.

From clue 1, the dog owner lives in the third house.

From clue 9, we know the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who had pizza. Since the person who is eating mangos lives in the first house, the person who had pizza lives in the second house.

From clue 11, we"
"Let's analyze the clues:

1. The person who is eating grapes does not live in the first house.
2. The baseball player lives in the second house.
3. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the person who drives a convertible lives in the second house. Since the baseball player lives in the second house, the person who drives a convertible must be the baseball player.

From clue 2, we know the baseball player lives in the second house. Since the person who drives a convertible lives in the second house, the baseball player must be the one driving the convertible.

From clue 1, we know the person who is eating grapes does not live in the first house. Since the baseball player lives in the second house, the person who is eating grapes must live in the first house.

Now, we know:
- The person who eats grapes lives in house 1.
- The person who drives a convertible lives in house 2.
- The baseball player lives in house 2.

Since the person who drives a convertible lives in the second house, and the baseball player lives in the second house, the person who drives a convertible must be the baseball player.

The only person left is the one eating mangos. Since the person who eats grapes lives in the first house, the person eating mangos must live in the second house.

Therefore, the person who is eating mangos lives in house 2."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
2. The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
3. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating kiwis.
4. The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes blue lives in the second house. 

From clue 3, we know the person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who is eating kiwis. This means the person who likes blue can't be in house 1 (because the person who likes blue is in house 2), and the person who is eating kiwis can't be in house 3 (because the person who likes blue is to the left of the person who is eating kiwis). 

From clue 4, we know the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges. This means the person who is eating apples can't be in house 3 (because the person who is eating oranges can't be in house 1). 

Now, let's try to fit the people in the houses:

- House 1: Can't be the person who likes blue (clue 2), can't be the person who is eating kiwis (clue 3), and can't be the person who is eating oranges (clue 4). So, the person who is eating apples lives in house 1.
- House 2: The person who likes blue lives here (clue 2).
- House 3: The person who is eating oranges lives here (clue 4).

Now, let's look at clue 1: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green. We know the person who likes blue lives in house 2, and the person who is eating oranges lives in house 3. This means the person who likes white must live in house 3. But we already know the person who is eating oranges lives in house 3. This is a contradiction. 

Wait, we made a mistake. We can't have the person who likes white in house 3 because the person who is eating oranges lives in house 3. 

Let's re-examine the clues. We know the person who likes blue lives in house 2, and the person who is eating oranges lives in house 3. The person who likes white must live in house 1. 

So, the correct answer is (B) 1."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The root beer lover lives to the right of the person with a rose bouquet.
2. The soccer player lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
3. The person with a gameboy lives to the left of the mystery book reader.

From clue 3, we know the gameboy owner lives to the left of the mystery book reader. From clue 2, the soccer player lives to the left of the mystery book reader. So, the order is: gameboy owner -> soccer player -> mystery book reader.

Now, from clue 1, the root beer lover lives to the right of the person with a rose bouquet. Since the mystery book reader is to the right of the soccer player, the root beer lover must be to the right of the mystery book reader. 

So, the order is: gameboy owner -> soccer player -> mystery book reader -> root beer lover.

Now, we need to find the person with a rose bouquet. Since the root beer lover lives to the right of the person with a rose bouquet, the person with a rose bouquet must live in house 1."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues:

1. The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
2. There are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the dog owner lives.
3. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
5. The cat lover does not live in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the truck owner lives left of the sedan owner. From clue 4, the fish enthusiast lives left of the dog owner. So, the order is: truck, sedan, fish enthusiast, dog owner.

From clue 2, there are two houses between the truck owner and the dog owner. This means the dog owner lives 3 houses from the truck owner. 

Now, let's look at the options:
- If the truck owner lives in house 1, the dog owner lives in house 4, which is not possible because the fish enthusiast lives left of the dog owner.
- If the truck owner lives in house 2, the dog owner lives in house 5, which is not possible because the fish enthusiast lives left of the dog owner.
- If the truck owner lives in house 3, the dog owner lives in house 6, which is not possible because the fish enthusiast lives left of the dog owner.
- If the truck owner lives in house 4, the dog owner lives in house 7, which is not possible because the fish enthusiast lives left of the dog owner.

However, if the truck owner lives in house 1, the fish enthusiast lives in house 2, the sedan owner lives in house 3, and the dog owner lives in house 4, this order satisfies all the given conditions.

Therefore, the dog owner lives in house 4."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
2. The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
3. The root beer lover lives in the second house.
4. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who only drinks water.
5. The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.

From clue 5, we know the person who likes yellow lives in the third house. 

From clue 2, we know the person who likes yellow lives to the left of the person who likes milk. Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who likes milk must be in the fourth house.

From clue 3, we know the root beer lover lives in the second house.

From clue 4, we know the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who only drinks water. Since the person who likes milk is in the fourth house, the person who only drinks water must be in the first house.

Now, let's put it all together:

- The person who likes yellow is in the third house.
- The person who likes milk is in the fourth house.
- The root beer lover is in the second house.
- The person who only drinks water is in the first house.
- The person who likes white must be in the remaining house, which is the first house.

So, the person who likes blue lives in the fourth house."

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The cellist lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
   This means the cellist lives in house 1 and the person with the gameboy lives in house 2.

2. The dog owner does not live in the first house.
   Since the cellist lives in house 1, the dog owner must live in house 2.

So, the dog owner lives in house 2."
"Let's analyze the clues:

1. The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
2. The person who drives a minivan lives in the first house.
3. The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
4. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
5. The person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house.
6. The person who has a computer does not live in the first house.

From clue 2, we know the person who drives a minivan lives in the first house. 

From clue 1, we know the person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy. This means the person who has a radio lives in the 4th house.

From clue 5, we know the person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house. This means the person who drives a convertible lives in either the 1st, 2nd, or 4th house.

From clue 6, we know the person who has a computer does not live in the first house. This means the person who has a computer lives in either the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th house.

From clue 3, we know the person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV. This means the person who has a phone lives in either the 1st or 2nd house.

Now, let's combine all the information:

- The person who drives a minivan lives in the 1st house.
- The person who has a gameboy lives in the 3rd house.
- The person who has a radio lives in the 4th house.
- The person who drives a convertible lives in either the 1st, 2nd, or 4th house.
- The person who has a computer lives in either the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th house.
- The person who has a phone lives in either the 1st or 2nd house.

Since the person who drives a convertible does not live in the 3rd house, and the person who has a computer does not live in the 1st house, the only possible position for the person who drives a convertible is the 2nd house.

Now, we know the person who drives a convertible lives in the 2nd house, and the person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV. This means the person who owns an SUV lives in the 3rd house.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 3."

"Let's think about this. 

We know that the person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. 

Since there are only two houses, the person who ate fried rice must live in house 2. 

Now, we need to find out who is the science fiction book fanatic.

So, the science fiction book fanatic must live in house 1. 

The answer is (B) 1."

1. The pianist lives in the first house. (House 1)
2. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses. (This means the root beer lover can't live in house 1, so they live in house 2)
3. The person who likes white does not live in the second house. (This means the person who likes white lives in house 1)

Now we have:
- House 1: Pianist (likes white)
- House 2: Root beer lover (can't be the dog owner, since the dog owner lives in house 1)

The only one left is the dog owner and the horse owner. Since the root beer lover lives in house 2, the dog owner must live in house 1."

Now, we have the following arrangement:

- House 3: Fried rice
- House 4: History book buff

From clue 4, we know the violinist does not live in the fourth house. Since the history book buff lives in the fourth house, the violinist must live in the second house.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who only drinks water lives in the first house.
2. There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the person who likes milk lives.
   - This means the person who likes milk lives in the third house.

3. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house, the person who has a vase of tulips must live in the first house.

4. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.
   - This confirms the previous statement.

Now, let's summarize the information:
- The person who only drinks water lives in the first house.
- The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the first house.
- The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.
- The person who likes milk lives in the third house.

"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given clues step by step.

From clue 9, we know the person wearing loafers lives in the first house.

From clue 11, the swimmer lives to the left of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the third house (clue 5), the person who likes green must live in either the first or the second house.

From clue 1, the person wearing boots does not live in the second house. This means the person wearing boots must live in either the first or the fourth house.

From clue 3, the person who likes yellow and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the third house, the person who has a gameboy must live in either the second or the fourth house.

From clue 7, the person who has a gameboy lives to the right of the person who has a phone. This means the person who has a gameboy cannot live in the second house, so the person who has a gameboy must live in the fourth house.

From clue 10, the person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio. Since the person who has a gameboy lives in the fourth house, the person who has a phone must live in the third house.

From clue 8, the tennis player lives in the third house. This confirms our previous conclusion.

From clue 2, the person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the third house, the person who likes blue must live in either the fourth or the fifth house. However, the person who has a gameboy lives in the fourth house, so the person who likes blue must live in the fifth house.

From clue 4, the cricketer lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the third house, the person who is wearing sandals must live in the fourth house. However, we already know the person who has a gameboy lives in the fourth house, so the person who is wearing sandals must be the person who has a gameboy.

From clue 6, the person who has a phone does not live in the second house. Since the person who has a phone lives in the third house, this clue does not provide any new information.

From clue 1, the person wearing boots does not live in the second house. Since the person who has a gameboy lives in the fourth house, the person wearing boots must live in the first house.

Now we have the following information:
- The person wearing loafers lives in the first house.
- The person wearing boots lives in the first house.
- The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
- The person who has a phone lives in the third house.
- The person who has a gameboy lives in the fourth house.
- The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.
- The person who is wearing sandals lives in the fourth house.

The only remaining house is the second house, which must be occupied by the cricketer.

From Clue 2, we know the order of the first three houses is: 
- Romance book lover
- History book buff
- Green

From Clue 4, we know the first house is yellow.

From Clue 3, we know the person who had pizza does not live in the first house, so the person who had pizza must live in the second or third house.

From Clue 5, we know the person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the romance book lover. Since the romance book lover lives in the first house, the person who ate fried rice must live in the third house.

Now we have the order: 
- Yellow (1)
- Romance book lover
- History book buff
- Fried rice (3)

So, the person who likes yellow lives in the first house, which is house number 1."

From clue 3, we know the person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who is wearing boots lives in the second house, the person who is wearing running shoes must live in the first house. However, we already know the person who drives a convertible lives in the first house, so the person who is wearing running shoes must be the person who drives a convertible.

Now we have the following order:

1. Fantasy book enthusiast (drives a convertible, wears running shoes, eats pizza)
2. History book buff (owns an SUV, wears boots, eats grilled cheese)
3. Mystery book reader (drives a truck, wears sandals, eats fried rice)
4. Science fiction book fanatic (wears high heels)

The person who had pizza lives in the first house, so the answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this problem, we can use the given clues to deduce the correct order of the houses.

From clue 5, we know the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.

From clue 7, we know the saxophonist lives in the fourth house.

From clue 3, we know there is one house between the percussionist and the mystery book reader. Since the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house, the percussionist must live in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover. So, the romance book lover must live in the second house.

From clue 2, we know there is one house between the history book buff and the guitarist. Since the percussionist lives in the third house and the romance book lover lives in the second house, the history book buff must live in the first house, and the guitarist must live in the fifth house.

From clue 6, we know the saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other. Since the saxophonist lives in the fourth house, the violinist must live in the fifth house.

So, the correct order of the houses is:
1. History book buff
2. Romance book lover
3. Percussionist
4. Saxophonist
5. Violinist

Therefore, the number of the house where the violinist lives is 5."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who has a television lives in the fourth house.
2. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.
3. The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.
4. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing loafers.
5. There are two houses between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.

From clue 2, we know the person wearing loafers lives in the second house. From clue 4, the person wearing boots lives to the left of the person wearing loafers, so the person wearing boots lives in the first house.

From clue 1, the person with the television lives in the fourth house. From clue 3, the person with the phone does not live in the second house, so the person with the phone must live in the first, third, or fourth house. Since the person with the television lives in the fourth house, the person with the phone must live in the first or third house.

From clue 5, there are two houses between the person with the radio and the person with the sandals. This means the person with the radio lives in the first house, and the person with the sandals lives in the third house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: person with the radio, boots
- House 2: person with the phone, loafers
- House 3: person with the television, sandals
- House 4: person with the gameboy

So, the person who has the gameboy lives in house 4."
"Let's analyze the clues:

1. The person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house.
2. The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
3. The person who likes milk does not live in the first house.
4. The coffee drinker does not live in the first house.
5. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.

From clue 1, we know the person wearing high heels lives in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the coffee drinker does not live in the second house, so the coffee drinker must live in either the first or the third house.

From clue 3, we know the person who likes milk does not live in the first house, so the person who likes milk must live in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the coffee drinker does not live in the first house, so the coffee drinker must live in the third house.

From clue 5, we know the person wearing running shoes lives in the third house, which means the person wearing running shoes is the coffee drinker.

Now we have the following information:
- The person wearing high heels lives in the second house.
- The person wearing running shoes lives in the third house.
- The person wearing running shoes is the coffee drinker.

Since the person wearing high heels lives in the second house, and the person wearing running shoes lives in the third house, the person wearing loafers must live in the first house.

The person who likes milk does not live in the first house, so the person who likes milk must live in the second house. But we already know the person wearing high heels lives in the second house, so the person who likes milk must be the person wearing high heels.

Therefore, the person wearing high heels lives in the second house. The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's think about this. 

From clue 1, we know the person wearing loafers doesn't live in the first house. 

From clue 2, we know the mystery book reader doesn't live in the second house. 

Since there are only two houses, and the person wearing loafers can't live in the first house, that means the person wearing loafers must live in the second house. 

The person wearing high heels must live in the first house. 

Since the history book buff can't live in the second house, and the mystery book reader can't live in the first house, the history book buff must live in the first house. 

So, the person wearing loafers lives in the second house. 

The answer is (B) 2."

- The person who is wearing boots lives in house 1 (since the person who is wearing boots lives to the left of the person who had pizza, and the person who is wearing boots cannot be in house 3 because the person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the third house). 
- The person who is wearing running shoes and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other. 
- The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who had stew. 
- The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the person who had pizza.

1. The person who has a rose bouquet lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
2. The saxophonist does not live in the first house.
3. The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.

From clue 3, we know the person eating mangos lives in house 1. 

From clue 1, we know the person with the rose bouquet lives to the left of the person with the lilies. Since the person eating mangos lives in house 1, the person with the rose bouquet must live in house 1. 

Now, we have:
- House 1: person eating mangos, person with rose bouquet, pianist
- House 2: person eating apples, person with lilies, saxophonist

From clue 2, we know the saxophonist does not live in the first house. So, the saxophonist must live in house 2.

Therefore, the person eating apples lives in house 2."

3. The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.

- The person with a rose bouquet lives in the first house.
- The person with a sedan lives in the second house.
- The person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the third house.

"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given clues and deduce the correct order of the people in the houses.

From clue 4, we know the person who likes yellow lives in the first house. Clue 13 tells us the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house. Since the person who likes yellow and the person who is eating kiwis live in the same house, the person who likes yellow must be eating kiwis.

From clue 5, the person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes yellow is eating kiwis, the person who is eating a banana must be in the second house.

From clue 10, the person who owns an SUV and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the person who is eating a banana is in the second house, the person who owns an SUV must be in the third house.

From clue 2, the cricketer lives to the left of the person who drives a convertible. Clue 9 tells us the person who drives a convertible lives in the fourth house. Since the person who drives a convertible lives in the fourth house, the cricketer must live in the third house.

From clue 6, the swimmer lives to the left of the person who likes white. Since the person who is eating a banana is in the second house, the swimmer must be in the first house.

From clue 11, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the person who is eating a banana is in the second house, the person who drives a minivan must be in the first house. However, we already know the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house. Therefore, the person who drives a minivan must be in the second house, and the person who is eating a banana must be in the third house.

From clue 12, the person who owns an SUV and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other. Since the person who owns an SUV is in the third house, the person who likes blue must be in the fourth house.

From clue 7, the person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges. Since the person who is eating oranges lives in the fourth house, the person who is eating mangos must be in the third house. However, we already know the person who is eating a banana is in the third house. Therefore, the person who is eating mangos must be in the second house, and the person who is eating oranges must be in the fourth house.

Now we have the following order: 
- The person who likes yellow (kiwis) lives in the first house.
- The person who drives a minivan lives in the second house.

However, we already know the person who likes yellow (kiwis) lives in the first house, the person who drives a minivan lives in the second house, and the person who is eating a banana lives in the third house. Therefore, the soccer player must live in the second house.

From clue 14, there is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the cricketer lives. Since the swimmer lives in the first house, the cricketer must live in the third house.

Now we have the following order: 
- The person who likes yellow (kiwis) lives in the first house.

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The history book buff lives in the first house.
2. The golfer lives in the second house.
3. There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the science fiction book fanatic lives.

From clue 3, we know that the swimmer and the science fiction book fanatic are separated by one house. Since the history book buff lives in the first house, the swimmer and the science fiction book fanatic must be in the second and third houses, respectively.

From clue 2, we know the golfer lives in the second house. This means the history book buff (in the first house) and the golfer (in the second house) are separated by one house. This is already accounted for, so the only possible arrangement is:

House 1: History book buff
House 2: Golfer
House 3: Science fiction book fanatic

Since the swimmer and the science fiction book fanatic are separated by one house, the swimmer must live in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who owns horses.
   - This means the person who owns horses lives in house 2, because if they lived in house 1, the person wearing sandals would be in house 1, which is not possible.

2. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - Since the person who owns horses lives in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 1.

Now, let's look at the remaining clues:
- The person who ate fried rice is not the history book buff (since the history book buff lives to the right of the spaghetti eater), and they are not the cat lover (since the cat lover must live in house 1, and the spaghetti eater lives in house 1).
- The person who ate fried rice must be the romance book lover, because the history book buff lives to the right of the spaghetti eater, and the cat lover lives in house 1.

So, the person who ate fried rice lives in house 1."
"Let's think about this. 

From clue 1, we know the person who owns a sedan lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. 

From clue 2, we know the flutist doesn't live in the first house. 

Since the person who owns a sedan lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies, and the flutist doesn't live in the first house, the flutist must live in the second house. 

Now, we know the person who owns a sedan lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. So, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the first house. 

Therefore, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house 1."
"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given clues step by step.

From clue 3, we know the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the fourth house.

From clue 4, the fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer. Since the swimmer lives in the second house, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.

From clue 5, the golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the third house, the golfer lives in the fourth house.

From clue 6, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in the third house.

From clue 7, the tennis player does not live in the fourth house. Since the golfer lives in the fourth house, the tennis player lives in the first or second house.

From clue 8, there is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives. Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the third house and the person who has a rose bouquet lives in the third house, this clue is not possible.

"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given clues.

From clue 7, we know the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti cannot be in the first house (because the person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti), the person who likes blue must live in the second, third, or fourth house.

From clue 3, we know the person who had stew does not live in the fourth house. This means the person who had stew must live in the first, second, or third house.

From clue 6, we know the person who likes red lives directly to the left of the person who had stew. Since the person who had stew cannot live in the fourth house, the person who likes red must live in the first or second house.

From clue 8, we know there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes yellow lives. This means the person who likes white cannot live in the first, second, or fourth house.

Now, let's combine all the information:

- The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
- The person who likes red lives in the first house (because the person who had stew cannot live in the fourth house, and the person who likes red lives directly to the left of the person who had stew).
- The person who had stew lives in the second house (because the person who likes red lives in the first house, and the person who likes red lives directly to the left of the person who had stew).
- The person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, and the person who ate spaghetti cannot be in the first house. So, the person who likes blue lives in the third house.
- The person who likes white lives in the fourth house (because the person who likes white cannot live in the first, second, or fourth house).

Therefore, the person who likes white lives in the fourth house."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The violinist lives to the right of the basketball player.
2. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
3. The basketball player lives to the right of the tennis player.
4. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.
5. The percussionist lives in the second house.

From clue 5, we know the percussionist lives in the second house. 

From clue 2, we know the person who likes red lives in the third house. 

From clue 3, we know the basketball player lives to the right of the tennis player. 

From clue 1, we know the violinist lives to the right of the basketball player. 

Now, let's try to fit the information together:

- The percussionist lives in the second house.
- The person who likes red lives in the third house.
- The basketball player lives to the right of the tennis player.
- The violinist lives to the right of the basketball player.

Since the percussionist lives in the second house, and the person who likes red lives in the third house, the violinist must live in the first house. 

Now, let's fit the basketball player and the tennis player. The basketball player lives to the right of the tennis player, and the violinist lives to the right of the basketball player. So, the basketball player must live in the third house, and the tennis player must live in the second house.

However, we know the percussionist lives in the second house, and the person who likes yellow does not live in the second house. This means the tennis player must be the person who likes yellow, and the basketball player must be the person who likes red.

So, the correct order is:
- The violinist lives in the first house.
- The tennis player (who likes yellow) lives in the second house.
- The basketball player (who likes red) lives in the third house.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in the third house. The answer is (B) 3."

From clue 7, the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza. Since the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice (clue 10), the person who likes blue must live in the first house.

From clue 8, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who likes blue lives in the first house, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live in the second house.

From clue 9, the flutist does not live in the first house. Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house, the flutist must live in the third or fourth house.

From clue 10, the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who likes blue lives in the first house, the person who had pizza must live in the second house.

From clue 11, the percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house, the percussionist must live in the first house.

From clue 12, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the fourth house.

From clue 13, the guitarist lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house, the person who has a vase of tulips must live in the third house.

From clue 14, there is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the person who ate spaghetti. Since the history book buff lives in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the fourth house.

Now we have the following arrangement:

- House 1: Percussionist (likes blue), has a bouquet of daffodils, had pizza
- House 2: History book buff (likes white), has a carnations arrangement, lives directly left of the romance book lover
- House 3: Flutist (likes yellow), has a vase of tulips, lives directly left of the guitarist
- House 4: Romance book lover (likes green), has a rose bouquet, eats spaghetti, lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast

The only person left is the guitarist, who lives in the third house."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The pianist and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.
   - This means the pianist and the person eating kiwis can be in either house 1 and 2 or house 2 and 3.

2. The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
   - This means the flutist can be in house 3 if the violinist is in house 1 or 2.

3. There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
   - This means the person eating grapes can be in house 1, 2, or 3.

4. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
   - This means the violinist can be in house 1 or 2, and the person eating kiwis can be in house 2 or 3.

Combining the information from the first two clues, we know the pianist and the person eating kiwis are in house 1 and 2 or house 2 and 3. 

From clue 3, the person eating grapes can't be in house 1 because there's no house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis. 

From clue 4, the violinist can't be in house 3 because there's no house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis. 

So, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: violinist, house 2: pianist, house 3: person eating kiwis
- House 1: person eating grapes, house 2: person eating kiwis, house 3: violinist
- House 1: person eating grapes, house 2: pianist, house 3: person eating kiwis

In both cases, the pianist lives in house 2."
"Let's think about this. 

We know the fantasy book enthusiast doesn't live in the first house (house 1), so they must live in the second house (house 2). 

We also know the person eating kiwis lives in the first house. 

So, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 2."
"To solve this problem, we can analyze the given clues step by step.

From clue 5, we know the person who likes yellow lives in the first house.

From clue 9, we know the person who has a radio lives in the third house.

From clue 10, we know the person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the first house, the person who has a television lives in the second house.

From clue 1, we know the bird keeper and the person who has a television live directly next to each other. Since the person who has a television lives in the second house, the bird keeper lives in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper. Since the bird keeper lives in the third house, the cat lover lives in the fourth house.

From clue 3, we know the person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner. Since the cat lover lives in the fourth house, the dog owner lives in the second house.

From clue 6, we know the person who had pizza does not live in the third house. Since the person who likes red lives in the third house, the person who had pizza lives in the first house.

From clue 7, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house.

From clue 12, we know there is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who has a television lives. Since the person who has a television lives in the second house, the person who ate fried rice lives in the first house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: Person who likes yellow, has a gameboy, had pizza
- House 2: Person who has a computer, has a television, has a radio, dog owner
- House 3: Person who likes red, has a radio, bird keeper
- House 4: Person who has a computer, has a television, has a radio, cat lover, has a gameboy, had grilled cheese

However, we have a problem. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house, but the person who has a computer lives in the second house. This is a contradiction.

Let's re-examine the clues. From clue 11, we know the person who has a computer does not live in the second house. This means the person who has a computer lives in the first house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: Person who likes yellow, has a computer, has a gameboy, had pizza
- House 2: Person who has a television, dog owner
- House 3: Person who likes red, has a radio, bird keeper
- House 4: Person who has a computer, has a television, has a radio, cat lover, has a gameboy, had grilled cheese

The person who likes red lives in the third house."
"Let's analyze the clues:

1. The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
2. The pianist lives directly left of the cellist.

So, the correct answer is (A) 1."

From clue 4, we know there is one house between the person wearing running shoes and the person with a bouquet of lilies.

From clue 6, we know the person with a vase of tulips does not live in the fourth house.

Combining clues 2, 5, 6, and 8, we can deduce that the person with a vase of tulips lives in the third or the fourth house. However, since the person with a vase of tulips does not live in the fourth house (clue 6), the person with a vase of tulips lives in the third house.

From clue 8, the person with a bouquet of daffodils and the person wearing running shoes live directly next to each other. Since the person with a vase of tulips lives in the third house, the person with a bouquet of daffodils and the person wearing running shoes must live in the second and fourth houses, in that order.

From clue 1, the person wearing boots and the person with a carnations arrangement live directly next to each other. Since the person with a bouquet of daffodils and the person wearing running shoes live in the second and fourth houses, the person wearing boots and the person with a carnations arrangement must live in the first and fifth houses, in that order.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: person wearing boots and carnations arrangement
- House 2: person with a bouquet of daffodils and running shoes
- House 3: person with a vase of tulips
- House 4: empty
- House 5: person with a bouquet of lilies and sandals

The person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the fifth house."

2. The person who likes green lives in the second house.
3. The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house.
4. The person who likes green lives in the second house.
5. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
6. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
7. The person who had stew does not live in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes green lives in the second house. From clue 4, we know the person who likes green lives in the second house. This confirms clue 2.

From clue 3, we know the person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house. From clue 7, we know the person who had stew does not live in the second house. This means the person who ate spaghetti and the person who had stew must live in the first and third houses, respectively.

From clue 5, we know the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. From clue 6, we know the person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. This means the person who is wearing boots must live in the first house, and the person who is wearing high heels must live in the third house.

From clue 1, we know the person who likes white lives in the first house. From clue 5, we know the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. This means the person who is wearing boots must be the person who likes white.

Now we have the following information:
- The person who likes white lives in the first house and is wearing boots.
- The person who likes green lives in the second house.
- The person who had stew lives in the third house and is wearing high heels.

The only person left is the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house, and the person who had stew lives in the third house, the person who ate fried rice must live in the second house.

Therefore, the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house. The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
2. The romance book lover lives to the right of the person with carnations.
3. The romance book lover lives to the left of the person with tulips.
4. The person with the rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live next to each other.
5. The person with the rose bouquet lives in the second house.

From clue 5, we know the person with the rose bouquet lives in house 2. Since the person with the rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live next to each other, the science fiction book fanatic must live in house 3.

From clue 2, the romance book lover lives to the right of the person with carnations. Since the person with the rose bouquet lives in house 2 and the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 3, the person with carnations must live in house 1.

From clue 3, the romance book lover lives to the left of the person with tulips. Since the person with the rose bouquet lives in house 2 and the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 3, the person with tulips must live in house 4.

Now, we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: person with carnations
- House 2: person with rose bouquet
- House 3: science fiction book fanatic
- House 4: person with tulips

The only person left is the fantasy book enthusiast, who must live in house 4. However, we already have a person with tulips in house 4. This means our initial assumption about the person with tulips was incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the information.

From clue 1, the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 3, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in house 2. However, we already have a person with a rose bouquet in house 2. This means the fantasy book enthusiast must live in house 1.

Now, we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: fantasy book enthusiast
- House 2: person with rose bouquet
- House 3: science fiction book fanatic
- House 4: person with tulips

From clue 2, the romance book lover lives to the right of the person with carnations. Since the person with carnations lives in house 1, the romance book lover must live in house 2. However, we already have a person with a rose bouquet in house 2. This means the romance book lover must live in house 3.

Now, we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: fantasy book enthusiast
- House 2: person with rose bouquet
- House 3: romance book lover
- House 4: person with tulips

From clue 3, the romance book lover lives to the left of the person with tulips. Since the romance book lover lives in house 3, the person with tulips must live in house 4.

The person with lilies is the only one left, and they must live in house 1."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The coffee drinker lives to the left of the person wearing sandals.
2. The science fiction book fanatic lives in the first house.

From clue 2, we know the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 1. Since the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person wearing sandals, and the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 1, the coffee drinker must live in house 1.

Now, we know the coffee drinker lives in house 1 and the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 1. This means the person wearing sandals must live in house 2.

The only person left is the romance book lover. Since the coffee drinker lives in house 1, the romance book lover must live in house 2.

So, the romance book lover lives in house 2."
"Let's think about this. 

We know the percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a radio. This means the person who has a radio lives in house 2. 

Since the pianist lives in house 1, and the percussionist lives in house 2, the person who has a phone must live in house 1. 

So, the answer is (A) 1."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.
3. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.

From clue 1, we know the person who drives a convertible lives in house 2.

From clue 3, we know the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. This means the person who likes yellow cannot live in house 2 (because the person who drives a convertible lives in house 2). So, the person who likes yellow must live in either house 1 or 3.

From clue 2, we know there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives. This means the person who likes white cannot live in house 2 (because the person who drives a convertible lives in house 2). So, the person who likes white must live in either house 1 or 3.

Now, let's combine the information. If the person who likes yellow lives in house 1, then the person who owns a sedan must live in house 3, and the person who likes white must live in house 2. But this contradicts clue 1, which says the person who drives a convertible lives in house 2. So, the person who likes yellow cannot live in house 1.

Therefore, the person who likes yellow must live in house 3."

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
2. The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
3. The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.
4. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house. From clue 4, we know the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house. This means the fantasy book enthusiast must be the person who ate fried rice.

From clue 2, we know the person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the fantasy book enthusiast (who ate fried rice) lives in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the first house.

From clue 1, we know the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the fantasy book enthusiast (who ate fried rice) lives in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house.

So, the order is:
- Science fiction book fanatic (1st house)
- Fantasy book enthusiast (2nd house)
- Person who ate fried rice (2nd house) - This is incorrect, as the person who ate fried rice is the fantasy book enthusiast.
- Person who ate spaghetti (1st house) - This is incorrect, as the person who ate spaghetti is the science fiction book fanatic.

Let's re-evaluate the clues:
- Science fiction book fanatic (1st house)
- Fantasy book enthusiast (2nd house) - This is incorrect, as the fantasy book enthusiast is the person who ate fried rice.
- Person who ate fried rice (2nd house) - This is incorrect, as the person who ate fried rice is the fantasy book enthusiast.
- Person who ate spaghetti (2nd house) - This is incorrect, as the person who ate spaghetti is the science fiction book fanatic.

Let's re-evaluate the clues again:
- Science fiction book fanatic (1st house)
- Person who ate spaghetti (2nd house)
- Person who ate fried rice (3rd house)

The correct order is:
- Science fiction book fanatic (1st house)
- Person who ate spaghetti (2nd house)
- Person who ate fried rice (3rd house)

Since the person who ate grilled cheese is not mentioned in the clues, we can't determine the house number of the person who ate grilled cheese."
"Let's think about this. 

We know that the person with the carnations lives to the left of the dog owner. We also know that there are only two houses, so the person with the carnations can't live in house 2. 

So, the person with the carnations must live in house 1."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   This means the person who is wearing high heels cannot be in house 1 because the person who only drinks water lives directly left of them.

2. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
   This means the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 1 because the person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of them.

3. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.
   This means the person who is eating kiwis is in house 2.

From clue 2, we know the person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who is eating kiwis is in house 2, the person who likes yellow must be in house 1.

From clue 1, we know the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who likes yellow is in house 1, the person who is wearing high heels must be in house 2.

So, the person who is wearing high heels lives in house 2."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person wearing sandals.
2. The person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals live next to each other.
3. The tea drinker lives to the left of the person with a television.

From clue 2, we know the person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals live next to each other. Since they live next to each other, they must be in houses 1 and 2, in that order (because the person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person wearing sandals).

From clue 3, the tea drinker lives to the left of the person with a television. Since the person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals are in houses 1 and 2, the tea drinker must be in house 1, and the person with a television must be in house 2.

Now, we know the person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person wearing sandals, and the person wearing high heels must be in house 1 (because the tea drinker is in house 1). The person wearing sandals must be in house 2.

The only person left is the one eating kiwis, who must be in house 1 (because the person wearing high heels is in house 1, and the person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals are in houses 1 and 2, respectively).

So, the person eating kiwis lives in house 1."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.
   - This means the water drinker can be in house 2 or 3.

2. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - This means the guitarist can be in house 1 or 3, and the violinist can be in house 2.

3. The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   - This means the tea drinker is in house 1.

4. The violinist does not live in the third house.
   - This means the violinist can be in house 1 or 2.

Combining the information:
- The tea drinker is in house 1.
- The violinist can be in house 1 or 2.
- The water drinker can be in house 2 or 3.
- The guitarist can be in house 1 or 3.

Considering clue 2, if the guitarist is in house 1, the violinist would be in house 3, which contradicts clue 4. So, the guitarist must be in house 3.

Therefore, the guitarist lives in house 3."

"Let's analyze the clues:

1. The cellist lives to the left of the mystery book reader.
2. The history book buff lives to the left of the cat lover.
3. The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other.

From clue 3, we know the root beer lover and the guitarist live next to each other. Since they can't be in the same house (clue 1), they must be in houses 1 and 2, in that order. 

Now, let's look at clue 2. The history book buff lives to the left of the cat lover. Since the cat lover can't be in house 1 (because the cellist lives there), the cat lover must be in house 2. The history book buff must be in house 1.

So, the order is:

- House 2: cat lover

Now, we know the cellist lives to the left of the mystery book reader. Since the history book buff lives in house 1, the cellist must live in house 2. The mystery book reader must live in house 1.

So, the order is: 
- House 1: history book buff, mystery book reader

- Person with tulips (right of dog owner, so it must be the third house)

Therefore, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in house 3."

- The person with a phone lives in the first house (since the person with a phone lives to the left of the person with sandals).
- The person with sandals lives in the fourth house (since the person with a phone lives in the first house).

- If the person who is wearing boots lives in the first house, then the person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house, which is not possible since the person with a computer lives in the second house.
- If the person who is wearing boots lives in the third house, then the person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house.

From clue 6, the person eating a banana lives directly left of the dog owner. Since the person eating mangos lives in house 1, the person eating a banana must live in house 2. But we already know the person eating kiwis lives in house 2. This means the person eating a banana cannot live in house 2. So, the person eating a banana must live in house 3.

From clue 4, the person eating a banana does not live in house 3. This is a contradiction. However, we can resolve this by re-evaluating the previous statements. Since the person eating a banana lives directly left of the dog owner, the person eating a banana must live in house 3, and the dog owner must live in house 4.

From clue 5, the person owning horses does not live in the second house. Since the person eating a banana lives in house 3, the person owning horses must live in house 1 or house 4. But we already know the person eating mangos lives in house 1. So, the person owning horses must live in house 4.

From clue 3, the bird keeper and the person eating kiwis live next to each other.

Now, let's look at the remaining clue 2. The person with high heels does not live in the second house. Since the first house is taken by the person with boots and daffodils, the person with high heels must live in the third house. But we already know the third house is occupied by the person with lilies. This means the person with high heels must live in the second house.

So, the person who is wearing boots lives in the first house. The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given clues and narrow down the possibilities.

From clue 1, we know the coffee drinker does not live in the fourth house.

From clue 2, the root beer lover lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.

From clue 3, the basketball player and the tennis player live directly next to each other. This means they can be in either the second and third houses or the fourth and fifth houses.

- The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels (clue 2). The root beer lover cannot be in the first house, so they must be in the second house.
- The high heels person cannot be in the last house, so they must be in the third house.

- The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker (clue 9). The water person cannot be in the last house (since the tea drinker must be to their right), so they must be in the first or second house. Since the spaghetti eater is in the first house, the water person must be in the second house.
- The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese (clue 10). The water person is already in the second house, so the grilled cheese person must be in the third house.
- The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water (clue 12). The root beer lover is in the second house, so the water person must be in the third house.

- House 3: Grilled cheese eater
- House 4: Boots person, basketball player, and tennis player

"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The cellist lives to the right of the cricketer.
2. The basketball player lives in the second house.
3. The violinist lives in the second house.

From clue 2 and 3, we know the second house is occupied by the basketball player and the violinist. Since the violinist lives in the second house, the basketball player must be in the second house as well.

Now, let's look at clue 1. The cellist lives to the right of the cricketer. Since the violinist is in the second house, the cellist must be in the third house. 

So, the order of the houses is: 
- Basketball player (2nd house)

The only person left is the soccer player, and since the basketball player is in the second house, the soccer player must be in the first house.

"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The tea drinker lives in the third house.
2. The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
3. The person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.
4. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
5. The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house.
6. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who likes green.
7. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.
8. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the person with carnations lives in the first house. From clue 7, we know the person wearing boots lives left of the person who likes green. From clue 6, we know the person wearing boots lives left of the person who likes green. So, the order of the first house is: carnations, boots, green.

From clue 5, we know the person with tulips lives in the second house. From clue 2, we know the person eating kiwis lives left of the person who likes blue. From clue 8, we know the person eating oranges does not live in the third house. So, the order of the second house is: tulips, kiwis, blue.

From clue 3, we know the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other. Since the person eating kiwis lives left of the person who likes blue, the order of the second house is: tulips, kiwis, blue. The person eating apples must live in the third house, but we know the tea drinker lives in the third house. So, the person eating apples must be the tea drinker.

From clue 1, we know the tea drinker lives in the third house. From clue 3, we know the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other. Since the tea drinker lives in the third house, the person eating apples must live in the second house.

So, the order of the houses is: 
- First house: carnations, boots, green
- Second house: tulips, kiwis, blue, apples
- Third house: tea drinker

The person eating apples lives in the second house, which is house number 2."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
2. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
3. The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.
4. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who has a television.

From clue 2, we know the mystery book reader lives in house 1.

From clue 1, the history book buff lives in house 2.

From clue 4, the person who has a television lives in house 3.

From clue 3, the person who has a computer lives in house 2 or 3. But we already know the history book buff lives in house 2, so the person who has a computer must live in house 3.

Now we have the order: 
- House 1: mystery book reader
- House 2: history book buff, computer
- House 3: person with a television

The only one left is the science fiction book fanatic, who must live in house 1, but we already know that's the mystery book reader. However, we can't have two people with the same characteristic in the same house. 

So, the science fiction book fanatic must live in house 2, but that's the house of the history book buff. This is a contradiction. 

However, re-examining the clues, we can see that the person with a phone must live in house 1, because the mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff, and the person with a computer lives to the right of the person with a phone. 

So, the correct order is:
- House 1: person with a phone, mystery book reader
- House 2: history book buff, computer
- House 3: person with a television, science fiction book fanatic

The science fiction book fanatic lives in house 3."
