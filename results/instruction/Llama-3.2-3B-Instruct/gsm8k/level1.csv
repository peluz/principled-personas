"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first calculate the total number of eggs she lays and then subtract the eggs she eats and bakes.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.

She bakes 4 muffins with 4 eggs each, so she uses 4 * 4 = 16 eggs for baking. However, she only has 13 eggs left, which is not enough for baking. This means she can only bake 13 / 4 = 3.25 muffins (we'll round down to 3 muffins since you can't bake a fraction of a muffin).

Now, let's calculate the number of eggs she sells at the market. She has 13 - 3 = 10 eggs left.

Since she sells each egg for $2, she makes 10 * 2 = $20 per day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $20"
"To find the total number of bolts needed, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fibers separately.

The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 
Since it takes half that much white fiber, we can calculate it as follows: 
2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.

Now, we add the amount of blue and white fibers together: 
2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

The total number of bolts needed is 3."
"To find the profit, we need to first calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original price of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%, so the new value is:

$80,000 + (150% of $80,000) 
= $80,000 + (1.5 * $80,000) 
= $80,000 + $120,000 
= $200,000

Now, we need to subtract the amount Josh spent on repairs ($50,000) from the new value of the house ($200,000) to find the profit:

$200,000 - $50,000 = $150,000

The profit Josh made is $150,000."
"To find the total meters James runs per week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in a week. 

Since James runs 3 sprints per session and he does this 3 times a week, the total number of sprints per week is 3 sessions * 3 sprints/session = 9 sprints.

Since each sprint is 60 meters, the total meters he runs per week is 9 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 540 meters.

"To determine the total amount of feed Wendi needs for her chickens, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she has given so far. 

In the morning, she gave 15 cups of feed to 20 chickens. 
In the afternoon, she gave 25 cups of feed to 20 chickens.

Total feed given so far = (15 cups * 20 chickens) + (25 cups * 20 chickens)
Total feed given so far = 300 cups + 500 cups
Total feed given so far = 800 cups

Since Wendi gives her chickens three meals a day, and she has already given them two meals, she needs to give them the remaining amount for the third meal.

Total feed needed for the day = Total feed given so far + Feed needed for the final meal
Total feed needed for the day = 800 cups + x

Since Wendi gives 3 cups of feed to each chicken per meal, and there are 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed for the final meal is:
3 cups * 20 chickens = 60 cups

Now we can set up an equation to solve for x:
800 cups + x = 800 cups + 60 cups
x = 60 cups

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 60 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The cost of the first glass is $5.

The cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

The cost of 15 glasses is 15 * $3 = $45.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses: $5 + $45 = $50.

The final answer is $50."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of sheep in Charleston and Toulouse. 

Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we can find the total number of sheep by adding the number of sheep in Seattle, Charleston, and Toulouse: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260.

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where Carla downloads 60% of the file, and the second part where she downloads the remaining 40% of the file.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download 60% of the file:

60% of 200 GB = 0.6 * 200 GB = 120 GB
Time to download 120 GB = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

Now, let's add the time it takes to restart the download:

Total time so far = 60 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes

Since Carla has to restart the download from the beginning, the remaining 40% of the file will take the same amount of time as the first part:

Time to download the remaining 40% = 40% of 200 GB = 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB
Time to download the remaining 80 GB = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

Total time = 80 minutes + 40 minutes = 120 minutes

Therefore, it takes Carla 120 minutes to download the file.

"To find the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

Then, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move. 

Next, he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.

Finally, he drives for 2 hours at 80 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 2 = 160 miles.

The total distance John has traveled is the sum of the distances traveled in each segment: 180 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles.

Since John started 180 miles away from home and traveled 355 miles, he is 355 - 180 = 175 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings would be:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours (45 - 40 = 5 hours), her earnings would be:
5 hours * $10/hour * 1.2 (overtime pay multiplier) = 5 * 10 * 1.2 = $60

Now, we add the earnings for the regular hours and the overtime hours:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

Now, we add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

The total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
3 dozen donuts * $68 per dozen = 3 * 68 = $204

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
2 dozen mini cupcakes * $80 per dozen = 2 * 80 = $160

Now, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
6 dozen mini cheesecakes * $55 per dozen = 6 * 55 = $330

Now, let's add the costs together:
$204 + $160 + $330 = $694

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year.

Initial cost of the tree: $90
Annual revenue from lemons: 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.50/year
Annual cost of maintenance: $3/year

Net profit per year: $10.50 (revenue) - $3 (cost) = $7.50/year

Since the initial cost of the tree is $90, we need to subtract this from the net profit to find the break-even point.

$7.50 (net profit) - $90 (initial cost) = -$82.50 (loss in the first year)

However, this means that in the first year, Carlos will incur a loss. We need to continue calculating the net profit for subsequent years until we reach a positive net profit.

Year 1: Loss of $82.50
Year 2: $7.50 (net profit) - $90 (initial cost) = -$82.50 (loss)

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as 'x'. 

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she has (2/3)x vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she has (2/3)x - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Next, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she has (1/2)((2/3)x - 2) vacuum cleaners left.

We are given that she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:

(1/2)((2/3)x - 2) = 5

To solve for x, we can start by multiplying both sides by 2:

(2/3)x - 2 = 10

Next, we can add 2 to both sides:

(2/3)x = 12

Now, we can multiply both sides by 3/2 to solve for x:

x = 18

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students
Number of students remaining = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the merchant's best choice, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option.

For the jewelry option:
Initial cost: $5,000
Market increase: 2.5%
Potential selling price: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,250
Profit: $5,250 - $5,000 = $250

For the electronic gadgets option:
Initial cost: $8,000
Market increase: 1.2%
Potential selling price: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,160
Profit: $8,160 - $8,000 = $160

Since the profit from the jewelry option ($250) is greater than the profit from the electronic gadgets option ($160), the merchant should choose the jewelry option to maximize profit."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered by each train on the first day (westward) and the distance covered by each train on the second day (northward).

Since both trains travel for the same amount of time, we can assume they maintain the same speed. Let's denote the speed of each train as 's'. 

On the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. This means they cover a total distance of 160 miles (80 miles each). Since they travel for the same amount of time, we can set up the equation:

80/s = 80/s

This equation is true for any value of 's', so we can't determine the exact speed of the trains. However, we can determine the total distance covered by each train on the first day, which is 80 miles.

On the second day, both trains travel 150 miles northward. The total distance covered by each train on the second day is 150 miles.

To find the total distance covered by each train in the two days, we add the distances covered on the first and second days:

Total distance = 80 + 150 = 230 miles

Since both trains travel the same distance, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her annual earnings from teaching:
Number of hours worked as a teacher per year = 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
Annual salary from teaching = 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her annual earnings from coaching:
Number of hours worked as a coach per year = 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
Annual salary from coaching = 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her annual earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
Total annual salary = Annual salary from teaching + Annual salary from coaching
Total annual salary = $35,000 + $22,500
Total annual salary = $57,500

"To find the total number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks would be 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Since Claire makes 3 eggs every morning, the total number of eggs she eats in 28 days is 3 * 28 = 84 eggs.

To convert this to dozens, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12 eggs). 

84 / 12 = 7

So, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks."
"To find the required speed for the remaining distance, we first need to calculate the total distance covered so far. Marissa has covered 4 miles and 2 miles, for a total of 6 miles.

Since she wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we can calculate the total time she needs to spend to achieve this average speed. 

Time = Total Distance / Average Speed
Time = 12 miles / 4 mph
Time = 3 hours

Since Marissa has already spent 2 hours (1 hour for the first 4 miles and 1 hour for the next 2 miles), she needs to spend 1 more hour to reach the total time of 3 hours.

Now, we can calculate the remaining distance:
Remaining Distance = Total Distance - Distance Covered
Remaining Distance = 12 miles - 6 miles
Remaining Distance = 6 miles

To find the required speed for the remaining distance, we can use the formula:
Required Speed = Distance / Time
Required Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Required Speed = 6 mph

The final answer is 6."
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks before and after spilling.

Initially, the orange drink is 2/3 water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

The total amount of water in both drinks initially is 20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = 49/3 liters.

When 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, the amount of water lost is 1 liter. So, the remaining amount of water is 49/3 - 1 = 48/3 = 16 liters.

The total volume of the mixture after spilling is 10 + 15 - 1 = 24 liters. 

The amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 16 liters.

"To find the age of Raymond's son, we need to first find Raymond's current age. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is 31, we can calculate Raymond's age as follows:

Raymond's age = Samantha's age - 6
Raymond's age = 31 - 6
Raymond's age = 25

Now, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find the age of the son, we subtract Raymond's age at the time of the son's birth from his current age:

Age of the son = Raymond's current age - Raymond's age at the time of the son's birth
Age of the son = 25 - 23
Age of the son = 2

Since we want to find out how many years ago the son was born, we subtract the son's age from the current year. However, we don't know the current year. We can find the difference in years between the current year and the year the son was born by subtracting the son's age from the current year. Since we don't know the current year, we can represent the difference as follows:

Years since the son's birth = Current year - Son's age
However, we can calculate the difference in years between the current year and the year the son was born by using the information that Raymond is 25 years old now and the son is 2 years old. We can represent the current year as 25 + 2 = 27. 

Years since the son's birth = Current year - Son's age
Years since the son's birth = 27 - 2
Years since the son's birth = 25

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total number of DVDs sold, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to each group of customers and then add them together.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought 3 DVDs in total.
The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs in total.
The last 3 customers bought 0 DVDs each, so they bought 0 DVDs in total.

Now, let's add the number of DVDs sold to each group: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7

Therefore, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"To find the total length of the candle that melts in 4 hours, we need to multiply the rate of melting (2 cm/hour) by the number of hours it burns.

Total length melted = 2 cm/hour * 4 hours = 8 cm

The candle will be 8 cm shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM."
"To find the original price of the book, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the original price as 'x'. 

Since Kyle got a 25% discount, the amount he paid is 75% of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%). 

We know that the amount Kyle paid is $19.50. So, we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To find the original price 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she has already ordered. 

The cost of the chicken meal is $12. 
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15. 
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6. 

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33. 

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the remaining amount she spent on pizza is $50 - $33 = $17. 

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, the number of boxes she ordered is $17 / $8.50 = 2.

The final answer is 2."
"To find the total amount Mishka spent, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing and then add them together.

The cost of 3 pairs of shorts is 3 * $16.50 = $49.50
The cost of 3 pairs of pants is 3 * $22.50 = $67.50
The cost of 3 pairs of shoes is 3 * $42 = $126

Now, let's add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243

Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items."
"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she will buy and the total cost.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will eat 60 servings in 60 days. 

Each carton has 15 servings, so the number of cartons she will buy is 60 / 15 = 4.

The cost of each carton is $4.00, so the total cost will be 4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00.

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days."
"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to determine the total distance he traveled before the second stop and then subtract the distance he traveled after the second stop.

Henry traveled 20 miles before the second stop. 

The total distance of the trip is 60 miles. Since his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, he traveled 60 - 15 = 45 miles after the second stop.

Now, we can find the distance between the first and second stops by subtracting the distance traveled before the second stop from the total distance traveled after the second stop.

Distance between first and second stops = Distance traveled after the second stop - Distance traveled before the second stop
= 45 - 20
= 25

The final answer is: 25"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the cost of the boots as B. We know that one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, so the cost of the second pair of heels is 2 * 33 = $66.

We are also given that the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. This can be expressed as:

33 + 66 = B - 5

Combine the costs of the heels:
99 = B - 5

Add 5 to both sides to isolate B:
99 + 5 = B
104 = B

The boots cost $104."
"To solve this problem, we can start by representing Darrell's and Allen's current ages as 7x and 11x, respectively, where x is a constant multiplier.

We know that their total age now is 162, so we can set up the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms:

18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age by multiplying 11x:

Allen's current age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is: 109"
"To find the average guess, we need to first calculate the number of guesses made by each person.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.

The second person says 20 more than half the first one. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 60.

The third person says 25% more than the first one. 25% of 80 is 20, and 20 more than that is 100.

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add these numbers together and divide by 3.

80 + 60 + 100 = 240

240 / 3 = 80

The average guess is 80."
"To find the total hours spent taking care of dogs per day, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time spent on each dog per day.

10 dogs * 0.5 hours/dog = 5 hours/day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily hours by 7:

5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

The final answer is: 35"
"To find the number of gold coins, we need to first determine the number of silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is 'x + 30'. 

We know that the total number of coins is 110. So, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 30) = 110.

Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 110.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the number of gold coins by adding 30: 40 + 30 = 70.

The final answer is 70."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

We know that Raymond has 40 jewels.

Since Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, we can calculate Aaron's jewels as follows:
Half of Raymond's jewels = 40 / 2 = 20
Aaron's jewels = 20 + 5 = 25

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. 
So, Siobhan's jewels = Aaron's jewels - 2
Siobhan's jewels = 25 - 2
Siobhan's jewels = 23

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total points scored, we need to calculate the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the points scored in the second 20 minutes.

Points scored in the first 20 minutes = 4
Points scored in the second 20 minutes = 4 + (25% of 4)
= 4 + (0.25 * 4)
= 4 + 1
= 5

Total points scored = Points scored in the first 20 minutes + Points scored in the second 20 minutes
= 4 + 5

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of yogurts he eats in 30 days and then multiply it by the cost per yogurt.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The sale is 4 yogurts for $5.00, so the cost per yogurt is $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.

Now, we multiply the total number of yogurts by the cost per yogurt: 60 yogurts * $1.25 = $75.00.

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"To find out how much money John had initially, we need to calculate the total amount he got from selling his Lego sets. 

He sold 13 Lego sets at $15 each, so the total amount he got is 13 * 15 = $195.

After buying 8 video games for $20 each, he spent 8 * 20 = $160.

He had $5 left, so the amount he spent on video games is $195 - $160 - $5 = $30.

Since he spent $30 on video games, he must have had $30 initially. 

Now, we need to find out how many Lego sets he had initially. We know he spent $30 on video games, so he must have had $195 - $30 = $165 initially.

Since he sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, we can find the number of Lego sets he had initially by dividing $165 by $15. 

165 / 15 = 11.

So, John initially had 11 Lego sets."
"To find John's average speed, we need to first calculate the total distance he runs in a week and the total time he spends running.

Distance run per day:
- Day 1: 3 hours
- Day 2: 3/2 = 1.5 hours
- Day 3: 1.5 hours
Total distance run per week = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 miles

Since John runs 3 days a week, the total distance run in a week is 6 miles.

To find his average speed, we need to know the total time he spends running in a week. 
Total time spent running = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 6 miles / 6 hours
Average speed = 1 mile per hour

The final answer is 1."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running speed and walking speed. 

Since Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and her skipping speed is half of her running speed, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. So, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, we need to find out how much time Dana spends running and walking in six hours. She spends one-third of the time running, which is 6 / 3 = 2 hours. She spends two-thirds of the time walking, which is 6 - 2 = 4 hours.

Now, we can calculate the distance Dana travels by running and walking in six hours. 

Distance traveled by running = speed * time = 6 * 2 = 12 miles
Distance traveled by walking = speed * time = 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles

Total distance traveled = 12 + 6 = 18 miles

The final answer is: 18"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the age of Brandon's iPhone in relation to Suzy's iPhone. 

We know that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, we can calculate Ben's iPhone age as follows: 
Ben's iPhone age = 2 * Suzy's iPhone age
Ben's iPhone age = 2 * 1
Ben's iPhone age = 2 years

Now, we know that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. Therefore, we can calculate Brandon's iPhone age as follows:
Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * Ben's iPhone age
Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * 2
Brandon's iPhone age = 8 years

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone. 

Let's denote the distance Polly can throw the javelin without the gemstone as 'x'. Since she can throw the javelin three times farther with the gemstone, the distance with the gemstone would be 3x.

We know that the maximum distance the dragon can breathe fire is 1000 feet, and Polly can throw the javelin within this distance. 

So, we can set up the equation: x + 3x = 1000

Combine like terms: 4x = 1000

Divide both sides by 4: x = 250

Now that we know Polly can throw the javelin 250 feet without the gemstone, we can find the distance with the gemstone: 3x = 3 * 250 = 750 feet

Since the dragon can breathe fire within 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1000 - 750 = 250 feet away from the dragon while holding the gemstone and still hit it with the gold javelin.

The final answer is: 250"
"To find the total number of pieces of pie taken by the guests, we need to first find the total number of pieces of pie initially available. 

There were 5 pies, each cut into 8 pieces, so the total number of pieces is 5 x 8 = 40.

At the end of the evening, 14 pieces were remaining. To find the number of pieces taken, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces: 40 - 14 = 26.

Therefore, the guests took 26 pieces of pie."
"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to first calculate the total calories available for consumption. 

You have already consumed 1800 calories, and your daily target is 2000 calories. So, the remaining calories available for consumption are 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since each serving has 250 calories, we can calculate the number of servings you can have left: 200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings.

Since each serving is 5 grams, we can calculate the total grams you can eat: 0.8 servings * 5 grams per serving = 4 grams.

"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each:
20 candles * $2.00 per candle = $40.00

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of making 20 candles. Since Charlie can make 10 candles per pound of beeswax, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax for 20 candles. The cost of beeswax and wicks for 2 pounds is $10.00. 

The total cost is $10.00.

Now, we can calculate the net profit:
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $10.00
Net profit = $30.00

The final answer is $30.00."
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply that by the average time it takes to write an article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is 5 * (2/5) = 2 more articles. So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles written:
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of Post-it notes Candice had initially and then subtract the number of notes she used at work.

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes in her purse.

At work, she used 220 Post-it notes on the cups of coffee.

Since she had 23 Post-it notes remaining, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Initial notes + Notes used - Remaining notes = Total notes

80 + 220 - x = 23

where x is the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased.

Combine like terms:

300 - x = 23

Subtract 300 from both sides:

-x = -277

Multiply both sides by -1:

x = 277

Therefore, the package she purchased contained 277 Post-it notes."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many blue ties John bought. We know that he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. 

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is 2 times the number of blue ties.
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
= 10

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie. 
Cost of each red tie = $40 + (50% of $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches and then divide it by the length of each piece.

There are 12 inches in 1 foot. So, 4 feet is equal to 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches):

48 ÷ 6 = 8

Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units, we first need to find the total number of units in the building. 

Since there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 units, the total number of units is 15 * 8 = 120.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is 3/4 * 120 = 90.

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units: 120 - 90 = 30.

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."

Distance = Speed * Time
Time = 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM)
Distance = 10 * 3 = 30 miles

Now, to find the time it takes for him to get back, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

The time it takes for Tom to get back is 5 hours."
"To find out how many pounds Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he is removing. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

30 * (1/4) = 30/4 = 7.5 pounds

Since Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total, the weight of the toys he needs to remove is:

15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Now, we know that each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we can divide the weight of the toys by the weight of each toy:

7.5 / (1/2) = 7.5 * 2 = 15

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

For the second half of the year, the company charges 10% less, which is $140 * 0.9 = $126. 

The total amount charged for the second half of the year is $126 * 6 = $756. 

Now, we add the amounts charged for both halves of the year: $840 + $756 = $1596. 

Therefore, Aleena paid a total of $1596 for the streaming service by the end of the year.

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the total capacity of her tank by the amount of gas she used to fill it up.

First, we need to find out how much gas is left in the tank after the last fill-up. We can do this by subtracting the amount of gas used (4 gallons) from the total capacity of the tank (12 gallons).

12 gallons (total capacity) - 4 gallons (used) = 8 gallons (left in the tank)

Since Sophia has already traveled 100 miles, we need to find out how many miles she can drive on the remaining 8 gallons of gas. To do this, we can divide the remaining gas by the miles per gallon (mpg) of her car.

However, we don't know the miles per gallon of her car. We can find this out by dividing the total distance she has traveled (100 miles) by the amount of gas used (4 gallons).

100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know the miles per gallon, we can multiply this by the remaining gas in the tank (8 gallons) to find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas.

25 miles per gallon * 8 gallons = 200 miles

Therefore, Sophia can drive 200 miles on a single tank of gas.

"To find the total hours spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the hours spent each week and then multiply it by 4.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV each time. He reads for half as long, which is 1 hour. 

So, the total hours spent on TV and reading each time is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent each week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

In 4 weeks, the total hours spent on TV and reading is 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total number of people sent by the schools, we need to calculate the number of teams and coaches.

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and there are 4 schools. So, the total number of teams is 2 teams/school * 4 schools = 8 teams.

Each team has 5 players, and there are 8 teams. So, the total number of players is 5 players/team * 8 teams = 40 players.

Each team has 1 coach, and there are 8 teams. So, the total number of coaches is 1 coach/team * 8 teams = 8 coaches.

Now, we add the total number of players and coaches to find the total number of people sent by the schools. Total people = 40 players + 8 coaches = 48 people.

"To find the total number of gems, we need to calculate the number of each type of gemstone and then add them together.

Let's start with the diamonds: 175 diamonds.

The number of rubies is 35 fewer than diamonds, so the number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140.

The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so the number of emeralds is 2 * 140 = 280.

Now, let's add the number of each type of gemstone together: 175 (diamonds) + 140 (rubies) + 280 (emeralds) = 595.

Therefore, there were 595 gems in the chest."
"To find the number of teachers, we first need to determine the total number of students. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, the number of boys is 2 * 60 = 120.

The total number of students is the sum of boys and girls, which is 120 + 60 = 180.

Since there are 5 students to every teacher, we can divide the total number of students by 5 to find the number of teachers. 

Number of teachers = Total number of students / 5
= 180 / 5
= 36

The final answer is 36."

"To calculate the total amount Shiela will pay each month, we need to first calculate the total cost of the cell phones and then add the interest.

The total cost of the cell phones is 5 units * $150 per unit = $750.

Since a 2% interest will be charged for each unit, the interest for each unit is 2% of $150, which is 0.02 * $150 = $3.

The total interest for 5 units is 5 * $3 = $15.

The total amount Shiela will pay each month is the cost of the cell phones plus the interest, which is $750 + $15 = $765.

To find the monthly payment, we divide the total amount by 3 months: $765 / 3 = $255.

So, Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months.

"To find the average square footage of each level, we need to first find the total square footage of all levels and then divide it by the number of levels.

The top level has a square footage of 16. Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can find the square footage of the other levels as follows:

Level 1 (top): 16
Level 2: 16 / 2 = 8
Level 3: 8 / 2 = 4
Level 4 (bottom): 4 / 2 = 2

Now, we add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30

There are 4 levels in total. To find the average, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels: 30 / 4 = 7.5

The average square footage of each level is 7.5."
"To find the total number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the amount of food used in the first 180 days and the amount used for the rest of the year.

For the first 180 days, Cecilia feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of food used in the first 180 days is 1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups.

For the rest of the year (365 - 180 = 185 days), Cecilia feeds the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day. So, the total amount of food used in the rest of the year is 2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups.

The total amount of food used in the first year is 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags used in the first year is 550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags.

The final answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much laundry David does. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can divide Sarah's laundry by 4 to find David's laundry.

Sarah's laundry = 400 pounds
David's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 4
David's laundry = 400 / 4
David's laundry = 100 pounds

Now, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. So, we can find Raymond's laundry by dividing Sarah's laundry by 2.

Raymond's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 2
Raymond's laundry = 400 / 2
Raymond's laundry = 200 pounds

The difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David is:
Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
Difference = 200 - 100
Difference = 100 pounds"
"To determine the better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in both packages.

For the 3-for-$2.50 package, we can calculate the cost as follows:
18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages
6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15

For the 2-for-$1 package, we can calculate the cost as follows:
18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages
9 packages * $1 per package = $9

Since $9 is less than $15, buying 18 flowers in the 2-for-$1 package is the better option.

The amount of money saved is $15 - $9 = $6.

The grooming cost after the discount is $70."
"To find out how much water was left, we first need to calculate the total amount of water the two girls got. Since they each got 1/6 of the 24 liters, we can calculate it as follows:

1/6 * 24 = 4 liters

So, the two girls got a total of 4 liters. 

Now, we add the 6 liters the boy got to the total the girls got:

4 + 6 = 10 liters

Since the total amount of water initially was 24 liters, we subtract the amount the boy got from the total:

24 - 10 = 14 liters

Therefore, 14 liters of water were left."
"To find out how many stickers Charlie has left, we need to calculate the total number of stickers he initially had, then subtract the stickers he gave away and used.

Charlie initially had 10 stickers. He bought 21 stickers, so he had 10 + 21 = 31 stickers.

Then, he got 23 stickers for his birthday, so now he had 31 + 23 = 54 stickers.

After giving 9 stickers to his sister, he had 54 - 9 = 45 stickers.

Finally, he used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so he had 45 - 28 = 17 stickers left.

Charlie has 17 stickers left."
"To find Alex's weight, we need to calculate 4 times Grace's weight and then subtract 2 pounds. 

First, we multiply 4 by Grace's weight: 4 * 125 = 500 pounds. 

Then, we subtract 2 pounds from that result: 500 - 2 = 498 pounds. 

Now, we add Alex's weight to Grace's weight: 125 + 498 = 623 pounds.

The combined weight of Grace and Alex is 623 pounds."

Total number of roses: 3 * 25 = 75
Total number of thorns: 75 * 8 = 600

The total number of thorns is 600."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic equation. Let's denote the number of games lost as 'x'. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won is 'x + 8'. 

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so the sum of the games won and lost is equal to 22. 

We can write the equation as: x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms: 2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2: x = 7

Since x represents the number of games lost, the number of games won is x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15.

The football team won 15 games."
"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the number of years Gene has been vacationing and multiply it by the number of shirts he has from each vacation.

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old and is now 34. So, the number of years he has been vacationing is 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since he goes on four vacations a year, the total number of shirts (and thus quilt blocks) is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 quilt blocks."
"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the duration of each ring and add them up.

The first time, the alarm rang for 4 times. 

The second time, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang for 4 * 3 = 12 times.

The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang for 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of times the alarm rang: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The alarm rang a total of 22 times."
"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate the increase in her salary for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial salary = $600
Increase = 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 1 year = $600 + $60 = $660

Year 2: 
Initial salary = $660
Increase = 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 2 years = $660 + $66 = $726

Year 3: 
Initial salary = $726
Increase = 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Salary after 3 years = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Year 4: 
Initial salary = $798.60
Increase = 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Salary after 4 years = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

Year 5: 
Initial salary = $878.46
Increase = 10% of $878.46 = 0.1 * $878.46 = $87.846
Salary after 5 years = $878.46 + $87.846 = $966.306

Year 6: 
Initial salary = $966.306
Increase = 10% of $966.306 = 0.1 * $966.306 = $96.6306
Salary after 6 years = $966.306 + $96.6306 = $1062.9366

Year 7: 
Initial salary = $1062.9366
Increase = 10% of $1062.9366 = 0.1 * $1062.9366 = $106.29366

"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount each adult and child will eat, then add those amounts together.

Since an adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child eats half as much, a child will eat 10 / 2 = 5 lbs of potato salad.

There are 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic. 

The total amount of potato salad needed for the adults is 20 * 10 = 200 lbs.
The total amount of potato salad needed for the children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amounts for adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

"To solve this problem, we need to start with the information about Cindy's pets. Since Cindy has four pets, we can use this as a reference point.

Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

Now, we can add up the number of pets each person has to find the total number of pets: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

The total number of pets the three have is 28."
"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey. 

Since James is 1 year younger than Corey, Corey's age is 10 + 1 = 11 years.

We also know that Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy's age is 11 - 2 = 9 years.

Lastly, Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson's age is 9 - 5 = 4 years.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how long it took Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change. 

Let's denote Gerald's original time as 'x'. Since Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, Lee's time would be x + 2. We know that Lee's time is 38 seconds, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 38

Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us:

x = 36

This means Gerald's original time was 36 seconds.

Now, we know Gerald's speed improved by 10%. To find his new time, we need to calculate 10% of his original time and add it to his original time.

10% of 36 seconds is 0.1 * 36 = 3.6 seconds.

Adding this to his original time, we get:

36 + 3.6 = 39.6 seconds

So, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 39.6 seconds with his improved diet."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, we can multiply the number of dogs by 2 to find the number of cats.

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
= 2 * 60
= 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we need to add the number of dogs and cats and then subtract 12.

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 60 + 120
= 180

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
= 180 - 12
= 168

Total number of pets in the neighborhood = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits

9 hours (Harry's sleep) - 6 hours (James' sleep) = 3 hours.

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To find the number of tomatoes used, we need to first determine the total number of ounces of tomatoes used. Since the sauce made 32 ounces and they lost half their volume, the original amount of tomatoes used must be twice the amount of sauce.

32 ounces (sauce) / 0.5 = 64 ounces (original tomatoes)

Since each 16-ounce can contains 3 tomatoes, we can divide the total number of ounces by 16 to find the number of cans used:

64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans

Now, multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can:

4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes

The final answer is 12."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam. We know that 5 cars took an exit, so the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

We also know that 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes, and the total time for the traffic jam is 30 minutes. Since 20 cars drove through in the last 15 minutes, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes can be found by subtracting the number of cars that drove through in the last 15 minutes from the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as x. We can set up the equation:

x + 20 = 25

Subtracting 20 from both sides gives us:

x = 5

Therefore, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1 hour each night, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours. 

The total time watched on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours. 

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time he watched on Wednesday can be found by subtracting the time watched on the other days from the total time. 

7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours. 

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes. 

1.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 90 minutes. 

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we can divide 90 minutes by 30 minutes to find the number of episodes. 

90 minutes / 30 minutes = 3 episodes."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x.

Since Henry wants to make twice as many cookies this year, he will bake 2x cookies this year.

However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked this year is 2x + 15.

He drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has left is 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10.

We are given that the number of cookies he has left is 110, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To calculate the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of the gas and then subtract the cashback amount.

The cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon is:
10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

The cashback amount is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons:
10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

Now, subtract the cashback amount from the total cost:
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00."
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups, we need to calculate the area of each roll-up and then multiply it by the number of rolls.

Beatrice's roll-up: 2 roll-ups wide * 24 rolls up long = 48 roll-ups
Marcell's roll-up: 3 roll-ups wide * 14 rolls up long = 42 roll-ups

Total number of roll-ups: 48 + 42 = 90

Since they both ate their entire amount, we can divide the total number of roll-ups by 2 to find the average:

90 / 2 = 45

The average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice is 45."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many feet Julia rows per second. 

Since it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find her rate of rowing as follows:

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 20 feet / 16 seconds
Rate = 1.25 feet/second

Now, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet it rows. To find out how much water it takes on per second, we can divide 2 liters by 10 feet and then multiply by the rate of rowing:

Water per second = (2 liters / 10 feet) * 1.25 feet/second
Water per second = 0.25 liters/second

Since Julia is 64 seconds away from the shore, we can multiply the water taken on per second by the time it takes her to reach the shore:

Total water taken on = Water per second * Time
Total water taken on = 0.25 liters/second * 64 seconds
Total water taken on = 16 liters

The final answer is 16."
"To find the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to calculate the total number of lessons and then multiply it by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

Each teacher has 2 lessons per day, and there are 4 teachers. So, the total number of lessons per day is 2 * 4 = 8.

Since the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is 8 * 3 = 24.

The whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day."
"To find the total number of flowers Ryan has, we need to calculate the total number of flowers he planted and subtract the ones that did not grow.

Ryan plants 2 flowers a day, so in 15 days, he would have planted 2 * 15 = 30 flowers.

However, 5 of those flowers did not grow. To find the total number of flowers that grew, we subtract the ones that did not grow from the total number of flowers planted: 30 - 5 = 25.

So, Ryan has 25 flowers in his garden."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo as 'x'. 

Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, and Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we can set up the equation:

6 * Brittany's phone capacity = 1800

To find Brittany's phone capacity, we divide both sides by 6:

Brittany's phone capacity = 1800 / 6
Brittany's phone capacity = 300

Now, we are given that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. We can set up the equation:

Brittany's phone capacity = 50 * x

Since we know Brittany's phone capacity is 300, we can set up the equation:

300 = 50 * x

To find 'x', we divide both sides by 50:

x = 300 / 50
x = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

"To calculate the profit, we need to first find the total cost of the lumber and then subtract the total selling price.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 = $100.

The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80.

The total cost is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 + ($10 * 0.5) = $15 each.

The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 + ($16 * 0.5) = $24 each.

The total selling price is 10 * $15 + 5 * $24 = $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we need to determine the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 7 + 13 = 20 parts. 

Since the total amount of sugar used is 120 teaspoons, we can divide 120 by the total number of parts (20) to find the value of one part. 

120 / 20 = 6

Now, we multiply the value of one part (6) by the number of parts of sugar (7) to find the total amount of sugar used.

6 * 7 = 42

Therefore, Katy used 42 teaspoons of sugar."
"To find the total amount John paid, we need to calculate the total number of pairs of shoes he bought and multiply it by the cost of each pair.

John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children, so the total number of pairs is 2 * 3 = 6 pairs.

Each pair costs $60, so the total amount John paid is 6 * 60 = $360.

$360"
"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to first find the total number of vehicles already present at the port on the first day. 

There were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles on the second day is 30. To find the number of vehicles added, we subtract the number of vehicles on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can divide the number of vehicles added (20) by 5 to find the number of containers imported on the second day: 20 / 5 = 4.

Therefore, 4 containers were imported on the second day."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate Adrien's and Lylah's current salaries and then add them together.

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 30% four years ago, we can calculate his current salary as follows:

Current salary = $40,000 + (30% of $40,000)
= $40,000 + 0.3 * $40,000
= $40,000 + $12,000
= $52,000

Now, we know Adrien's current salary is $52,000. Since his salary increased by 40% four years later, we can calculate his current salary as follows:

Current salary = $52,000 + (40% of $52,000)
= $52,000 + 0.4 * $52,000
= $52,000 + $20,800
= $72,800

Now that we know Adrien's current salary, we can calculate Lylah's current salary. Since Adrien's salary is 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up the following equation:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30%
$72,800 = Lylah's salary + 0.3 * Lylah's salary
$72,800 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $72,800 / 1.3
= $56,000

Now that we know both Adrien's and Lylah's current salaries, we can calculate their total salary four years later:

Total salary = Adrien's salary + Lylah's salary
= $72,800 + $56,000
= $128,800

The final answer is: $128,800"
"To find the total number of sheets of paper Miguel uses in a month, we need to calculate the number of sheets he uses in a week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a month.

Kael brought twice the amount of apples, which is 2 * 5 = 10 apples. He also brought half the number of oranges, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges. So, the total number of fruits Kael brought is 10 + 4 = 14.

Now, we add the total number of fruits Morisette and Kael brought: 13 + 14 = 27.

The total number of fruits they have is 27."
"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate the hours she slept each day.

On Monday, she slept 8 hours.
On Tuesday, she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours.
On Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less than Tuesday, so she slept 6 - 2 = 4 hours.
On Thursday, she slept 1 hour more than Wednesday, so she slept 4 + 1 = 5 hours.
On Friday, she slept 1 hour more than Thursday, so she slept 5 + 1 = 6 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours she slept each day:
8 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 29

The total hours Sadie slept throughout the week is 29."
"To find out how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down her running time into two segments: the first 3 hours and the remaining 4 hours.

In the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour. So, she covers a distance of 3 * 10 = 30 miles.

In the remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour. So, she covers a distance of 4 * 5 = 20 miles.

To find the total distance covered in 7 hours, we add the distances covered in both segments: 30 + 20 = 50 miles.

The final answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many letters Jennie stamped. Since she put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of letters needing stamps = 60
Number of letters stamped = (1/3) * 60 = 20

Now, we know that after stamping 20 letters, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. To find the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, we can subtract the number of letters stamped from the current number of letters in the pile:

Initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters = Current number of letters in the pile - Number of letters stamped
= 30 - 20
= 10

Therefore, Jennie had 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when she began.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought as 'x'. 

Initially, Julia had 0 spoons. Then, she bought a package of 'x' spoons, so she had x spoons. 

Her husband gave her 5 more spoons, so now she had x + 5 spoons. 

She used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so she was left with x + 5 - 3 = x + 2 spoons. 

We are given that she had a total of 12 spoons when she set the table. 

So, we can set up the equation: x + 2 = 12.

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: x = 12 - 2.

x = 10.

The final answer is 10."
"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages. 

First, we know Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. 
Since he bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, we can calculate the number of fish sausages by adding 6 to the number of chicken sausages: 
38 (chicken sausages) + 6 = 44 fish sausages.

Now, we can find the total number of sausages by adding the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages: 
38 (chicken sausages) + 44 (fish sausages) = 82 sausages.

The total number of sausages Dylan bought is 82."

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to first find the cost of each item.

Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs 15$, a watermelon costs 3 * 15 = 45$.

An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so an orange costs 45 - 5 = 40$.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each item:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * 45 = 180$
- 20 peppers: 20 * 15 = 300$
- 10 oranges: 10 * 40 = 400$

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is 180 + 300 + 400 = 880$."
"To calculate the profit, we need to first calculate the total time spent on each patient and the total revenue from patients and the total cost of the doctors' time.

Total time spent on each patient = 24 minutes
Total minutes in an hour = 60 minutes
Total time spent on each patient in hours = 24 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 0.4 hours

Total time spent on all patients in a day = 500 patients * 0.4 hours/patient = 200 hours

Total revenue from patients = 500 patients * $200/patient = $100,000

Total cost of doctors' time = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

Profit = Total revenue from patients - Total cost of doctors' time
Profit = $100,000 - $30,000
Profit = $70,000

Initially, Nissa hires 60 elves.

A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. 
A third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20 elves. 
So, 20 elves quit, leaving 60 - 20 = 40 elves.

"To solve this problem, we can start by using variables to represent the number of bees. Let's say the number of queens is Q, the number of baby bees is B, and the number of worker bees is W.

We are given the following information:

1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: W = 2B
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: B = 2Q
3. The total number of bees is 700: W + B + Q = 700

We can substitute the first two equations into the third equation to get:

2B + B + Q = 700
3B + Q = 700

Now, we can substitute B = 2Q into the equation:

3(2Q) + Q = 700
6Q + Q = 700
7Q = 700

Dividing both sides by 7, we get:

Q = 100

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees:

B = 2Q
B = 2(100)
B = 200

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees:

W = 2B
W = 2(200)
W = 400

Therefore, there are 400 worker bees in the hive.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. 

In the next 6 hours, half of those bees return, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.

So, the total number of bees that have returned after the first 12 hours is 30 (initially returned) + 15 (returned in the next 6 hours) = 45 bees.

In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as initially left (30) leave the hive, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.

Now, we need to find out how many of these 60 bees have already returned. We know that 45 bees had returned before this point. So, 60 - 45 = 15 bees from the second wave of 60 bees have not returned yet.

In the last 6 hours, all the remaining bees that left before the second wave (60) return. Since 15 bees from the second wave have not returned, and 30 bees initially left, the total number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is 30 (initially returned) + 15 (remaining from the second wave) = 45 bees.

Therefore, Debra sees 45 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, Charlie's friends can be represented as 3x. 
We are given that Charlie has 12 friends, so we can set up the equation: 
3x = 12

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 3: 
x = 12 / 3 
x = 4 

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' friends by multiplying Dorothy's friends by 4, since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy: 
James' friends = 4 * 4 
James' friends = 16 

The final answer is 16."
"To determine the winner and the waiting time, we need to calculate the time it takes for each person to reach home.

First, we need to convert the distance to the same units as the speed. Since the speed is given in feet per minute, we'll convert the distance to feet. 

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each person to reach home:

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes to reach home, and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will be the winner. 

The waiting time for the loser (Tim) is the difference between their times: 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the cost of inflating the tires for each type of vehicle and then add them together.

For bicycles: 5 people * 2 tires * 25 cents = 5 * 2 * 0.25 = $1.50
For tricycles: 3 people * 3 tires * 25 cents = 3 * 3 * 0.25 = $2.25
For the unicycle: 1 person * 1 tire * 25 cents = 1 * 1 * 0.25 = $0.25

Now, let's add the amounts together: $1.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $4.00

The final answer is: $4.00"
"To find the total number of cookies Carl bought, we multiply the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack: 10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies.

The total cost of the cookies is the number of cookies multiplied by the cost per cookie: 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.

Since Carl paid with a $10 bill, we subtract the total cost from the $10 bill to find the change: $10 - $6 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. The total fries eaten so far are 14 (Dave) + 7 (seagull) = 21 fries.
4. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, so 3 * 3 = 9 fries were eaten by the pigeons.
5. The total fries eaten so far are 21 (previous) + 9 (pigeons) = 30 fries.
6. The raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is 2/3 * (30 - 2) = 2/3 * 28 = 18.67 fries. Since we can't have a fraction of a fry, we'll round down to 18 fries (as you can't eat a fraction of a fry).
7. The total fries eaten so far are 30 (previous) + 18 (raccoon) = 48 fries.
8. The ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 48 - 1 = 47 fries.

However, we know that 5 fries were left behind. This means that the initial number of fries in the pack must be 47 (remaining) + 5 (left behind) = 52 fries.

The final answer is: 52"
"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the total hours for each type of day and then add them together.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so that's 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 of these days in a week, the total hours for these days is 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 of these days in a week, the total hours for these days is 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week.

Now, we need to calculate the total hours for the entire semester. There are 16 weeks in a semester, so we multiply the weekly hours by 16:

9 hours/week * 16 weeks = 144 hours
8 hours/week * 16 weeks = 128 hours

Adding these together, we get:
144 hours + 128 hours = 272 hours

Therefore, Kimo spends 272 hours attending classes in one semester.

The final answer is: 272"
"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit, feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

- Each roll is 4 inches long, which is 4/12 = 1/3 feet long.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long, which is 6/12 = 1/2 feet long.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Total length of rolls: 300 rolls * 1/3 feet/roll = 100 feet
- Total length of croissants: 120 croissants * 1/2 feet/croissant = 60 feet
- Total length of baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet

Now, let's add the total lengths together: 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet.

The total length of the baked goods is 280 feet."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order, we need to calculate the total monthly demand and then multiply it by 2.

The total monthly demand is the sum of the demand of all the apes: 
- Monkeys: 200 bananas
- Gorillas: 400 bananas
- Baboons: 100 bananas
Total monthly demand = 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas

Since the zookeeper orders every 2 months, we need to multiply the total monthly demand by 2:
Total bananas needed for 2 months = 700 * 2 = 1400 bananas

The final answer is: 1400"
"To determine the total distance each person ran, we need to calculate the distance covered by each of them.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he runs back and forth, the total distance covered by Blake is 2 * 15 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, covering a distance of 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, covering an additional 2 * (100 - 40) = 120 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance covered by Kelly is 200 + 120 * 34 = 200 + 4080 = 4280 yards.

Since Blake ran 3000 yards and Kelly ran 4280 yards, Kelly is the winner. The difference in distance between the winner and the loser is 4280 - 3000 = 1280 yards.

"To find the total amount Raphael spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 4 pens is 4 x $1.5 = $6.
The cost of 2 notebooks is 2 x $4 = $8.
The cost of the bond paper is $20.

Now, let's add the costs together: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

Raphael spent $34 on everything."
"To find the number of tadpoles Finn can see, we need to subtract the number of tadpoles that came out of hiding from the total number of tadpoles initially, and then add the number of tadpoles that hid under the rock.

Initially, Finn saw 11 tadpoles.
6 tadpoles came out of hiding, so we subtract 6 from 11: 11 - 6 = 5
Then, 2 tadpoles hid under the rock, so we add 2 to 5: 5 + 2 = 7

Therefore, Finn can see 7 tadpoles in the pond now.

"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow the given information step by step.

On Monday, the tank had a depth of 17 feet.

On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find this, we multiply the depth on Tuesday by 2/3.

Depth on Wednesday = (2/3) * 24
Depth on Wednesday = 16 feet

The final answer is 16."
"To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin, we need to calculate the number of fish each of them caught.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the number of fish caught by each of them:
Anakin: 10 (starfish) + 6 (sea horses) + 3 (clownfish) = 19 fish
Locsin: 5 (starfish) + 3 (sea horses) + 5 (clownfish) = 13 fish

Total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin: 19 + 13 = 32 fish.

"To calculate the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to apply the 20% increase every two months.

Initial cost = $20
Increase after 2 months = 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4
Cost after 2 months = $20 + $4 = $24

Increase after 4 months = 20% of $24 = 0.20 * $24 = $4.80
Cost after 4 months = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80

Increase after 6 months = 20% of $28.80 = 0.20 * $28.80 = $5.76
Cost after 6 months = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56

Increase after 8 months = 20% of $34.56 = 0.20 * $34.56 = $6.91
Cost after 8 months = $34.56 + $6.91 = $41.47

Increase after 10 months = 20% of $41.47 = 0.20 * $41.47 = $8.29
Cost after 10 months = $41.47 + $8.29 = $49.76

Increase after 12 months = 20% of $49.76 = 0.20 * $49.76 = $9.95
Cost after 12 months = $49.76 + $9.95 = $59.71

Increase after 14 months = 20% of $59.71 = 0.20 * $59.71 = $11.94
Cost after 14 months = $59.71 + $11.94 = $71.65

Increase after 16 months = 20% of $71.65 = 0.20 * $71.65 = $14.33
Cost after 16 months = $71.65 + $14.33 = $85.98

Increase after 18 months = 20% of $85.98 = 0.20 * $85.98 = $17.20
Cost after 18 months = $85.98 + $17.20 = $103.18

Increase after 20 months = 20% of $103.18 = 0.20 * $103.18 = $20.64
Cost after 20 months = $103.18 + $20.64 = $123.82

Increase after 22 months = 20% of $123.82 = 0.20 * $123.82 = $24.76
Cost after 22 months = $123.82 + $24.76 = $148.58

Increase after 24 months = 20% of $148.58 = 0.20 * $148.58 = $29.72
Cost after 24 months = $148.58 + $29.72 = $178.30

Increase after 26 months = 20% of $178.30 = 0.20 * $178.30 = $35.66
Cost after 26 months = $178.30 + $35.66 = $213.96

Increase after 28 months = 20% of $213.96 = 0.20 * $213.96 = $42.79
Cost after 28 months = $213.96 + $42.79 = $256.75

Increase after 30 months = 20% of $256.75 = 0.20 * $256.75 = $51.55
Cost after 30 months = $256.75 + $51.55 = $308.30

Increase after 32 months = 20% of $308.30 = 0.20 * $308.30 = $61.66

"To find the total value of all the toys, we need to first determine the cost of each type of toy.

We know that one red car costs $4. Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and an action figure costs $5, the doll costs 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, we have the cost of one red car ($4) and the doll ($15). We also know there are 5 red cars. 

The total cost of the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

The total cost of the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

The total cost of the doll is $15.

Now, we add the costs of all the toys to find the total value: $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) + $15 (doll) = $50.

The total value of all the toys is $50."
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the income she would have earned by doing her taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the income she would have earned by doing her taxes herself. If she loses $35/hour, and she would have done 3 fewer hours of freelance work, we need to know how many hours she would have worked. However, the problem doesn't provide the total number of hours she would have worked. 

Let's denote the number of hours she would have worked as 'x'. Then, the income she would have earned by doing her taxes herself is 35x.

The cost of hiring the accountant is $90.

The difference in income is the income she would have earned minus the cost of hiring the accountant: 35x - 90.

However, without knowing the number of hours she would have worked, we cannot calculate the exact difference in income."
"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer accessories she purchased.

The total cost of the accessories is the sum of the costs of the machine, scanner, CD burner, and printer.

Total cost = Cost of machine + Cost of scanner + Cost of CD burner + Cost of printer
Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102
Total cost = €1403

Now, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from Elvira's budget to find out how much money she will have left for her clothing.

Money left for clothing = Budget - Total cost
Money left for clothing = €1500 - €1403
Money left for clothing = €97

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can express this as S = 2B.

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This can be expressed as (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Substituting S = 2B into the equation, we get (2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Combine like terms: 3B + 4 = 28.

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3B = 24.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 8.

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into S = 2B, which gives us S = 2(8) = 16.

The final answer is 16."

"To find the total miles walked in a week, we need to calculate the miles walked on weekdays and weekends separately.

Weekdays: There are 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday) in a week. Pancho walks 20 miles per day on these days, so the total miles walked on weekdays is 5 * 20 = 100 miles.

Weekends: There are 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) in a week. Pancho walks 10 miles per day on these days, so the total miles walked on weekends is 2 * 10 = 20 miles.

Total miles walked in a week = miles walked on weekdays + miles walked on weekends

Rare mutant invertebrates have 3 invertebrates with 10 legs each, so the total number of invertebrate legs is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we add the total number of legs of each type together: 640 (spider legs) + 540 (insect legs) + 30 (invertebrate legs) = 1210.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we can find the total age of the four birds by adding their ages: 8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) + 8 (Sally Thirty-two) = 51.

The total age of the four birds is 51."

"To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to first calculate the total revenue and total cost.

Let's start by calculating the total revenue. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Since they made $25 in profit, and profit is the difference between revenue and cost, we can set up an equation:

Revenue - Cost = Profit
$10 * 20 (revenue per gallon) - Cost = $25

Let's simplify the equation:
$200 - Cost = $25

Now, we can solve for the cost:
Cost = $200 - $25
Cost = $175

However, this is the total cost for 20 gallons. To find the cost for lemons, we need to know the cost per gallon. The cost for lemons is $3 per gallon. 

Cost of lemons per gallon = $3
Total gallons = 20
Total cost of lemons = $3 * 20
Total cost of lemons = $60

Next, let's calculate the amount he spends on car fuel: 
1/3 of 6000 = 0.33 * 6000 = 2000

Now, let's calculate the total amount spent so far:

"To find the number of votes the loser got, we need to first find the number of votes the winner got. 

Since the winner got 3/4 of the total votes, we can calculate the number of votes the winner got by multiplying the total number of votes by 3/4.

Number of votes the winner got = (3/4) * 80

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of red roses, white carnations, and pink calla lilies. 

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses is 4x. 

We also know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, so the number of pink calla lilies is 5x.

The total number of items ordered is the sum of the red roses, white carnations, and pink calla lilies. Since we don't have any information about other items, we can assume that the total number of items ordered is the sum of these three. 

So, the total number of items ordered is x + 4x + 5x = 10x.

However, we are not given the total number of items ordered, but we know that Sandra has threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm. This implies that the number of missing red roses is the difference between the total number of items ordered and the number of items that have been delivered so far.

Since we don't have any information about the number of items delivered, we can't calculate the exact number of missing red roses. However, we can express the number of missing red roses in terms of 'x'. The number of missing red roses is 10x - (number of items delivered).

To find the number of red roses that must be delivered by 5 pm, we need to know the number of items delivered. However, we can express the number of red roses that must be delivered in terms of 'x'. The number of red roses that must be delivered is 4x - (number of items delivered).

Since we can't calculate the exact number of missing red roses, we can't calculate the exact number of red roses that must be delivered. However, we can express the number of red roses that must be delivered in terms of 'x'."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote Jan's current age as J, Mark's current age as M, and Jean's current age as E.

We are given that Jean is two years older than Mark, so we can write an equation: E = M + 2.

We are also given that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Two years ago, Mark's age was M - 2, and half Jan's age two years ago was J/2 - 2. So, we can write another equation: M - 2 = (J/2) - 2 + 5.

We are given that Jan is 30 years old, so we can substitute J = 30 into the second equation: M - 2 = (30/2) - 2 + 5.

Simplifying the equation, we get: M - 2 = 15 - 2 + 5, which simplifies to M - 2 = 18.

Adding 2 to both sides, we get: M = 20.

Now that we know Mark's age, we can find Jean's age using the first equation: E = M + 2, so E = 20 + 2, which simplifies to E = 22.

Therefore, Jean is 22 years old.

"To find the total time taken by the well-rounded team, we can multiply the time taken by each member by 4 since there are 4 members in the team.

Time taken by the well-rounded team = 55 * 4 = 220 seconds

Now, let's find the time taken by the less well-rounded team. The first runner takes 60 seconds. The subsequent runners are 3 seconds faster than the previous runner. 

Time taken by the second runner = 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
Time taken by the third runner = 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
Time taken by the fourth runner = 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

Total time taken by the less well-rounded team = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds

The difference in time between the two teams = 222 - 220 = 2 seconds

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of two events: rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is 3/6, since there are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. 

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2), since the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 1/2, and the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 1/2.

Now, we can calculate the probability of the complementary event (rolling a number less than or equal to 3) on the first roll, which is 3/6.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

The probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 3 on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on the second roll, given that the first roll was less than or equal to 3, is 3/6 = 1/2.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on the second roll, given that the first roll was greater than 3, is 3/6 = 1/2.

Using the law of total probability, we can calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on the second roll as:

P(rolling a number greater than 3 on the second roll) = P(rolling a number greater than 3 on the first roll) * P(rolling a number greater than 3 on the second roll | rolling a number greater than 3 on the first roll) + P(rolling a number less than or equal to 3 on the first roll) * P(rolling a number greater than 3 on the second roll | rolling a number less than or equal to 3 on the first roll)
= (1/2) * (1/2) + (1/2) * (1/2)
= 1/2 + 1/2
= 1

Now, we can calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on the first roll as:

P(rolling a number greater than 3 on the first roll) = P(rolling a number greater than 3 on the second roll) - P(rolling a number greater than 3 on the second roll | rolling a number greater than 3 on the first roll) * P(rolling a number greater than 3 on the first roll)
= 1 - (1/2) * (1/2)
= 1 - 1/4
= 3/4

Now, we can calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row as:

P(rolling two even numbers in a row) = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4

Now, we can calculate the difference in probability:

P(rolling a number greater than 3) - P(rolling two even numbers in a row) = 3/4 - 1/4 = 2/4 = 1/2

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

(1/2) * 100 = 50%

Therefore, Jerry is 50% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row."
"To find the total number of apples picked, we need to first determine how many apples Jenna picked. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom picked 20 apples, we can calculate Jenna's share as follows:

Jenna's apples = Mom's apples / 2
Jenna's apples = 20 / 2
Jenna's apples = 10

Now, to find the total number of apples picked, we add Jenna's apples to her mom's apples:

Total apples = Jenna's apples + Mom's apples
Total apples = 10 + 20
Total apples = 30

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of straw pieces used among the hamsters and rabbits. 

The hamsters have 10 cages, each with 5 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw pieces used among the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

The rabbits have 20 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw pieces used among the rabbits is 20.

The total number of straw pieces used among the hamsters and rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70.

Since the total number of straw pieces distributed among the small rodents is 160, the number of straw pieces used among the rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'x'. Then, the total number of straw pieces used among the rats is 6x.

Since the total number of straw pieces used among the rats is 90, we can set up the equation 6x = 90.

To solve for 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 6, which gives us x = 90 / 6 = 15.

Therefore, there are 15 rats in each cage."
"To calculate the amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest first. 

The formula for simple interest is: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

In this case, Principal = $100, Rate = 2% or 0.02, and Time = 3 months.

Interest = $100 * 0.02 * 3
Interest = $6

Now, we add the interest to the principal to find the total amount Mandy should pay: 
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $100 + $6
Total Amount = $106

The final answer is: $106"
"To find the total cost of the bags, we need to subtract the profit from the total revenue. 

Total revenue = Number of bags * Selling price per bag
Total revenue = Number of bags * $30
Total revenue = $400
Number of bags = $400 / $30
Number of bags = 13.33

Since we can't sell a fraction of a bag, we'll round down to 13 bags.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the bags, including transportation:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 13 * $20
Total cost = $260

Now, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the total transportation cost:
Total transportation cost = Total revenue - Total cost
Total transportation cost = $400 - $260
Total transportation cost = $140

Since the cost to transport each bag is $2, we can find the number of bags transported:
Number of bags transported = Total transportation cost / Cost per bag
Number of bags transported = $140 / $2
Number of bags transported = 70

However, this is not the total number of bags the trader bought. We know the trader bought 13 bags initially. The difference between the number of bags transported and the number of bags bought is the number of bags that were not transported:
Number of bags not transported = Number of bags transported - Number of bags bought
Number of bags not transported = 70 - 13
Number of bags not transported = 57

Since the bags not transported were not sold, we can find the total number of bags sold by adding the number of bags bought and the number of bags not transported:
Total number of bags sold = Number of bags bought + Number of bags not transported
Total number of bags sold = 13 + 57
Total number of bags sold = 70

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how much they spent on food, we need to subtract $4.50 from the total cost of the tickets. 

Total cost of tickets = $20.25
Cost of food = Total cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50
Cost of food = $15.75

Total cost of tickets and food = $20.25 + $15.75
Total cost of tickets and food = $36.00

They went on 2 rides, and each ride costs $33. Total cost of rides = 2 * $33 = $66.

Total cost of all expenses = Total cost of tickets and food + Total cost of rides
Total cost of all expenses = $36.00 + $66
Total cost of all expenses = $102

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we need to divide the total cost by 3.

Cost per person = Total cost of all expenses / 3
Cost per person = $102 / 3
Cost per person = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total number of peaches John collects, we need to multiply the number of peaches he can collect per minute by the number of minutes he collects.

Number of peaches collected per minute = 2
Number of minutes = 3

Total peaches collected = Number of peaches collected per minute * Number of minutes
= 2 * 3
= 6

The total number of peaches John collects is 6."
"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we need to divide the total weekly amount by 7 days.

Weekly amount of insects needed = 3.5 pounds
Number of days in a week = 7

Daily amount of insects needed = Weekly amount / Number of days
= 3.5 / 7
= 0.5 pounds

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks need 0.5 pounds of insects per day to survive."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of trees Tom has after 10 years.

Initially, Tom has 50 trees.

Tom plants 10 trees a year, so after 10 years, he will have planted 10 * 10 = 100 new trees.

However, he also chops down 2 trees a year, so he will have chopped down 2 * 10 = 20 trees.

The total number of trees he has after 10 years is the sum of the initial trees, the trees he planted, and the trees he chopped down: 50 + 100 - 20 = 130.

Now, 30% of the trees die. To find 30% of 130, we multiply 130 by 0.3: 130 * 0.3 = 39.

So, 39 trees die, leaving Tom with 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

The final answer is 91."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pink and white flamingos at noon on Sunday.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. So, the remaining number of pink flamingos is 18 - 6 = 12.

Then, they painted 6 flamingos white and put them back out. Now, there are 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

On Sunday, they added 18 more pink flamingos. So, the total number of pink flamingos is 12 + 18 = 30.

The number of white flamingos remains the same, which is 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how much change Violetta will get, we need to first calculate the total cost of the crayons. Since she needs 5 crayons and each crayon costs $2, the total cost will be 5 * $2 = $10.

Since Violetta has $20, we subtract the total cost from the amount she has: $20 - $10 = $10.

So, Violetta will get $10 as change."
"To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser. 

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8.

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of one pen * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $12.00"
"To find the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used, we need to subtract the total amount of carrots distributed from the total amount available.

Total amount of carrots available = 200 pounds
Number of restaurants = 40
Carrots per restaurant = 2 pounds

Total amount of carrots distributed = Number of restaurants * Carrots per restaurant
Total amount of carrots distributed = 40 * 2
Total amount of carrots distributed = 80 pounds

Now, subtract the total amount distributed from the total amount available:
Carrots not used = Total amount available - Total amount distributed
Carrots not used = 200 - 80
Carrots not used = 120 pounds

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times that number, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards. So, now she has 20 + 60 = 80 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards. So, now she has 80 + 40 = 120 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokémon cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number is 60 + 40 = 100. Twice that number is 2 * 100 = 200 cards. So, now she has 120 + 200 = 320 cards.

Therefore, Elaine now has 320 Pokémon cards.

"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to first determine how many sentences he edits for each publisher. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we can divide the total number of sentences by 2.

1000 sentences / 2 = 500 sentences per publisher

Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, we can calculate the amount Mark earns from Publisher A:

500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, we can calculate the amount Mark earns from Publisher B:

500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

Now, we can add the amounts Mark earns from both publishers to find his total weekly earnings:

2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

"To find the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the total number of pails he gets and then multiply it by the amount of water in each pail.

Baldur gets 5 pails of water in the morning and 6 pails of water in the afternoon. So, the total number of pails he gets in a day is 5 + 6 = 11 pails.

Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, the total amount of water he gets in a day is 11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters.

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider the monetary reward and the raise in salary.

The monetary reward is a one-time payment of $5000.

The raise in salary is 5% of his weekly salary, which is $2000. 

5% of $2000 is 0.05 * $2000 = $100.

So, his new weekly salary after the raise is $2000 + $100 = $2100.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, his total earnings for the year would be:

$2100 * 52 = $109,800

Additionally, he received the $5000 monetary reward, so his total earnings for the year would be:

$109,800 + $5000 = $110,800

"To find the total number of barrels of wine produced, we need to calculate the total number of tons of grapes produced and then multiply it by the number of barrels produced per ton.

First, we calculate the total number of tons of grapes produced per year:
10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons

Next, we multiply the total number of tons by the number of barrels produced per ton:
50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

Therefore, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal and add them together.

Carl ate a sandwich for lunch every day, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he used 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. So, for 3 days, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

Carl also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese, using 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add up the slices of cheese Carl used: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices of cheese.

The total number of slices of cheese Carl used is 31."

"To find the required score, we first need to find the total score Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93. 

Since there are 6 tests, the total score required for an average of 93 is 93 * 6 = 558.

We know Brinley's scores for the first five tests: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. 

The sum of these scores is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 358.

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score among the given scores. The lowest score is 71.

To find the total score Brinley needs, we subtract the lowest score from the required total score: 558 - 71 = 487.

Now, we subtract the sum of the remaining scores from the total score Brinley needs: 487 - 358 = 129.

This is the score Brinley needs on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately and then add them together.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, so each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples together to get the total weight of the bag of candy: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that twenty dozen cups is equal to 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

We are also given that half a dozen plates cost $6000. Since a dozen is 12, half a dozen is 6. So, the cost of 6 plates is $6000.

Now, we are told that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. Let's denote the cost of 20 dozen cups as x. We can set up the equation:

x = 6000 - 1200
x = 4800

Since x represents the cost of 20 dozen cups, we need to find the cost of 1 dozen cups. To do this, we divide x by 12:

Cost of 1 dozen cups = x / 12
= 4800 / 12
= 400

So, the cost of 1 dozen cups is $400.

To find the cost of 1 cup, we divide the cost of 1 dozen cups by 12:

Cost of 1 cup = 400 / 12
= 33.33

Therefore, the total cost of buying each cup is $33.33.

The final answer is: $33.33"
"To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn to buy the jacket and shoes. 

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20, so the total cost is $30 + $20 = $50.

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs to earn $50 - $10 = $40 more.

She earns $5 per babysitting session and $4 per lawn mowing session. To find out how many babysitting sessions she needs to earn $40, we divide $40 by $5, which is 8 sessions.

However, we are asked to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn. Since she earns $4 per lawn mowing session, we can divide $40 by $4 to find out how many sessions she needs to mow the lawn, which is 10 sessions.

Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that w = r + 2.

The total number of eggs collected per day is 42, and the total number of eggs produced per day is 3r + 5w. Since w = r + 2, we can substitute w in the equation:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

"To find the total time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park, as he is walking around its edge. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the dimensions of the park (1.5 miles by 6 miles), we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(1.5 + 6)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at 3 miles/hour, we can divide the perimeter by his speed to find the time spent walking:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find the number of customers on the first day. 

Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. 

On the second day, Sloane counted 50 more customers than the first day, so the number of customers on the second day is x + 50.

The total number of customers by the third day is 500, which is the sum of the customers on the first day, the second day, and the third day. 

We can write the equation as: x + (x + 50) + (x + 50 + y) = 500, where y is the number of customers on the third day.

However, we are given that the total number of customers by the third day is 500, so we can simplify the equation to: 3x + 100 = 500.

Now, we can solve for x: 3x = 400, x = 400/3, x = 133.33.

However, since the number of customers must be a whole number, we can round down to 133 customers on the first day.

Now, we can find the number of customers on the second day: 133 + 50 = 183.

The number of customers on the third day is 500 - (133 + 183) = 184.

The final answer is: 184"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool was 2x gallons.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the total amount of water lost from both pools in 4 minutes is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as y gallons. This means the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y gallons.

Since the big pool initially had 2x gallons and lost 16 gallons, the current amount of water in the big pool is 2x - 16. We know this is equal to 4y, so we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4y

We also know that the small pool initially had x gallons and lost 16 gallons, so the current amount of water in the small pool is x - 16. We are told that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool, so we can set up another equation:

4y = x - 16

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x and y.

From the second equation, we can express x as x = 4y + 16.

Substituting this expression for x into the first equation, we get:

2(4y + 16) - 16 = 4y

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

8y + 32 - 16 = 4y

Combine like terms:

8y + 16 = 4y

Subtract 4y from both sides:

4y + 16 = 0

Subtract 16 from both sides:

4y = -16

Divide both sides by 4:

y = -4

Since the amount of water cannot be negative, this solution is not valid. However, we can re-examine our steps.

Let's re-evaluate the equations. We can start by setting up the correct equation for the amount of water in the small pool:

x - 16 = y

We also know that the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, so we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4y

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x and y.

From the first equation, we can express x as x = y + 16.

Substituting this expression for x into the second equation, we get:

2(y + 16) - 16 = 4y

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

2y + 32 - 16 = 4y

Combine like terms:

2y + 16 = 4y

Subtract 2y from both sides:

16 = 2y

Divide both sides by 2:

8 = y

Now that we have the value of y, we can find the value of x:

x = y + 16
x = 8 + 16
x = 24

Now that we have the initial amount of water in the small pool, we can find the current amount of water in the small pool:

y = 8

The final answer is: 8"

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

Therefore, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we need to calculate the total amount she will pay and subtract it from the initial amount borrowed.

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. This means she will return $2000 + 10% of $2000, which is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Since she is going to pay $165 a month for 12 months, the total amount she will pay is $165 * 12 = $1980.

Now, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned: $2200 - $1980 = $220.

So, Janeth's remaining balance will be $220.

"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to add the number of roses and dahlias. 

We know there are 4 roses. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias by adding 7 to the number of roses: 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias.

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of roses and dahlias: 4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15 flowers.

"To find the current ages of Adrian and Zack, we need to use the given information. 

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, we can find Zack's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 2. 

Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 * 21
Zack's age = 42

Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, we can find Adrian's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 3.

Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 * 21
Adrian's age = 63

Now, we need to find their ages in three years. 

Adrian's age in 3 years = Adrian's current age + 3
Adrian's age in 3 years = 63 + 3
Adrian's age in 3 years = 66

Zack's age in 3 years = Zack's current age + 3
Zack's age in 3 years = 42 + 3
Zack's age in 3 years = 45

Harriet's age in 3 years = Harriet's current age + 3
Harriet's age in 3 years = 21 + 3
Harriet's age in 3 years = 24

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3.

Average age = (Adrian's age in 3 years + Zack's age in 3 years + Harriet's age in 3 years) / 3
Average age = (66 + 45 + 24) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45"
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points the other three students scored. 

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know that the total points scored by the four students is 251. We can subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total to find out how many points Jojo scored. 

251 - 68 - 44 - 85 = 54

Jojo scored 54 points."

"To find the amount of water left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters, we need to subtract 90 from the initial amount of 120 liters.

120 - 90 = 30 liters

Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left, which is 30 liters. So, the amount of rainwater collected is 2 * 30 = 60 liters.

Now, we need to add the amount of rainwater to the remaining water in the tank.

30 + 60 = 90 liters

The tank now contains 90 liters of water."
"To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to add the number of geraniums and petunias. 

First, we find the number of petunias: 
Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
= 90 - 40
= 50

Now, we add the number of geraniums and petunias:
Total flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
= 90 + 50

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 48%.

The final answer is 48."
"To find the total cost of Chad's meal, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The base burrito costs $6.50.
Adding extra meat for $2.00, the total is $6.50 + $2.00 = $8.50.
Adding extra cheese for $1.00, the total is $8.50 + $1.00 = $9.50.
Adding avocado for $1.00, the total is $9.50 + $1.00 = $10.50.
Adding 2 sauces for $0.25 each, the total is $10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00.
The upgrade for $3.00 adds to the total, making it $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.
Finally, subtracting the gift card for $5.00, the total is $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

Chad still owes $9.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can place per minute. 

Since Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute, her mom can add half of that, which is 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

Together, they can add 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the 360-piece puzzle. 

To do this, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can add per minute: 360 / 6 = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 60 / 60 = 1 hour.

Therefore, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

The final answer is: 1"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, there were 120 baby watermelons. 30% of them were ready for harvest, so the number of watermelons ready for harvest is 30% of 120, which is 0.3 * 120 = 36.

The remaining watermelons are 120 - 36 = 84.

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready for harvest. To find the number of watermelons ready for harvest, we multiply the remaining melons by 3/4, which is 84 * 3/4 = 63.

The number of watermelons not ready for harvest after the two weeks is 84 - 63 = 21.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees.

The cost of the cars is 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.

The tax on the cars is 10% of $240,000, which is 0.1 * $240,000 = $24,000.

The registration fees for the cars are $1000 * 12 = $12,000.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

"To find the total number of insects in the garden, we need to first find the number of bugs. Since there are half as many bugs as ants, we can calculate the number of bugs by dividing the number of ants by 2.

Number of ants = 50
Number of bugs = 50 / 2 = 25

Now, we need to add the number of bugs and ants to find the total number of insects in the garden.

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs

= 75

The total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To find the number of penguins left sunbathing, we first need to determine how many penguins are involved in the activities that are not sunbathing. 

One-third of the penguins (36 / 3 = 12) jump in the ocean, and another one-third (36 / 3 = 12) go inside the cave to eat their dinner. 

So, the total number of penguins involved in these activities is 12 + 12 = 24. 

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of penguins (36) to find the number of penguins left sunbathing: 36 - 24 = 12.

Therefore, 12 penguins are still left sunbathing."
"To determine the number of vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate the total number of tomatoes he eats per week. Since Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day and there are 7 days in a week, he eats 6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes per week.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half of what he eats, which is 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes per week.

The total number of tomatoes they eat per week is 42 (Steve) + 21 (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes per week.

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed is 63 / 3 = 21 vines.

21"
"To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we need to divide the total number of slices required by the number of slices per pizza. 

Since each pizza is cut into 8 portions, and John wants each of his 20 friends to have 4 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices required as follows:

Total slices required = Number of friends * Slices per friend
Total slices required = 20 * 4
Total slices required = 80

Since each pizza has 8 slices, we can divide the total number of slices required by 8 to find the number of pizzas needed:

Number of pizzas = Total slices required / Slices per pizza
Number of pizzas = 80 / 8
Number of pizzas = 10

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand that Ram is essentially diluting the ink from the 25 pens to make new pens. Since he can make one full pen from the ink of five empty pens, we can calculate the total number of new pens he can make.

Let's assume the initial 25 pens have a certain amount of ink. When Ram makes a new pen, he uses 1/5 of the ink from the original 25 pens. 

So, the amount of ink used to make one new pen is 1/5 of 25, which is 5. 

Now, we need to find out how many new pens Ram can make with the remaining ink. Since he uses 5 ink to make one new pen, we can divide the total amount of ink (25) by 5 to find the number of new pens he can make.

25 / 5 = 5

So, Ram can make 5 new pens with the ink from the 25 pens. 

Initially, Ram had 25 pens. After making 5 new pens, he will have a total of 25 + 5 = 30 pens.

The final answer is 30."

"To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we need to determine the ages of Mary and Joan first.

Since Jessa is 20 years old, and Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, Joan's age is 20 + 5 = 25 years.

Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, so Mary's age is 25 - 2 = 23 years.

Now, we can find the sum of their ages: 20 (Jessa) + 25 (Joan) + 23 (Mary) = 68 years.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many candies Robert has. 

Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies, we can set up the equation: 
2x = 54, where x is the number of candies Robert has.

Solving for x, we get x = 54 / 2 = 27.

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find out how many candies James has. Since James has 6 more candies than Robert, James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has: 54 - 33 = 21.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the total number of books each person has and the number of books they read.

Dolly has 2 books.
Pandora has 1 book.

Since they read each other's books as well as their own, we can calculate the total number of books they read as follows:

- Dolly reads her own 2 books and Pandora's 1 book, for a total of 2 + 1 = 3 books.
- Pandora reads her own 1 book and Dolly's 2 books, for a total of 1 + 2 = 3 books.

Now, we add the total number of books they read: 3 (Dolly's books) + 3 (Pandora's books) = 6 books.

Therefore, Dolly and Pandora collectively read 6 books.

"To find the total number of letters Mike writes per week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he receives and sends.

He receives 2 letters per week from each of the 3 remaining penpals, so he receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters per week.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters per week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so he writes 6 * 5 = 30 pages per week.

Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, he spends 30 * 6 = 180 minutes per week writing.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

Additionally, Jason has had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. 

So, the total minutes used is 450 + 300 = 750 minutes.

Since Jason's phone plan is 1000 minutes per month, the minutes left is 1000 - 750 = 250 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 fries, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, but we don't know how many yet. Let's call the number of fries Ginger gave 'x'. After Ginger gave her fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now, Griffin has 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We are given that Griffin ended up with 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27.

Solving for x, we get x = 20.

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Since x represents the number of fish in each aquarium, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is 14."

Sue's cookies on Monday = 4 * 5 = 20 cookies

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so we multiply her sister's cookies on Tuesday by 2.

Sue's cookies on Tuesday = 2 * 13 = 26 cookies

Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 + 26 = 46 cookies

Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies

Now, we can find the difference in calories by multiplying the total cookies eaten by each person by 200.

Total calories eaten by Sue = 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
Total calories eaten by her sister = 18 * 200 = 3600 calories

Since the school is 50% girls, and there are 3 classes, the total number of girls is 50% of 3 classes, which is 1.5 classes. 

Since each class has 20 students, the total number of girls is 1.5 * 20 = 30 girls.

We already know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in these two classes is 15 + 12 = 27 girls.

This means that the third class has 30 - 27 = 3 girls.

"To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we first need to determine the total number of cows in the 20 stalls after Mr. Sylas buys and distributes the new cows.

Initially, there were 20 cows in each stall, so the total number of cows in 20 stalls is 20 * 20 = 400 cows.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. This means each stall will receive 40 / 20 = 2 cows.

Now, the total number of cows in the 20 stalls is 400 (initial cows) + 40 (new cows) = 440 cows.

To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in each stall (2) by 8: 2 * 8 = 16 cows.

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the weight of the wood that the termites ate and subtract it from the total weight of the redwood.

First, we need to find the total weight of the redwood. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can divide the total height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 to find the number of sections:

200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections

Now, we can multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section to find the total weight of the redwood:

20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds

Next, we need to find the weight of the wood that the termites ate. Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, we can multiply the total weight of the redwood by 0.30 (which is equivalent to 30%):

8000 pounds * 0.30 = 2400 pounds

Now, we can subtract the weight of the wood that the termites ate from the total weight of the redwood to find the weight of the remaining wood:

8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

Therefore, the redwood weighs 5600 pounds.

52 = x + 8
x = 44

Jamal has 44 apples.

Since Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, Jamal has:
Jamal's bananas = 44 + 4 = 48

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal:
Andrea's bananas = 48 / 2 = 24

Now, we can find the total number of fruits:

"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we need to calculate the amount of flour required for each day separately and then add them together.

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen (12) cookies, we can calculate the amount of flour needed for 36 cookies as follows:

36 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 3 dozen
3 dozen = 3 * 2 cups = 6 cups

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. We can calculate the amount of flour needed for 30 cookies as follows:

30 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 2.5 dozen
2.5 dozen = 2.5 * 2 cups = 5 cups

Now, we add the amount of flour needed for both days:

6 cups (today) + 5 cups (tomorrow) = 11 cups

Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to first find the number of pennies in two thirds of the cup.

Two thirds of 9,300 pennies is (2/3) * 9,300 = 6,200 pennies.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, the total dollar amount in the stack is 6,200 * $0.01 = $62.

The final answer is 62."
"To find the total number of marbles Maddison has now, we need to add the marbles she initially had to the marbles she received from her friend.

Maddison initially had 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each box, so she had 5 * 50 = 250 marbles.

Then, she received 20 marbles from her friend. 

Now, she has 250 + 20 = 270 marbles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the number of trees in each yard, we need to follow the given information:

1. Chris has 6 trees.
2. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, so Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.
3. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has, so Harry has 2 * 3 + 5 = 11 trees.

To find the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard:

11 (Harry's trees) - 3 (Ferdinand's trees) = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total amount of money the girls have combined, we need to add up the amounts each one has.

Carmen has $100.
Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.
Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, let's add up the amounts: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

The final answer is: $400"
"To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

Brokerage fee: 5% of $350,000 = 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500
Transfer fee: 12% of $350,000 = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000

Total additional fees: $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500

Now, we add the total fees to the selling price to get the total price of the house:
$350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500

Since Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000, the difference between the total price of the house and her budget is:
$409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500"
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid and subtract it from the selling price.

Transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000
Brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000
Total amount paid: $12,000 (transfer fees) + $20,000 (brokerage fee) + $250,000 (loan amount) = $282,000

Net proceeds: $400,000 (selling price) - $282,000 (total amount paid) = $118,000

The final answer is: $118,000"
"To find the total time, we need to break it down into three parts: heating the oil, heating the oil to the desired temperature, and cooking the chicken.

1. Heating the oil: 20 minutes
2. Heating the oil to the desired temperature: 20 minutes * 1.4 (40% longer) = 28 minutes
3. Cooking the chicken: 28 minutes - 5 minutes = 23 minutes

The real estate agent spent $1375 on buying all the ads."
"To find the number of blue golf balls, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know the juggler can juggle 16 balls in total. Since half of the balls are golf balls, we can find the number of golf balls by dividing the total number of balls by 2.

Number of golf balls = Total number of balls / 2
= 16 / 2
= 8

Now, we know that half of the golf balls are blue. To find the number of blue golf balls, we can divide the number of golf balls by 2.

Number of blue golf balls = Number of golf balls / 2
= 8 / 2
= 4

Therefore, there are 4 blue golf balls."
"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then add them together.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

The total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To find the total number of windows in the bedrooms, we multiply the number of bedrooms by the number of windows per bedroom: 3 bedrooms * 2 windows/bedroom = 6 windows per house. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 6 windows/house * 2 houses = 12 windows.

Now, let's add the additional windows not connected to bedrooms: 4 windows/house * 2 houses = 8 windows. 

The total number of windows in both houses is 12 windows (bedrooms) + 8 windows (additional) = 20 windows.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost of the items purchased, we need to add the cost of cocoa, laundry, and pasta.

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $14.99

Since the mother paid $20, we can find the change by subtracting the total cost from the amount paid.

Change = $20 - $14.99 = $5.01

The cashier gives the mother $5.01 in change."
"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we need to first calculate the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is 900 stitches. 
So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know that the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We also know that the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes 90 stitches, and the rosette takes 180 stitches. 

To find the number of stitches for the two sleeves, we subtract the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette from the total number of stitches for the sweater.
1800 - (900 + 90 + 180) = 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2.
630 / 2 = 315 stitches per sleeve.

The final answer is 315."
"To find the total cost of the seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the cost of the celery seeds separately and then add them together.

The cost of the tomato seeds is 20 packets * $40/packet = $800.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's denote the number of lines in the first scene as x. Since the first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song, we can write an equation: x = 2 * 54 = 108.

Now, we know that only a third of the lines in the first scene are Sean's lines. So, the number of lines Sean has to memorize in the first scene is x / 3 = 108 / 3 = 36.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so the number of lines in the second scene is 54 + 6 = 60.

Four-fifths of the lines in the second scene are Sean's lines, so the number of lines Sean has to memorize in the second scene is 60 * (4/5) = 48.

Now, let's add up the total number of lines Sean has to memorize: 36 (from the first scene) + 48 (from the second scene) + 54 (from the song) = 138.

The final answer is: 138"

"To find the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

Time for small holes: 30 holes * 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes
Time for large holes: 15 holes * 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes

Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

"To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to first find their current ages. 

Let's denote Mico's current age as M and Marco's current age as C. We know that M + C = 20.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be M + 10 and Marco's age will be C + 10. 

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (M + 10) + (C + 10) = M + C + 20.

Since M + C = 20, we can substitute this into the equation: 
M + C + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40.

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40."
"Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S. 

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can express this as R = 6S.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can express this as R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Substituting R = 6S into the equation, we get 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Expanding the equation, we get 6S + 9 = 3S + 27.

Subtracting 3S from both sides, we get 3S + 9 = 27.

Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get 3S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get S = 6.

Therefore, Sam is 6 years old now.

"To find the total number of spots, we first need to find the number of spots on each type of snake. 

Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas, so the total number of spots is (40 * 70) + (60 * 35) = 2800 + 2100 = 4900.

Half the number of spots is 4900 / 2 = 2450.

"To determine the total number of people attending the soccer game, we need to calculate the number of team members and their guests. 

There are 12 team members, and each team member brings 2 guests. So, the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. 

Adding the team members and their guests, we get 12 + 24 = 36 people.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we need 36 / 3 = 12 pizzas.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost will be 12 * 15 = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we need to first find the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones. Since there are 8 gemstones, each 1 inch long, the total length occupied by the gemstones is 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and the gemstones occupy 8 inches, so the remaining space is used by the sterling silver beads. 

To find the length occupied by the silver beads, subtract the length occupied by the gemstones from the total length: 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Since each silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, we can find the number of beads by dividing the length occupied by the silver beads by the length of each bead: 17 / 0.25 = 68.

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace."
"To find the total number of stories written, we need to calculate the number of stories each child wrote in the second week and then add them up.

In the second week, Alani doubled her stories from the first week, so she wrote 2 * 20 = 40 stories. 
Braylen doubled his stories from the first week, so he wrote 2 * 40 = 80 stories. 
Margot doubled her stories from the first week, so she wrote 2 * 60 = 120 stories.

Now, we add up the total number of stories written by each child in the second week:

"To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has and subtract the cost of the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, the total value of the quarters is 5 * 25 = 125 cents.

She also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, the total value of the dimes is 2 * 10 = 20 cents.

The total amount of money Kelly has is 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

The can of pop costs 55 cents. To find out how many cents she will have left, we subtract the cost of the pop from the total amount of money she has: 145 - 55 = 90 cents.

The flag has 3 rows of 8 stars, which is 3 * 8 = 24 stars. 
It has 2 rows of 6 stars, which is 2 * 6 = 12 stars. 
The remaining stars are 76 - (24 + 12) = 40 stars. 

Since each row has 5 stars, we divide 40 by 5 to find the number of 5-star rows: 40 / 5 = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. 

Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of medals Ali has as A and the number of medals Izzy has as I. We know that Ali has 22 medals, so A = 22.

We also know that Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so I = A - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17.

The total number of medals they have together is A + I = 22 + 17 = 39.

The problem states that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. Let's denote the total number of medals given out as T. This can be represented as:

A + I = 10T

Substituting the values we know, we get:

22 + 17 = 10T
39 = 10T

To find T, we divide both sides by 10:

T = 39 / 10
T = 3.9

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 3.9.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find the total number of chocolate bars available. 

There are 4 adults and 8 children, so the total number of people is 4 + 8 = 12. 

Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets, so the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

The remaining chocolate bars are 40 - 24 = 16.

Since the remaining chocolate bars are to be shared equally among the children, we divide 16 by 8 (the number of children) to find out how many each child will get. 

16 / 8 = 2.

Therefore, each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total number of 10-minute intervals she works. 

First, let's calculate the total minutes she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. 

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total minutes she works.

180 minutes - 30 minutes = 150 minutes

Now, we can divide the total minutes she works by 10 to find out how many 10-minute intervals she works.

150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we can multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval.

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

The final answer is $75."
"To find the initial points of each player, we can start by using the information given:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

Now, let's calculate the points after the fourth round. Since all players have over 20 points, they will each get an extra point.

- Mike's new points: 21 + 1 = 22
- Jim's new points: 18 + 1 = 19
- Tony's new points: 42 + 1 = 43

Now, let's add up the points of all three players to find the total points after the extra points had been distributed.

Total points = Mike's points + Jim's points + Tony's points
Total points = 22 + 19 + 43
Total points = 84

The total count of activities Darren has done in the two days is 220 + 90 + 60 = 370."
"To determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day. So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

To find out how many days the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the daily consumption: 42 kg / 2 kg = 21 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of days by 7 to find out how many weeks the rice will last: 21 days / 7 days/week = 3 weeks.

The 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To find out how many crates Sam sold in total, we need to add the number of crates he sold on each day.

"To calculate the total cost of driving, we need to calculate the total miles driven per year and the total miles driven per day.

Total miles driven per year = 2 * 30 miles * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 30,000 miles/year

Total miles driven per day = 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles/day

Total miles driven per month = 60 miles/day * 30 days/month = 1800 miles/month

Total miles driven per year = 1800 miles/month * 12 months/year = 21,600 miles/year

Now, let's calculate the total cost of driving:

Total miles driven per year * cost per mile = 21,600 miles/year * $2/mile = $43,200/year

Additionally, John gets a $150 bonus per month, so the total bonus per year is:

$150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800/year

Total cost of driving per year = $43,200/year + $1,800/year = $45,000/year

The final answer is: $45,000"

Since Peter wants to exercise twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we multiply the total time by 2.

Time needed on Tuesday = 2 * 39 = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."

When folding the paper, we have two sides: the left side and the right side. 

- The left side has 16 pages (pages 1-16).
- The right side has 16 pages (pages 17-32).

Since each side has 16 pages, and we need to print on both sides, we need 2 pieces of paper for each side. 

Therefore, the total number of pieces of paper needed is 2 (for the left side) + 2 (for the right side) = 4.

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to first determine the number of books she sold in the second year. 

We know that she sold 45 books this year, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. 

Let's denote the number of books sold in the first year as x. Then, the number of books sold in the second year is 2x. 

Since the total number of books is 250, and there are 50 unsold books, the total number of books sold in the first two years is 250 - 50 = 200. 

We can set up the equation: x + 2x = 200. 

Solving for x, we get 3x = 200, x = 200/3, x = 66.67. 

Since we can't sell a fraction of a book, we'll round down to 66 books sold in the first year. 

The number of books sold in the second year is 2x = 2 * 66 = 132. 

The total amount of money earned in the first year is 66 * 20 = 1320. 

The total amount of money earned in the second year is 132 * 20 = 2640. 

The total amount of money earned in the first two years is 1320 + 2640 = 3960."
"To calculate Watson's total earnings for April, we need to calculate his regular earnings and the bonus.

Watson works 10 hours a day, 5 days a week, so he works 10 * 5 = 50 hours per week. Since April has 30 days, he works a total of 50 * 4 = 200 hours in April.

His regular earnings for April are 200 hours * $10/hour = $2000.

Since the company performed well for the whole month, Watson gets a $300 bonus. So, his total earnings for April are $2000 + $300 = $2300.

"To find the number of people John lost to, we need to calculate 20% of 20, since John beats 80% of the people he arm wrestled.

20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4

So, John lost to 4 people."
"To find the number of loaves sold in the afternoon, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning: 
   Two-thirds of 60 loaves = (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves

2. Calculate the number of loaves left after the morning sales:
   Total loaves - loaves sold in the morning = 60 - 40 = 20 loaves

3. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon:
   Half of the remaining loaves = (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves

The bakery sells 10 loaves of bread in the afternoon."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much weight Joey loses per week. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks to find the weight lost per week.

Weight lost per week = Total weight lost / Number of weeks
Weight lost per week = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weight lost per week = 2 pounds

Since Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and she loses 2 pounds per week, it will take her the same number of weeks it takes Joey to lose 8 pounds.

Therefore, Sandy will also take 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the cost of 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk at the original price and then subtract it from the total cost at the discounted price.

Original cost of 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 * $13 = $26
Original cost of 4 packets of milk: 4 * $0.5 = $2
Total original cost: $26 + $2 = $28

Discounted cost of 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 * $11 = $22
Discounted cost of 4 packets of milk: 4 * $0.5 = $2
Total discounted cost: $22 + $2 = $24

Savings: $28 - $24 = $4

The final answer is: $4"
"To determine the total number of new limbs, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs the person will grow in the first 15 days.

In the first 3 days, the person will grow 1 extra arm.
In the next 3 days (4-6 days), the person will grow 1 extra leg.
In the next 3 days (7-9 days), the person will grow 1 extra arm.
In the next 3 days (10-12 days), the person will grow 1 extra leg.
In the next 3 days (13-15 days), the person will grow 1 extra arm.

Since the person grows an extra arm every 3 days and an extra leg every 5 days, we can observe a pattern. In 15 days, the person will grow 5 extra arms (1 in the first 3 days, 1 in the next 3 days, 1 in the next 3 days, 1 in the next 3 days, and 1 in the last 3 days) and 3 extra legs (1 in the 4-6 days, 1 in the 10-12 days, and 1 in the 13-15 days).

Therefore, the total number of new limbs the person will grow is 5 extra arms + 3 extra legs = 8 new limbs.

"To find out how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to calculate the total cost of his trip and subtract the amount he wants to save.

First, let's calculate the cost of the suits: 6 suits * $100 each = $600.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases * $50 each = $150.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. So, the cost of the flight ticket is 5 * $100 + $700 = $700 + $500 = $1200.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the trip: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

Since Theo wants to save $2000, he will spend $6000 - $2000 = $4000.

Therefore, Theo has to spend $4000 on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

"To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to calculate the number of eggs consumed by the three people who eat three eggs each day and the number of eggs consumed by the two people who eat two eggs each day.

Three people eat three eggs each day, so they consume 3 * 3 = 9 eggs per day.
Two people eat two eggs each day, so they consume 2 * 2 = 4 eggs per day.

The total number of eggs consumed per day is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of eggs consumed in a week is 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

"To find Trent's age, we need to work backwards from Quinn's age. 

Quinn is 30 years old. 
Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so Jane is 30 - 3 = 27 years old. 
Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so Trent is 27 + 5 = 32 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote Noah's current age as N and Cera's current age as C. We are given that Cera is currently 46 years old, so C = 46.

We are also given that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. This means that six years ago, Noah's age was N - 6, and Cera's age was C - 6. Since Noah was half as old as Cera, we can set up the equation:

N - 6 = (1/2)(C - 6)

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Let's denote the population of Chile six years ago as P. We can set up the equation:

P = 3000(N - 6)

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. This means that P = (1/2)P_now, where P_now is the current population of Chile. We can set up the equation:

P = (1/2)P_now

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. We can substitute the expression for P from the second equation into the first equation:

3000(N - 6) = (1/2)P_now

We can also substitute the expression for P from the second equation into the first equation:

3000(N - 6) = (1/2)(2P_now)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3000(N - 6) = P_now

Now we can substitute C = 46 into the equation N - 6 = (1/2)(C - 6):

N - 6 = (1/2)(46 - 6)
N - 6 = (1/2)(40)
N - 6 = 20
N = 26

Now that we have found N, we can substitute it into the equation 3000(N - 6) = P_now:

3000(26 - 6) = P_now
3000(20) = P_now
60000 = P_now

Therefore, the population of Chile now is 60000.

60000"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as D. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is D/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

D + 2D + D/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2D + 4D + D = 210

Combine like terms:

7D = 210

Divide both sides by 7:

D = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

"To find the total number of people invited, we need to calculate the number of people in each group and add them together. 

There are 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 x 6 = 12 people. 
There are 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 x 4 = 12 people. 
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people. 
We subtract these 2 people from the total number of people who were supposed to come: 16 - 2 = 14.

Therefore, 14 people show up for Martha's party."
"To find the total weight of marbles, we first need to calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has. 

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 

2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. 

So, Solomon's father gave him 8 marbles. 

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has is 20 (from Johanna) + 8 (from his father) = 28 marbles.

The store already had 50 marbles. 

The total number of marbles in the store is 50 (initial marbles) + 28 (new marbles) = 78 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, the total weight of marbles is 78 * 2 = 156 kgs.

"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply its length, width, and depth. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 5
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Since it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot.

Total cost = Volume * cost per cubic foot
Total cost = 120 * 0.1
Total cost = 12

The total cost to fill the pool is $12."
"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to first find the number of girls and nongendered children.

Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.

The number of nongendered children is 1/10 of the number of boys, which is 1/10 * 30 = 3.

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

The total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to first find the number of electric poles. 

Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles. 

Let's say the number of electric poles is x. Then, the number of electric wires is 3x. 

Since the total number of electric wires is 45, we can set up the equation: 3x = 45

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 45 / 3
x = 15

So, the number of electric poles required is 15.

"To find the total number of people at the party, we need to add the number of men and women. 

Total number of people = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who left as follows:

Number of people who left = 1/4 * 40 = 10 people

Since 22 men stayed at the party, the number of men who left is:

Number of men who left = 25 - 22 = 3 men

Now, we know that 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men. So, the number of women who left is:

Number of women who left = 10 - 3 = 7 women

To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:

Number of women left = 15 - 7 = 8 women

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the cost of the pen. 

First, we know the book costs $4. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Next, we know the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. So, the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1.

The final answer is $1."
"To find the total number of pencils, we need to add the pencils Jam has to the pencils Meg has. 

Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, so the total number of pencils Jam has is 3 * 24 (assuming each box has 24 pencils) + 2 = 74.

Adding Meg's pencils, the total number of pencils is 74 + 46 = 120.

Since each box can hold 24 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by 24 to find the number of boxes needed: 120 / 24 = 5.

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 5 boxes to store all their pencils.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cooling effect of the ice cubes and the added cream on the coffee. 

First, let's calculate the cooling effect of the ice cubes. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and Shannon adds 5 ice cubes to cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we can set up the equation:

5 * 13 = 65

This equation is true, so the cooling effect of the ice cubes is correct.

Now, let's calculate the weakening effect of the added cream. Each milliliter of cream makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Since Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, the weakening effect is:

15 * 12 = 180 milliliters

However, we need to consider that the coffee is already weakened by the cooling effect of the ice cubes. Since the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, it is 65 milliliters weaker. Therefore, the total weakening effect is the sum of the weakening effect of the cream and the initial weakening effect of the cooling:

65 + 180 = 245 milliliters

So, Shannon's iced coffee is 245 milliliters weaker.

Final answer: 245"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the ratio of old records to new records. We know that 2 old records can be traded for 1 new record. 

Given that 5 people come in and leave with 7 new records, we can set up an equation to represent the situation. Let's assume the number of old records brought in by the 5 people is x.

Since 2 old records can be traded for 1 new record, the total number of new records obtained is x/2.

We know that the total number of new records obtained is 7, so we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 7

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:

x = 7 * 2
x = 14

Therefore, the 5 people brought in 14 old records."
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to first find the number of junior and senior programmers.

The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 2/5 * 100 = 40.

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, the monthly salary of a senior programmer is $2000 + $400 = $2400.

The total number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60.

The total amount of money the company pays to junior programmers per month is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to senior programmers per month is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

We know that 20 people were on the bus when it reached the third stop. 

At the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in. This means that the number of people on the bus before the second stop is 20 - 8 = 12.

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in. So, the number of people on the bus before the first stop is 12 - 5 = 7.

Therefore, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 7.

1. He eats 2 lollipops on his way to school: 24 - 2 = 22
2. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends: 22 - 14 = 8
3. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends: 2 * 14 = 28, so he buys 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
4. He eats 3 lollipops that night: 36 - 3 = 33

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to minutes. 

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge. 

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it takes to recharge 40% as follows:

40% / 1% = 40
40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the total amount they spent after applying the rewards and the coupon.

First, let's calculate the rewards they received. They spent $80 and get $1 off for every $20 spent. So, they get 80 / 20 = 4 rewards. 

Since the rewards are $1 off, they get a total of 4 * $1 = $4 off.

However, the coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off, so the coupon takes 2 * $4 = $8 off.

Now, let's calculate the total amount they paid. They initially spent $80, then got $4 off, and then got $8 off from the coupon. So, the total amount they paid is 80 - 4 - 8 = $68.

The customer paid $68 on this shopping trip."

Combine like terms: 3c = 60. 

Divide both sides by 3: c = 20. 

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens: 2c = 2 * 20 = 40. 

The number of legs of cows is 4c, and the number of legs of chickens is 2 * 2c = 4c. 

The total number of legs is 4c + 4c = 8c.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the weights of the blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, and red bird.

Since the pink frog weighs 50 pounds and it weighs the same as the blue beetle, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, including the container itself. 

Total weight = weight of pink frog + weight of blue beetle + weight of green toad + weight of yellow snake + weight of red bird + weight of container
Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20
Total weight = 240 pounds"

Number of legs from tables with 3 legs: 50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs

Total number of legs = 160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs"
"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband.

Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

The total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since the bag has 36 cookies, the number of cookies left for Jenny to eat is 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To find the total cost of the shirts after the discount, we need to calculate the discount amount first. 

The original price of the shirts is 2 * $30 = $60. 

The discount is 40% of $60, which is 0.4 * $60 = $24. 

The total cost after the discount is $60 - $24 = $36.

The final answer is 36."
"To find the difference in daily revenue, we need to calculate the revenue from tractors and silos separately.

Daily revenue from tractors: 10 tractors * $100/tractor = $1000
Daily revenue from silos: 5 silos * $220/silo = $1100

Total daily revenue: $1000 + $1100 = $2100

Now, let's find the percentage increase in daily revenue:
Percentage increase = ((New revenue - Old revenue) / Old revenue) * 100
= (($1100 - $1000) / $1000) * 100
= (100 / 1000) * 100
= 10%

So, they are making 10% more per day now."
"To find the total monthly expenditure on the dog, we need to calculate the weekly expenditure and then multiply it by 4.

Weekly expenditure on food = $25
Weekly expenditure on treats = $20
Weekly expenditure on medicine = $100 / 4 = $25

Total weekly expenditure = $25 + $20 + $25 = $70

Total monthly expenditure = $70 * 4 = $280

Total yearly expenditure = $280 * 12 = $3360"
"To find the total time of Peyton's after-work activities, we need to calculate the time for each activity and add them together.

Monday's yoga class is 1 hour.
Tuesday's cooking class is 3 times as long as Monday's yoga, so it's 3 * 1 = 3 hours.
Wednesday's cheese-tasting event is 0.5 hours.
Thursday's museum tour is half as long as the cooking class, so it's 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours.
Friday's errands are 2 hours.

Now, let's add up the time for all activities: 
1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours.

The total time for Peyton's after-work activities is 7.5 hours."
"To find out how many plant pots April has left over, we need to first determine the total number of plant pots she needs for the daisies and roses. 

She needs 30 plant pots for the daisies and twice as many for the roses, so she needs 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots for the roses. 

In total, she needs 30 + 60 = 90 plant pots. 

Since she already had 100 plant pots, she has 100 - 90 = 10 plant pots left over.

"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent and gave away from the total amount she had initially.

Let's break it down:

Initial amount = $36
Amount spent on sweater = $11
Amount given to her brother = $4

Total amount spent = $11 + $4 = $15

Now, subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:
$36 - $15 = $21

So, Andrea saved $21.

21"
"To find the total time John spent on vacation, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them up.

Time spent boating = 6 hours
Time spent swimming = 6 / 2 = 3 hours
Time spent watching shows = 3 * 2 = 6 hours
Total time spent on these activities = 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours

Since 30% of his time was spent watching shows, we can set up an equation to find the total time spent on vacation:

0.3x = 15, where x is the total time spent on vacation

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.3:

x = 15 / 0.3
x = 50

Now that we know the total time spent on vacation, we can find the time spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time:

Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * 50
Time spent sightseeing = 20 hours

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and subtract the amount she already has.

First, let's calculate her earnings from the first job: 
20 hours * $10/hour = $200

Next, let's calculate her earnings from the second job: 
15 hours * $5/hour = $75

Now, let's add her earnings from both jobs: 
$200 + $75 = $275

Since Annabelle already has $80 in her savings, we subtract this amount from her total earnings: 
$275 - $80 = $195

Annabelle still needs $195 to save for the phone.

$195"
"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to first find the combined height of the shortest and the second tree. 

The shortest tree is 6 feet tall, and the second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so the second tree is 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.

The combined height of the two trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the two trees, so the tallest tree is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

The final answer is 34."
"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he bought and subtract that from the initial amount of money he had.

The total cost of the toy cars is 6 * $2 = $12.
The total cost of the teddy bears is 5 * $1 = $5.
The total cost of the items Dean bought is $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially had $28. After buying the items, he had $28 - $17 = $11.
His mother then gave him an extra $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

The final answer is 21."
"To determine the number of friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has available for the activities. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the activities: 

- 1 round of mini-golf costs $5
- 2 rides on the go-karts cost 2 * $10 = $20
- Arcade tokens cost $5

Total cost of activities = $5 + $20 + $5 = $30

Now, let's subtract the total cost of activities from the total budget: 

$90 - $30 = $60

Since each friend will also get $5 in arcade tokens, we need to subtract this amount from the remaining budget as well. 

$60 - $5 = $55

Now, we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend (including arcade tokens): 

$55 ÷ $10 = 5.5

Since we can't invite half a friend, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. 

Morgan can invite 5 friends."
"To find out how much money Marisa saves, we need to calculate the total amount she spends on lollipops and subtract that from her daily pocket money.

Daily pocket money: $5
Number of lollipops bought per day: 4
Cost of each lollipop: 25 cents = $0.25
Total cost of lollipops per day: 4 * $0.25 = $1
Total cost of lollipops for 5 days: $1 * 5 = $5

Since Marisa saves the change, we need to subtract the total cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money:
$5 (daily pocket money) - $5 (total cost of lollipops) = $0

So, Marisa saves $0 in her piggy bank for 5 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since Billy took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, the amount of money he had left is also $2. This means he had $10 - $2 = $8 left.

Now, we know that the total amount of money Billy had initially was $10, and he spent $8 on gumballs. So, the amount of money he spent on candy is $10 - $8 = $2.

Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, we can find the number of pounds of candy Billy bought by dividing the amount of money he spent on candy ($2) by the cost per pound ($1.5). 

Number of pounds of candy = $2 / $1.5 = 1.33 pounds.

The final answer is 1.33."
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S. 

We know that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, so we can write the equation as:

C = 2S - 5

We also know that Carver is 45 years old, so we can substitute C with 45:

45 = 2S - 5

Now, we can solve for S by adding 5 to both sides of the equation:

45 + 5 = 2S - 5 + 5
50 = 2S

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to find S:

50 / 2 = 2S / 2
25 = S

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to calculate the distance from the first city to the third city. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles, and from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the other two, so it is 75 + 100 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance for one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance by the service interval: 18,000 / 900 = 20 days.

The train goes between services every 20 days."
"To find the amount of stuffing needed for each type of bed, we need to calculate the average amount of stuffing for the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds.

The Rottweiler bed requires 8 pounds of stuffing, and the chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing. 

The average amount of stuffing for the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.

For 4 chihuahua beds, the total amount of stuffing needed is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

For 3 collie beds, the total amount of stuffing needed is 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

The total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds is 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time taken for the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the trip and then add them together.

Time taken to drive to his friend's house: 
Distance = 200 miles
Speed = 70 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 200 / 70 = 2.86 hours

Time taken for the detour: 
Distance = 10 miles
Speed = 70 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 10 / 70 = 0.14 hours

Time taken to drive back home: 
Distance = 240 miles
Speed = 80 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 240 / 80 = 3 hours

Total time taken for the trip = Time taken to drive to his friend's house + Time taken for the detour + Time taken to drive back home
Total time = 2.86 + 0.14 + 3 = 5.99 hours

The final answer is: 5.99"
"To find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to subtract the number of absent students from the total number of students.

First, let's find the total number of absent students: 
5 girls + 4 boys = 9 students

Now, subtract the number of absent students from the total number of students:
96 - 9 = 87

So, there were 87 fourth-grade students at Small Tree School on Friday.

The number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is 87 - 43 (number of girls) = 44."
"To find the number of boys, we need to divide the number of girls by 2, since there are twice as many boys as girls. 

Number of boys = Number of girls / 2
Number of boys = 6 / 2
Number of boys = 3

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as x. 

We are given that 3x - 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 

We also know that 3 times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, which means 3(3x - 5) were kicked out for physical violence.

The total number of people kicked out is 50. 

We can set up an equation to represent this:

x (refusing to wear masks) + (3x - 5) (shoplifting) + 3(3x - 5) (physical violence) = 50

Combine like terms:

x + 3x - 5 + 9x - 15 = 50

Combine like terms:

13x - 20 = 50

Add 20 to both sides:

13x = 70

Divide both sides by 13:

x = 5.38 (round down to 5 since you can't have a fraction of a person)

Now that we know x, we can find the number of people kicked out for shoplifting and physical violence:

Shoplifters: 3x - 5 = 3(5) - 5 = 10

Physical violence: 3(3x - 5) = 3(10) = 30

Now, we can find the number of people kicked out for other reasons by subtracting the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence from the total:

50 - 5 - 10 - 30 = 5

The number of people kicked out for other reasons is 5."
"To find Erin's initial score, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote Erin's initial score as E and Sara's initial score as S. 

We know that Erin scored 14 points, so E = 14. We also know that Erin has three times more points than Sara, so E = 3S. 

Now, we can substitute E = 14 into the equation E = 3S, which gives us 14 = 3S. 

To find S, we divide both sides by 3: S = 14 / 3 = 4.67. 

Since we know Sara's initial score, we can find Erin's initial score by adding the 14 points she scored to her initial score: E = 14 + 4.67 = 18.67.

The final answer is 18.67."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the expenses into different categories.

1. Picture frames: 
   Each frame costs $20, and 20% of that is $4. 
   So, the total cost for picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. Pins: 
   2 seniors will receive pins at $5 each, so the total cost for pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. Cords for officers: 
   1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 44 * 1/4 = 11 officers.
   Each cord costs $12, so the total cost for cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we add up the costs for picture frames, pins, and cords to get the total cost of the senior gifts.
$1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The total cost of the senior gifts is $1198."
"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the cost of the materials first. 

Let's assume the cost of materials is x. 

Since the DIY will save 20% after considering the materials cost, the cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper will be 80% of the original cost, which is 0.8 * 400 = 320. 

Now, we can set up an equation to find the cost of the materials: 
400 - x = 320 
x = 400 - 320 
x = 80 

So, the cost of the materials is $80. 

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is the cost of the materials plus the cost of the materials, which is 80 + 80 = 160."
"To find the total number of tennis shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs, so we need to subtract those from the total. 

The total number of shoes sold is 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 14 (Sunday) - 6 (returns) = 50 pairs.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total hours Hallie had dance practice per week, we need to add the hours she practiced on each day.

She practiced 1 hour on Tuesdays and 2 hours on Thursdays. 

The practice on Saturdays lasted twice as long as Tuesday's night class, so it is 1 * 2 = 2 hours.

Now, let's add the hours: 
1 (Tuesday) + 2 (Thursday) + 2 (Saturday) = 5 hours

So, Hallie had 5 hours of dance practice per week."
"To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to first calculate the number of faulty pieces of equipment and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

Let's assume the total number of pieces of equipment is x.

Since 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty, the number of faulty pieces is 0.4x.

The total cost of the equipment is $400,000, and this is the sum of the cost of the faulty pieces and the cost of the functioning pieces.

The cost of the faulty pieces is 0.4x.

The cost of the functioning pieces is 0.6x (since 60% of the pieces are functioning).

We know that the total cost is $400,000, so we can set up the equation:

0.4x + 0.6x = 400,000

Combine like terms:

1x = 400,000

Divide both sides by 1:

x = 400,000

Now that we know the total number of pieces is 400,000, we can find the number of functioning pieces:

Number of functioning pieces = 0.6x
= 0.6 * 400,000
= 240,000

The total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is:

Cost of functioning pieces = 0.6x
= 0.6 * 400,000
= 240,000"
"To find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from each half of the sheep and then add them together.

Since Mary has 30 sheep, she has 15 sheep in each half. 

She gets 1 kg of milk from half of the sheep, which is 15 sheep. So, the milk from this half is 15 * 1 = 15 kg.

She gets 2 kg of milk from the other half, which is also 15 sheep. So, the milk from this half is 15 * 2 = 30 kg.

Now, we add the milk from both halves: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

Therefore, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day."
"To find out how many pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we first need to determine how many rolls were left after feeding her 6 children. 

Since she made a dozen (12) bread rolls and fed 6 children, the number of rolls left is 12 - 6 = 6.

Then, she broke each of the remaining 6 rolls into 8 pieces. To find the total number of pieces, we multiply the number of rolls by the number of pieces each roll was broken into: 6 * 8 = 48.

Therefore, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

"To find the number of pupils who like yellow, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that half of the class likes blue. Since there are 40 pupils in total, half of them would be 40 / 2 = 20 pupils who like blue.

Now, we are left with 40 - 20 = 20 pupils who do not like blue.

One-fourth of the remaining 20 pupils likes green. To find one-fourth of 20, we divide 20 by 4: 20 / 4 = 5 pupils who like green.

Now, we subtract the pupils who like green from the remaining pupils to find the number of pupils who like yellow: 20 - 5 = 15 pupils who like yellow.

"To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we need to first determine the number of apples picked on Monday and Wednesday.

We know that Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday for $56 at $4 per piece. So, the number of apples picked on Monday is 56 / 4 = 14.

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked over the three days by adding the number of apples picked each day: 14 + 12 + 24 = 50.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of socks Lindsay has washed, we need to calculate the number of pairs and the number of loose socks separately. 

Since each pair consists of 2 socks, 10 pairs of socks would be 10 * 2 = 20 socks. Adding the 15 loose socks, Lindsay has washed a total of 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks in total, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is 50 - 35 = 15 socks."
"To find out how many cookies are left for Rachel, we need to subtract the number of cookies she initially had, the number of cookies Janet gave her, and the number of cookies her brother ate.

Initial cookies = 23
Cookies from Janet = 42
Cookies eaten by brother = 44

Total cookies initially = 23 + 42 = 65
Total cookies eaten or given away = 44 + 23 = 67

Cookies left = Total cookies initially - Total cookies eaten or given away
Cookies left = 65 - 67
Cookies left = -2

Since we cannot have a negative number of cookies, it seems there's an error in the problem statement. However, if we consider the problem as having 23 cookies initially, 42 cookies from Janet, and 44 cookies eaten by her brother, the correct calculation would be:

Cookies left = 23 + 42 - 44
Cookies left = 21

So, there are 21 cookies left for Rachel."
"To find the monthly payment, we can use the formula for calculating monthly payments on a loan:

M = P[r(1+r)^n]/[(1+r)^n - 1]

Where:
M = monthly payment
P = principal amount = $3,650
r = monthly interest rate = 10%/12 = 0.008333
n = number of payments = 5 months

M = 3650[0.008333(1+0.008333)^5]/[(1+0.008333)^5 - 1]
M ≈ 3650[0.008333(1.008333)^5]/[(1.008333)^5 - 1]
M ≈ 3650[0.008333(1.043383)]/(1.043383 - 1)
M ≈ 3650[0.008667]/0.043383
M ≈ 81.25

So, Karan has to pay approximately $81.25 per month.

The final answer is: $81.25"
"To find out how far Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time. 

Cho's distance = speed * time = 14 km/h * 8 h = 112 km

Chloe's distance = speed * time = 9 km/h * 5 h = 45 km

To find the difference, we subtract Chloe's distance from Cho's distance.

Difference = Cho's distance - Chloe's distance = 112 km - 45 km = 67 km

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the amount of silver and gold they have.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 + 100 = 150.
The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 + 120 = 200.

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 + 200 = 350.

"To find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make, we multiply the number of pitchers by the number of cups per pitcher: 3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups.

Since Millie sells each cup of lemonade for $1, her total revenue is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

To find the total number of hours she needs to sell all the lemonade, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups sold per hour: 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

Now, we can find the total profit by subtracting the initial cost from the total revenue: $36 - $18 = $18.

Finally, we can find the profit per hour by dividing the total profit by the number of hours: $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the initial amount of land as x hectares.

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, the amount he sold is 3/5 * x hectares. The amount he has left is 12.8 hectares, which is 2/5 of his initial land (since 1 - 3/5 = 2/5).

We can set up the equation as follows:

2/5 * x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

"To find the initial number of female members, we need to calculate 50% of 52, which is 0.5 * 52 = 26. 

Since half the people performing can't make it, we need to find half of the total number of people performing. The total number of people performing initially is the number of female members (26) plus the 3 teachers, which is 26 + 3 = 29. Half of 29 is 29 / 2 = 14.5. Since we can't have half a person, we'll round down to 14.

So, the number of people who can't make it is 14, and the number of people who can perform is 29 - 14 = 15. 

The total number of people who sang in the performance is 26 (initial female members) + 3 (teachers) + 15 (those who can perform) = 44."

"To determine how much David saves, we need to calculate the cost of buying tickets for both of them and compare it to the cost of buying a ride bracelet for both of them.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying tickets for both of them. Each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, so the cost of one ride is 2 * 2 = $4. Since they want to ride all 9 rides, the total cost of tickets for both of them is 9 * 4 = $36.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying a ride bracelet for both of them. The cost of a ride bracelet is $30.

To find out how much David saves, we subtract the cost of the ride bracelet from the cost of buying tickets: 36 - 30 = $6.

David saves $6 by buying a ride bracelet instead of buying tickets."
"To determine how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to divide the total amount of ribbon she has by the total number of gifts she needs to wrap.

First, let's calculate the total number of gifts Monica needs to wrap: 
6 (for her family) + 4 (for her friends) + 2 (for her teachers) = 12 gifts

Now, we can divide the total amount of ribbon (144 inches) by the total number of gifts (12):
144 inches / 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To find the number of popsicles each person has, we need to divide the total number of popsicles by the sum of the parts in the ratio (5 + 6 = 11) and then multiply the result by the respective parts of the ratio.

Let's calculate the number of popsicles each person has:

Betty's popsicles = (5/11) * 165 = 75
Sam's popsicles = (6/11) * 165 = 90

To find the difference, subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
90 - 75 = 15

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total cost of the streaming services, we need to calculate the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus after the 20% discount.

Original cost of Hulu and Disney Plus: $10 + $10 = $20
Discount: 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4
Cost after discount: $20 - $4 = $16

Total cost of streaming services: $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his cable subscription:

Original cost of cable subscription: $60
Cost of streaming services: $26
Savings: $60 - $26 = $34

Tim saves $34 by cancelling his cable subscription."
"To find the total work time, we need to convert the time spent editing from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 90 minutes is equal to 1.5 hours.

Total work time = Time spent writing + Time spent recording + Time spent editing
Total work time = 4 hours + 2 hours + 1.5 hours
Total work time = 7.5 hours

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we divide the time spent editing by the total work time and multiply by 100.

Percentage of time spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total work time) * 100
Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 hours / 7.5 hours) * 100
Percentage of time spent editing = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of time spent editing = 20%

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of books Wendy needs, we first need to calculate the total capacity of the shelving system. Since it has 6 rows and 6 columns, the total capacity is 6 * 6 = 36 books.

Now, Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books. Double the number of books is 2 * 36 = 72. Adding 20 more books to this gives us 72 + 20 = 92 books.

Therefore, Wendy will need 92 books to complete her task.

92"
"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, the number of cards she gave away, and the number of cards she received.

Initially, Erica made 20 cards and her dad brought her 2 boxes of 15 cards each, so she had 20 + (2 * 15) = 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

She gave away 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, so she gave away a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

She received 17 cards from family and friends.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica has: 
50 (initial cards) - 29 (cards given away) + 17 (cards received) = 38

So, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards.

38"
"To find out how many slices are left, we first need to calculate how many slices Jenny gave away. 

Jenny gave 1/3 of 12 slices to Bill, which is (1/3) * 12 = 4 slices. 
She gave 1/4 of 12 slices to Mark, which is (1/4) * 12 = 3 slices.

In total, Jenny gave away 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Initially, there were 12 slices. After giving away 7 slices, Jenny has 12 - 7 = 5 slices left.

Jenny then eats 2 slices, leaving her with 5 - 2 = 3 slices.

The final answer is: 3"

"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we need to calculate the total amount of each ingredient required for a quadruple batch of brownies.

For a quadruple batch, Mark needs 4 times the amount of the normal recipe. 

For flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
For milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs to buy 12 / 2 = 6 bags of flour.

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark needs to buy 4 / 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour: 6 - 2 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the total energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days. 

First, we calculate the daily energy usage: 
900 watts/hour * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (or 7.2 kilowatt-hours) per day.

Next, we calculate the total energy used in 30 days: 
7.2 kilowatt-hours/day * 30 days = 216 kilowatt-hours.

Now, we calculate the new daily energy usage after reducing the time by 5 hours: 
900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours (or 2.7 kilowatt-hours) per day.

Then, we calculate the new total energy usage in 30 days: 
2.7 kilowatt-hours/day * 30 days = 81 kilowatt-hours.

The energy saved is the difference between the original and new total energy usage: 
216 kilowatt-hours - 81 kilowatt-hours = 135 kilowatt-hours.

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the average number of stripes, we need to first find the total number of stripes. 

Two zebras with 17 stripes each have 2 * 17 = 34 stripes. 
Adding the zebra with 36 stripes, the total number of stripes is 34 + 36 = 70. 
The zebra with half the number of stripes of the second zebra has 36 / 2 = 18 stripes. 
Adding this to the total, we get 70 + 18 = 88 stripes. 

To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras, which is 3. 
88 / 3 = 29.33. 

The average number of stripes is 29.33."
"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we need to calculate the total amount of each required for 20 people.

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and each sandwich serves 4 people, we can calculate the total amount of each needed for 20 people as follows:

Meat: 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches
Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat, we need 5 pounds of meat.

Cheese: 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches
Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of cheese, we need 5 pounds of cheese.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese:

Cost of meat: 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
Cost of cheese: 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

Total cost: $35.00 (meat) + $15.00 (cheese) = $50.00

The final answer is: $50.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in his house.

We know that Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, we can set up an equation to find the number of corns:

Let's denote the number of corns as C. Since there are twice as many corns as cannolis, we can write:

C = 2 * 40
C = 80

Now, we know that Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is:

40 + 60 = 100

We also know that he bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Since he had 80 corns initially, the new total number of corns is:

80 - 40 = 40

Now, we can find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis:

Total = 100 (cannolis) + 40 (corns)
Total = 140

The final answer is: 140"
"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first calculate the total steps he completed before the jog. 

He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. 

Then, he did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. 

So, the total steps completed before the jog is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. 

To find out how many steps he took during the jog, we subtract the steps left from the total steps completed before the jog: 6,000 - 2,000 = 4,000 steps.

"To find out how long it will take Toby to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of words in the book by his reading rate.

Total words in the book = 45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words
Time to finish the book = Total words in the book / Reading rate = 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

Since Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 30 minutes to finish the book, he will arrive at the airport 60 - 30 = 30 minutes early."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. 

Total hours worked in May = 40 employees * 40 hours/week = 1600 hours
Total amount paid in May = 1600 hours * $15/hour = $24,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the company had 3/4 of the original 40 employees, which is 30 employees.

Total hours worked in June = 30 employees * 40 hours/week = 1200 hours
Total amount paid in June = 1200 hours * $15/hour = $18,000

Total amount paid in the two months = $24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds, and the first pound is full price ($3), the second pound is half off ($3 * 0.5 = $1.50). So the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50, and the 4 magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1. So the total cost of the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1 = $2.50.

Now, let's add the cost of the taffy and the seashells and magnets to find the total cost of the items purchased: $4.50 + $2.50 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks first. 

The first package costs $400. The second package is worth twice that much, so it costs 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packages, so the discount amount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.2 * $1200 = $240.

The discounted cost of the two packages is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Adding the cost of the finale firework, the total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine the number of dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she needs for 30 days. Since she eats 2 cookies per night, she will need 2 * 30 = 60 cookies for 30 days.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies needed (60) by the number of cookies per dozen (12) to find out how many dozens she needs to make:

60 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5 dozens

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days."
"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the intersection of the two events. 

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the candles have this defect, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of candles smelling like wet dog = Total number of candles * Percentage of candles smelling like wet dog
= 50000 * 0.05
= 2500

Next, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, the problem doesn't provide a direct relationship between the two events. Assuming that the probability of a candle exploding is independent of its smell, we can't directly calculate the intersection. 

But, we can assume that the 5% of candles that smell like wet dog are also the ones that explode, as the problem states that 5% of the more dangerous candles have this defect. 

So, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode = Number of candles smelling like wet dog
= 2500

The final answer is 2500."
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to first calculate the discount amount for each blouse. Since the blouses are 30% off, we can calculate the discount as follows:

Discount per blouse = 30% of $20
= 0.30 * $20
= $6

Now, we can calculate the discounted price for each blouse:

Discounted price per blouse = Regular price - Discount
= $20 - $6
= $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

Total cost = Discounted price per blouse * Number of blouses
= $14 * 4
= $56

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of apples gathered from the tallest trees as T, the number of apples gathered from the shortest trees as S, and the number of apples gathered from the average trees as A.

We know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so T = 30.

We also know that Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so S = 30/2 = 15.

We know that Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister's T = 2 * 30 = 60.

We also know that Joanne's sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so her sister's S = 3 * 15 = 45.

Since the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, we can set up the equation:

T + S + A = 500

Substituting the values we know, we get:

30 + 15 + A = 500

Combine the constants:

45 + A = 500

Subtract 45 from both sides:

A = 455

Therefore, Joanne gathered 455 apples from the average trees.

The final answer is: 455"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, the total number of bumps can be represented as 2C + D = 304.

We also know that the total number of heads is 180, and since each animal has one head, we can write the equation C + D = 180.

Now we have two equations:

1) 2C + D = 304
2) C + D = 180

We can solve these equations simultaneously. Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1), we get:

2C + D - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into equation (2) to find the number of dromedaries:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.

"To find the total distance Tom traveled, we need to break it down into parts.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.

For the next 2 days, he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers.

So, the total distance covered in the first 6 days is 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers.

On the 7th day, Tom wasn't traveling at all, so the distance covered on that day is 0 kilometers.

During the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total distance covered in the second week is 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, we add the distances covered in the first 6 days and the second week: 1040 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

Therefore, Tom traveled a total of 3140 kilometers during his two-week-long trip.

"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can set up the equation:

1/4 * Zack's locker = 5

To find Zack's locker, we multiply both sides by 4:

Zack's locker = 5 * 4
Zack's locker = 20 cubic inches

Since Timothy's locker is half as big as Zack's locker, we can set up the equation:

Timothy's locker = 1/2 * Zack's locker
Timothy's locker = 1/2 * 20
Timothy's locker = 10 cubic inches

Elevation of Stanley's comb = 10,000 feet + 4,000 feet = 14,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation of Stanley's comb (14,000 feet) and Oliver's current elevation (3,000 feet). 

Difference in elevation = 14,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 11,000 feet

For the next 8 months, the cost is 8 * $12 = $96.

For the final 20 months, the cost is 20 * $14 = $280.

Now, we add the costs of all three periods: $48 + $96 + $280 = $424.

The total cost of 2 years of the service is $424."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the original price of the jogger jeans. 

Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the original price of the tattered jeans is x + 6.

We know that Cole saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. 

The amount saved from the jogger jeans is 1/3 of its original price, which is (1/3)x. The amount saved from the tattered jeans is the rest, which is (2/3)(x + 6).

Since the total savings is $6, we can set up the equation:

(1/3)x + (2/3)(x + 6) = 6

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to eliminate the fractions:

x + 2(x + 6) = 18

Expanding the equation, we get:

x + 2x + 12 = 18

Combine like terms:

3x + 12 = 18

Subtract 12 from both sides:

3x = 6

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 2

So, the original price of the jogger jeans is $2. 

Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the original price of the tattered jeans is $2 + 6 = $8.

The difference in the original price of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $8 - $2 = $6.

The final answer is: 6"

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder. 

Let's denote the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders as x. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is x + 10.

We know that Lillian builds 3 homemade feeders and buys 3 store-bought feeders. So, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10) and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x.

Since the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same, we can set up the equation:

3(x + 10) = 3x

Expanding the equation, we get:

3x + 30 = 3x

Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get:

30 = 0

This equation is not true, which means that the initial assumption that the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same is incorrect. However, we can still solve for x.

Let's re-examine the problem. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, we can set up the equation:

3(x + 10) = 3x + 30

Expanding the equation, we get:

3x + 30 = 3x + 30

This equation is true for any value of x, which means that the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is indeed 10 more than the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders.

Since Lillian builds 3 homemade feeders and buys 3 store-bought feeders, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10) and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x.

The total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the sum of the birds attracted to each type:

3(x + 10) + 3x = 6x + 30

Since the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same, we can set up the equation:

6x + 30 = 3x + 30

Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get:

3x + 30 = 30

Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get:

3x = 0

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

x = 0

This means that the store-bought feeders attract 0 birds, which is not possible. However, we can re-examine the problem.

Let's re-evaluate the equation:

3(x + 10) = 3x + 30

Expanding the equation, we get:

3x + 30 = 3x + 30

This equation is true for any value of x, which means that the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is indeed 10 more than the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders.

Since Lillian builds 3 homemade feeders and buys 3 store-bought feeders, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10) and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x.

The total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the sum of the birds attracted to each type:

3(x + 10) + 3x = 6x + 30

Since the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same, we can set up the equation:

6x + 30 = 3x + 30

Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get:

3x + 30 = 30

Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get:

3x = 0

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

x = 0

This means that the store-bought feeders attract 0 birds, which is not possible. However, we can re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-evaluate the equation:

3(x + 10) = 3x + 30

Expanding the equation, we get:

3x + 30 = 3x + 30

This equation is true for any value of x, which means that the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is indeed 10 more than the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders.

"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The bagel costs $4. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, so the soup costs $4 + (25% of $4) = $4 + $1 = $5.

The cake is half the price of the bagel, so the cake costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add the costs of the bagel, soup, and cake together: $4 + $5 + $2 = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much money Kenny has in total. We know he has $50 in spending cash and he also gets to keep 1/3 of the cards, which implies he gets 1/3 of the money from selling the cards. 

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny starts with as 'x'. Since he sells each card for $1.5, the total amount of money he gets from selling the cards is 1.5x.

We know that he keeps 1/3 of the cards and gets 1/3 of the money, so the amount of money he keeps is 1/3 * 1.5x = 0.5x.

The total amount of money Kenny has is the sum of the money he gets from selling the cards and the money he keeps, which is 1.5x + 0.5x = 2x.

We also know that the total amount of money Kenny has is $100, so we can set up the equation 2x = 100.

Solving for x, we get x = 100 / 2 = 50.

Therefore, Kenny starts with 50 cards.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many hotdogs the caterer prepared. Since the caterer prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs, we can calculate the total number of hotdogs as follows:

Total guests = 36
Hotdogs per guest for half of the guests = 2
Number of guests who got two hotdogs = 36 / 2 = 18
Total hotdogs prepared = 18 * 2 = 36

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. So, the total number of hotdogs needed is:
Total hotdogs needed = 40 * 2 = 80

Since the caterer prepared 36 hotdogs, which is less than the total number needed, some guests will not get a second hotdog. To find out how many, we subtract the total hotdogs prepared from the total hotdogs needed:
Hotdogs not provided = Total hotdogs needed - Total hotdogs prepared
Hotdogs not provided = 80 - 36
Hotdogs not provided = 44

Therefore, 44 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is: 44"
"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we first need to find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Indras has 6 letters, so half of that is 6 / 2 = 3. 

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than that, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Now, we need to find the total number of letters in both names. 
The total number of letters is 6 (Indras' name) + 7 (sister's name) = 13.

The final answer is 13."
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then apply the 20% discount.

The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00.
The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00.
The cost of the 5 utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost of the items is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

To apply the 20% discount, we need to calculate 20% of $165.00, which is 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

The discount amount is $33.00, so the final cost of the order will be $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

The final answer is: $132.00"
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and subtract the amount of money she already has.

"To find out how many gallons Josey needed, we need to calculate 1/4 of 15 gallons. 

1 gallon is equal to 8 pints. So, 1/4 of 15 gallons is (1/4) * 15 = 3.75 gallons.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints, we can convert 3.75 gallons to pints by multiplying 3.75 by 8. 

3.75 * 8 = 30 pints.

Therefore, Josey needed 30 pints of gasoline to run her lawnmower.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George spent on chips. Since he got 1% of his money left, that means he spent 99% of his money. 

George spent 99% of $5, which is 0.99 * 5 = $4.95. 

Since each bag of chips costs 40 cents, the number of bags he bought is 4.95 / 0.40 = 12.375. Since you can't buy a fraction of a bag, we'll round down to 12 bags.

Now, we know that George spent $4.95 on chips. He had $5 initially, so he must have spent $5 - $4.95 = $0.05 on candy bars.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, the number of candy bars he bought is 0.05 / 0.75 = 0.0667. Since you can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we'll round down to 0 candy bars.

However, this doesn't make sense, as George must have bought at least one candy bar. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

We know that George spent $4.95 on chips and had $0.05 left. This means he had $5 - $4.95 = $0.05 left, which is 1% of his money. 

Since 1% of his money is $0.05, 100% of his money is $0.05 / 0.01 = $5. 

Now, we know that George spent $4.95 on chips. He had $5 initially, so he must have spent $5 - $4.95 = $0.05 on candy bars.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, the number of candy bars he bought is 0.05 / 0.75 = 0.0667. Since you can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we'll round down to 0 candy bars.

However, this still doesn't make sense. Let's re-evaluate the problem again.

We know that George spent $4.95 on chips and had $0.05 left. This means he had $5 initially, and 1% of his money is $0.05. 

Since 1% of his money is $0.05, 100% of his money is $0.05 / 0.01 = $5. 

Now, we know that George spent $4.95 on chips. He had $5 initially, so he must have spent $5 - $4.95 = $0.05 on candy bars.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, the number of candy bars he bought is 0.05 / 0.75 = 0.0667. Since you can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we'll round up to 1 candy bar.

"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends.

First, we need to find the number of lollipops Ray shared with his friends. 
Remaining lollipops = Total lollipops - Lollipops kept by Ray
Remaining lollipops = 25 - 5
Remaining lollipops = 20

Now, we divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends.
Number of friends = 4
Lollipops per friend = Remaining lollipops / Number of friends
Lollipops per friend = 20 / 4
Lollipops per friend = 5

Each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops."

Weight of the pieces = 20 / 8 = 2.5 ounces per piece

Weight of the two pieces = 2.5 * 2 = 5 ounces

Weight of the remaining cake = Weight of the cake - Weight of the two pieces

Everyone will get 7 oranges."
"To find the total cost of the ingredients, we need to calculate the cost of the onions and the beef stock.

The cost of the onions is 2 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $4.00.

Since Antoine likes to double the amount of onions, he needs 2 * 2 pounds = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of the onions is 4 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $8.00.

The cost of the beef stock is 2 boxes * $2.00 per box = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

Since the soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 people = $2.00 per serving.

The final answer is: $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes Bernadette to drive to the theater and then calculate how much earlier she should leave.

Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to drive to the theater, the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to drive to the theater, Bernadette should leave 4 + 5 = 9 minutes before Wayne.

However, we also need to consider the time it takes Bernadette to drive to the theater. Since it takes her 16 minutes to drive to the theater, she should leave 16 + 9 = 25 minutes before Wayne.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 25 minutes before Wayne to arrive at the theater first.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we can convert 3 yards to feet by multiplying 3 by 3.

3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now that we have the length in feet, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:

Area = Length * Width
360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of Billie's room is 98 feet."
"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads each one bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Elizabeth has:
1 (red) + 2 * 20 (clear) = 1 + 40 = 41 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Margareth has:
3 (blue) + 4 * 20 (red) = 3 + 80 = 83 beads

Now, to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has:
83 (Margareth) - 41 (Elizabeth) = 42

The answer is 42."
"To find the final temperature of the house, we need to calculate the temperature change due to baking and then subtract the cooling effect.

First, let's calculate the temperature change due to baking:
Temperature change = 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees

Now, let's calculate the cooling effect:
Cooling rate = 2 degrees/10 minutes = 0.2 degrees/minute
Cooling time = 30 minutes
Temperature change due to cooling = 0.2 degrees/minute * 30 minutes = 6 degrees

Now, we subtract the cooling effect from the temperature change due to baking:
Final temperature = Initial temperature + Temperature change due to baking - Temperature change due to cooling
Final temperature = 40 + 15 - 6
Final temperature = 49 degrees

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the time it took Jon to complete the entire triathlon. 

Jon's total time = swim time + bike time + run time
Jon's total time = 40 minutes + 1 hour 20 minutes + 50 minutes
Jon's total time = 40 + 80 + 50
Jon's total time = 170 minutes

Since James finishes the swim 10% faster, we need to calculate James' swim time.
James' swim time = Jon's swim time - 10% of Jon's swim time
James' swim time = 40 - 0.1 * 40
James' swim time = 40 - 4
James' swim time = 36 minutes

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike, so we need to calculate James' bike time.
James' bike time = Jon's bike time + 5 minutes
James' bike time = 1 hour 20 minutes + 5 minutes
James' bike time = 80 + 5
James' bike time = 85 minutes

Now, we know James' swim time and bike time. We can calculate James' total time.
James' total time = James' swim time + James' bike time + James' run time
We are given that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time.
James' total time = Jon's total time + 10 minutes
James' total time = 170 + 10
James' total time = 180 minutes

Now, we can calculate James' run time.
James' run time = James' total time - James' swim time - James' bike time
James' run time = 180 - 36 - 85
James' run time = 59 minutes

The final answer is 59."
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie C in minutes. 

Since Movie C was 1.25 hours, we convert it to minutes by multiplying by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Now, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, the length of Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Since Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, we divide the length of Movie B by 4 to find the length of Movie A.

80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

The length of Movie A is 20 minutes."

Distance = 32 MPH * 0.5 hours (since 30 minutes is 0.5 hours)
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, the total amount of hay eaten is:
Total hay = 16 miles * 0.5 bails/mile
Total hay = 8 bails

The cost of the hay is:
Cost = Total hay * Cost per bail
Cost = 8 bails * $3/bail
Cost = $24

Michael has six 5-dollar bills, so he has a total of:
Total money = 6 * $5
Total money = $30

To find the change, we subtract the cost of the hay from the total money:
Change = Total money - Cost
Change = $30 - $24
Change = $6"
"To find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total, we need to calculate the number of eggs in the cases and the loose eggs. 

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs is 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass needs 5 eggs, so to find out how many glasses she can fill, we divide the total number of eggs by 5. 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays Rozanne can put out. 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many points Joey is winning, we need to subtract the points Marcy scored from the points Joey scored.

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's calculate the revenue from selling 17 sneakers at $20 each:
17 sneakers * $20 = $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling the remaining sneakers at $25 each. There were 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left.
31 sneakers * $25 = $775

Total revenue = $340 + $775 = $1115

Now, let's calculate the profit:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $1115 - $576
Profit = $539

The salesman's profit is $539."
"To find the total number of colors Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of colors in each type of packet and then add them together.

Six packets had eight colors each, so the total number of colors in these packets is 6 * 8 = 48.

Four packets had sixteen colors each, so the total number of colors in these packets is 4 * 16 = 64.

Now, we add the total number of colors from both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112.

Therefore, Beatrice bought 112 colors of crayons in all.

112"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's denote the price of a regular movie ticket as x and the price of a regular popcorn as y.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the cost of the movie ticket and the popcorn and soda together is $2 more than the cost of the super ticket.

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and the cost of the popcorn and soda is $1 + $3 = $4.

So, the equation becomes: x + y + 4 = 20 + 2

Simplifying the equation: x + y + 4 = 22

Subtract 4 from both sides: x + y = 18

We know that the cost of the movie ticket is $12, so we can substitute x = 12 into the equation:

12 + y = 18

Subtract 12 from both sides: y = 6

The regular price of popcorn is $6."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the original cost of filling one balloon. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as x. 

The total cost of filling 20 balloons is $900, so we can set up the equation: 
20x = 900

Dividing both sides by 20, we get:
x = 900 / 20
x = 45

Now that we know the original cost of filling one balloon is $45, we can find the new cost of filling one balloon after the price increase. 
The new cost is $45 + $20 = $65.

To find the total cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we multiply the new cost by 170:
Total cost = 170 * 65
Total cost = 11,150

The final answer is 11,150."
"To find the average speed of the car, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Distance = Speed * Time
For the first part of the trip, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours, so the distance covered is:
Distance1 = 60 * 2 = 120 miles

For the second part of the trip, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance covered is:
Distance2 = 30 * 1 = 30 miles

Total distance = Distance1 + Distance2 = 120 + 30 = 150 miles

Total time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 150 / 3 = 50 mph

The car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."
"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she received.

Initially, Jenna had 8 sapphires worth $800. After trading 3 sapphires, she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

The value of the remaining sapphires is 5 * $800 = $4000.

Jenna received 2 rubies worth $1200 each, so the total value of the rubies is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of all her jewels is $4000 (sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"
"To find the total number of apples eaten, we need to multiply the number of apples each person eats per day by the number of days.

Marin eats 4 apples/day, and Nancy eats 4 apples/day.

"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds.

The volume of one raised bed is length * width * height = 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost will be 160 * 12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of cards, we need to first calculate the number of green cards. 

Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:
Number of green cards = 15 (red cards) + 60% of 15
= 15 + 0.6 * 15
= 15 + 9
= 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards.
Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards.
Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

The final answer is: 78"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. 

Twenty minutes later, half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. 
Half of 50 is 25, so 25 fairies joined from the east. 
Now, the total number of fairies is 50 (initial) + 25 (new) = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. 
So, the remaining number of fairies is 75 - 30 = 45.

The final answer is 45."
"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add the number of puppies Jennifer's dog has to the number of puppies Brandon's dog has. 

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. 
Total puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Now, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. 
Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. 
Total puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we divide the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

The final answer is 35%"
"To determine the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of each item and add them together.

The total weight of the sugar cubes is 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

The total weight of the carrots is 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

The total weight of the hay is 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

The total weight of the oats is 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

The total weight of all the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4400 pounds.

To find the number of trips, we divide the total weight of the feed by the capacity of the truck: 4400 / 2250 = 1.96.

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her earnings per week and then multiply it by 4.

Grayson earns 2 cents for each aluminum can and 3 cents for each plastic bottle. She drinks 3 aluminum cans and 5 plastic bottles per week. 

Earnings from aluminum cans per week = 3 cans * 2 cents = 6 cents
Earnings from plastic bottles per week = 5 bottles * 3 cents = 15 cents

Total earnings per week = 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents

Now, we multiply the total earnings per week by 4 to find out her earnings in a four-week month:
Total earnings in a four-week month = 21 cents * 4 = 84 cents

The final answer is 84."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, we can calculate Toni's plants as follows:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + 60% of Frederick's plants
Toni's plants = 10 + 0.6 * 10
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find out how many plants Shondra has. Since Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, we can calculate Shondra's plants as follows:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

"To find the total number of cards Miss Maria has, we need to calculate the total number of basketball cards and baseball cards separately.

Total basketball cards = 6 decks * 25 cards per deck = 6 * 25 = 150 cards
Total baseball cards = 5 boxes * 40 cards per box = 5 * 40 = 200 cards

Total cards = Total basketball cards + Total baseball cards = 150 + 200 = 350 cards

Since Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, the remaining cards are given to her students. 

Number of cards given to students = Total cards - Cards kept by Miss Maria = 350 - 50 = 300 cards

Since each student received 10 cards, we can find the number of students by dividing the total cards given to students by 10.

Number of students = Number of cards given to students / 10 = 300 / 10 = 30

The final answer is 30."
"To find out how much Becky paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples she bought and subtract the discount.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each, so the total cost is 20 * 0.45 = $9. 

Becky received a $1 discount, so she paid 9 - 1 = $8.

To find out how much Kelly paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples she bought and subtract the discount.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each, so the total cost is 20 * 0.50 = $10.

Kelly received a 10 percent discount, which is 0.10 * 10 = $1.

So, Kelly paid 10 - 1 = $9.

To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we subtract Becky's total from Kelly's total: 9 - 8 = $1.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. 

Since Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, and he gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies."
"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 6 inches to feet as follows:

6 inches / 12 inches/foot = 0.5 feet

Since there are 2 remoras, we multiply the length of one remora by 2:

2 * 0.5 feet = 1 foot

Now, we can find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents:

(1 foot / 10 feet) * 100% = 10%

The combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length."

We can set up the equation as follows:

(3/4)x + 20 = x

To solve for x, we can first multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to eliminate the fraction:

3x + 80 = 4x

Now, we can subtract 3x from both sides of the equation:

80 = x

So, the total number of students at that grade level is 80."

"To find out how many books each child got, we need to first find out how many books Sarah bought. 

Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can divide the total amount spent by the cost of each book to find the total number of books.

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost per book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by 4 to find out how many books each child got.

Number of books per child = Total number of books / Number of kids
Number of books per child = 20 / 4
Number of books per child = 5

The final answer is 5."

"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets, the cost of the hotel, and then add them together.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 per person, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 x $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. To find the cost of the hotel, we need to calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.2 x $1500 = $300. Then, we add this to the normal price: $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day. Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 x $1800 = $5400.

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

"To determine the total amount of oats needed, we first need to calculate the daily consumption of oats by all four horses. Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and they are fed twice a day. 

Daily consumption per horse = 5 pounds/meal * 2 meals = 10 pounds
Daily consumption for all horses = 10 pounds/horse * 4 horses = 40 pounds

Since Uncle Ben needs oats for five days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5:
Total oats needed for 5 days = 40 pounds/day * 5 days = 200 pounds

Now, we need to find out how many bags of oats are required. Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats. To find the number of bags needed, we divide the total amount of oats required by the weight of each bag:

Since each pack costs $4.00 and they are on sale for buy one get one free, the total cost for 2 packs will be the cost of 1 pack, which is $4.00. 

However, Heather also has a $2.00 coupon. So, the total cost will be $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, the cost of each individual razor will be $2.00 / 4 = $0.50.

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each layer and add them together.

The bottom layer consists of 4 girls, each 64"" tall. So, the height of the bottom layer is 4 * 64"" = 256"".

The next layer consists of 3 girls, each standing on top of the 4 girls below. Since the 10th girl is 60"" tall, the average height of this layer is (64 + 64 + 64 + 60) / 4 = 64"" (since the 10th girl is the shortest and will be at the top). The height of this layer is 3 * 64"" = 192"".

The top layer consists of 2 girls, each standing on top of the 3 girls below. The average height of this layer is (64 + 64) / 2 = 64"". The height of this layer is 2 * 64"" = 128"".

Now, we add the heights of all the layers together: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" = 576"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 576"" / 12 = 48 feet.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total minutes Charisma walks in 5 days, we need to calculate the number of times she gets up and walks in 5 days. Since she walks every hour, and there are 24 hours in a day, we can multiply the number of hours she works per day by the number of days.

8 hours/day * 5 days = 40 hours

Since she walks for 5 minutes every hour, we multiply the total hours by 5:

40 hours * 5 minutes/hour = 200 minutes

Charisma walks for 200 minutes in 5 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote Angela's current age as 'A'. 

Since Brett is 14 years old now, in four years, he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.

According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. So, we can set up the equation:

A + 4 = 3 * 14

Simplifying the equation:

A + 4 = 42

Subtracting 4 from both sides:

A = 38

So, Angela is currently 38 years old.

"To find the total amount Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of morning rides and afternoon rides separately and then add them together.

Morning rides: 2 rides per day * 14 days = 28 rides
Cost of morning rides: 28 rides * $6 per ride = $168

Afternoon rides: 2 rides per day * 14 days = 28 rides
Cost of afternoon rides: 28 rides * $2 per ride = $56

Total cost: $168 (morning rides) + $56 (afternoon rides) = $224

"To find the total number of oranges, we need to calculate the number of oranges Ashley and Brianne brought.

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so Ashley brought 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne brought 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

The total number of oranges is 50 + 70 = 120.

Since one Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, the total number of pies they can make is 120 / 3 = 40.

"To find the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) plus $5x (food cost). 
The cost of the second venue is $25x (per person charge).

We want to find when these two costs are equal, so we set them equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

So, 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the number of insects each person found. Let's say Bodhi found x insects. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found x/2 insects. 

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found x/2 + 7 insects.

We are also given that the total number of insects collected is 43. So, we can set up the equation:

x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms:

2x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found:

David found x/2 = 18/2 = 9 insects.

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found:

Lily found x/2 + 7 = 18/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 insects.

"To find the length of the couch, we need to first find the width of the rug. 

Since the chair is 3 feet wide and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, the width of the rug is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. 

Adding 2 feet to this, we get the length of the couch: 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total amount Suzie paid for the grape and green apple gum. 

She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum and half as much for a pack of green apple gum, which is $2 / 2 = $1. 

The total amount she paid for these two packs is $2 + $1 = $3. 

Since she paid $7 in total, the amount she paid for the strawberry gum is $7 - $3 = $4. 

Since she bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, the cost of each pack is $4 / 2 = $2.

"To find the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the cost of a pair of snowshoes. 

Since each dog has 4 legs, we need 2 pairs of snowshoes for each dog. 

Number of dogs = 6
Number of pairs of snowshoes per dog = 2
Cost per pair of snowshoes = $12.00

Total number of pairs of snowshoes = Number of dogs * Number of pairs of snowshoes per dog
Total number of pairs of snowshoes = 6 * 2
Total number of pairs of snowshoes = 12

Total cost = Total number of pairs of snowshoes * Cost per pair of snowshoes
Total cost = 12 * $12.00
Total cost = $144.00

The total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $144.00."
"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week and subtract the cost of the weekly pass.

Janet takes two bus trips per day, five days a week. So, the total number of bus trips per week is 2 * 5 = 10.

The cost of each bus trip is $2.20, so the total cost of her bus trips per week is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

The weekly bus pass costs $20. To find the savings, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of her bus trips: $22 - $20 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of cows and sheep in each location.

The farm has 30 cows. 
The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, we can find the total number of animals in each location:
Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

The total number of animals in both locations is 40 + 80 = 120.

"To determine the daily calorie deficit needed for Andy to reach his goal, we need to calculate the total number of days he has to lose weight and the total calories he needs to burn.

Andy's birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. So, he has approximately 8 months and 20 days to lose weight.

First, let's calculate the total number of days: 
August (31 days) + September (30 days) + October (31 days) + November (30 days) + December (31 days) + January (31 days) + February (28 or 29 days, depending on the year) + March (31 days) + April (30 days) + May (31 days) + June (30 days) + July (19 days) = 308 days

Since Andy needs to lose 30 lbs, and each pound requires a 3500 calorie deficit, the total calories he needs to burn is:
30 lbs * 3500 calories/lb = 105,000 calories

Now, let's calculate the daily calorie deficit needed:
105,000 calories / 308 days ≈ 340 calories/day

So, Andy needs to create a calorie deficit of approximately 340 calories per day to reach his goal of losing 30 lbs by his birthday."
"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate how much he earned in a week and subtract the amount he spent.

Gerald earns $30 per day. There are 7 days in a week, so he earns 30 * 7 = $210 in a week.

He spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount spent from the amount earned: 210 - 100 = $110.

Gerald has $110 left."
"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs, we need to multiply the amount of water she needs per kilometer by the number of kilometers she will run.

She needs 60 ml of water per kilometer, and she will run 8 laps, each lap being 0.25 km. 

First, we need to find out the total distance she will run. Since each lap is 0.25 km, 8 laps will be 8 * 0.25 = 2 km.

Now, we multiply the total distance by the amount of water she needs per kilometer: 2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml.

Hannah will need 120 ml of water."
"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on clothes: 
20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount:
$500 - $100 = $400

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on CDs:
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount:
$400 - $100 = $300

So, Julie had $300 left.

"To find the cost of the house, we need to divide the total cost by 4, since the house costs three times as much as the lot. 

Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x. The total cost is the sum of the cost of the house and the cost of the lot, which is x + 3x = 4x. 

Given that the total cost is $120,000, we can set up the equation 4x = 120,000. Solving for x, we get x = 120,000 / 4 = 30,000. 

Since the cost of the house is 3x, the cost of the house is 3 * 30,000 = 90,000.

The final answer is 90,000."

"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to first determine how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can calculate Josh's cookies as follows:

Josh's cookies = Suzanne's cookies / 4
Josh's cookies = 36 / 4
Josh's cookies = 9

Since Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

The final answer is 18."
"To find the total amount of money Ali has initially, we need to calculate the sum of the money from the $10 bills and the $20 bills.

Ali has 4 $10 bills, which is 4 * $10 = $40.
Ali has 6 $20 bills, which is 6 * $20 = $120.

The total amount of money Ali has initially is $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives half of the total money to his sister, which is $160 / 2 = $80.

The remaining amount of money after giving half to his sister is $160 - $80 = $80.

Then, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. 3/5 of $80 is (3/5) * $80 = $48.

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

"To solve this problem, we need to first convert the time taken by Rob from hours to minutes. 

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Rob takes 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time taken by Rob. 

So, we need to find double the time taken by Rob, which is 2 * 120 minutes = 240 minutes.

Now, we add 40 minutes to this, which gives us 240 minutes + 40 minutes = 280 minutes.

Therefore, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the rate at which one person paints the house. Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can calculate the rate as follows:

Rate = 1/2 house / 5 days = 1/10 house per day

Now, if 5 people are working together, their combined rate would be 5 times the individual rate:

Combined rate = 5 * (1/10) = 1/2 house per day

Since they need to paint a whole house, we can calculate the time required as follows:

Time = 1 house / (1/2 house per day) = 2 days

To convert this to hours, we multiply the number of days by 24:

Time (in hours) = 2 days * 24 hours/day = 48 hours

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of chairs Ophelia has. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, and Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can set up an equation to represent the relationship between the number of chairs and sofas.

Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as 'x'. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna has 3x chairs. We are also given that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so Ophelia has x - 2 sofas.

We know Ophelia has 20 sofas, so we can set up the equation:

x - 2 = 20

Solving for x, we get:

x = 22

Now that we know Ophelia has 22 chairs, we can find the number of chairs Jenna has:

Jenna has 3x = 3(22) = 66 chairs

To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we add the number of sofas and chairs:

Total = 20 (sofas) + 22 (chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs) = 108

The total number of sofas and chairs is 108."
"To find out how many CDs Tom could have bought if he hadn't purchased the headphone set, we need to subtract the cost of the headphone set from the total amount he paid.

First, we need to find the cost of the headphone set. We know that Tom paid $48 in total and $4 for the CD. 

Cost of headphone set = Total amount paid - Cost of CD
Cost of headphone set = $48 - $4
Cost of headphone set = $44

Now, we can find out how many CDs Tom could have bought if he hadn't purchased the headphone set.

Number of CDs = Total amount paid / Cost of one CD
Number of CDs = $48 / $4
Number of CDs = 12

If Tom hadn't bought the headphone set, he could have bought 12 more CDs.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events step by step.

Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 48 - 8 = 40.

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get on the bus. So, 5 * 8 = 40 people get on the bus. Now, the total number of passengers is 40 + 40 = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 80 - 21 = 59.

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus. Since 3 times fewer means 1/3 of the number who got off, 21 / 3 = 7 passengers get on the bus. Now, the total number of passengers is 59 + 7 = 66.

Therefore, there are 66 passengers riding the bus after the second stop.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jame's current age be x.

In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5) + 5 = x + 10 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. 

So, we can set up the equation: 
x + 10 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation:
x + 10 = 2x + 5 - 5
x + 10 = 2x
10 = x

Now that we know Jame's current age is 10, we can find the age of his cousin. 
In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 10 + 8 = 18 years old.

The age difference between Jame and his cousin is 18 - 10 = 8 years.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we need to first find the cost of the printer. 

Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. 

The total cost of all items is $2,400. To find the cost of the monitors, we subtract the cost of the computer and printer from the total cost: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

Since there are 2 monitors, the cost of one monitor is $600 / 2 = $300.

"To calculate the total amount you paid, first, find 20% of the $50 bill. 

20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10

Now, add the 20% tip to the original bill.

$50 (bill) + $10 (tip) = $60

So, you ended up paying $60."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy adds $5 to his share, making it $6 + $5 = $11. The next day, he adds another $10, making his total $11 + $10 = $21.

He then spends $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

He then triples the amount he has left, which is $13 * 3 = $39.

So, the eldest boy now has $39.

39"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know Elvis has a monthly target of $1125. Since there are 30 days in April, we can divide the target by 30 to find the daily savings needed for the first half of the month.

Daily savings for the first half of the month = $1125 / 15 (15 days in the first half of April) = $75

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, we can multiply the daily savings for the first half by 2.

Daily savings for the second half of the month = $75 * 2 = $150

Therefore, Elvis needs to save $150 per day in the second half of the month to hit his target."
"To find the total cost of the items Verna bought, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of three apples is 3 * $1.50 = $4.50.
The cost of five oranges is 5 * $0.80 = $4.00.
The cost of six peaches is 6 * $0.75 = $4.50.

The total cost of the items is $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00.

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is $20 - $13.00 = $7.00."
"To find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, we need to calculate their earnings first. 

Jairus earns $0.8 per task, so for 20 tasks, he earns 20 * 0.8 = $16.

Jenny earns $0.5 per task, so for 20 tasks, she earns 20 * 0.5 = $10.

The difference in their earnings is $16 - $10 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's say Brad gets x dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars. 

We know that the total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars. 

4x = 4 * 20
4x = 80

So, Jeff gets 80 dollars."
"To find the total miles Jeff walks, we need to calculate the distance he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

Since Jeff walks to work and back, the total distance he walks each day is 2 times the distance to his work. 

Distance to work = 3 miles
Total distance walked each day = 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles

Since Jeff works 5 times a week, the total miles he walks in a week is:
Total miles walked in a week = 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, which means she writes 26 letters twice, so that's 2 * 26 = 52 letters.

2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once, which is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.

3. Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written, which includes the full alphabet (52 letters) and the half alphabet (13 letters), so that's 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

Therefore, Elise has written a total of 65 letters.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the phone tree. 

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. 

In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families notified.

In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families notified.

In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 27 * 3 = 81 new families notified.

So, the total number of families notified in the fourth round is 81.

Total weight lost = 30 pounds

Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 + 30
Initial weight = 100 pounds"
"To find the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we need to first determine the total number of toys he needs to have a play set five times larger than James's play set. 

Since James's play set has 80 toys, a set five times larger would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys. 

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than this, so he needs 400 + 2 = 402 toys. 

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 402 - 2 = 400 toys.

402"
"To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The cost of 5 notebooks is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50
The cost of 2 pens is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
The cost of 1 calculator is $12
The cost of 1 geometry set is $10

The total cost of all the items is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $20

To apply the 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of the total cost, which is 0.10 * $20 = $2

The total cost after the discount is $20 - $2 = $18

Daniel has to spend $18 on all the items he wants to buy."
"To find the total cost of the items, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of hamburgers: 5 hamburgers * $4 each = $20
The cost of potato fries: 10 packs * $0.30 each pack = $3
The cost of fruit drinks: 5 cans * $2 each can = $10

Total cost = $20 + $3 + $10 = $33

Carly pays with a $50 bill. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the $50 bill.

"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down the sales into two parts: the amount below $1000 and the amount above $1000.

For the amount below $1000, the commission is 30% of $1000, which is 0.3 * $1000 = $300.

For the amount above $1000, the commission is 10% of $1500 ($2500 - $1000), which is 0.1 * $1500 = $150.

Now, we add the commissions from both parts: $300 + $150 = $450.

Therefore, Antonella earned $450.

$450"
"To determine the total number of water bottles Bill needs, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles he already has. 

Since Bill has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each, the total number of bottles he has is 2 * 24 = 48.

Since Bill wants 2 bottles of water for each of his 70 guests, the total number of bottles he needs is 70 * 2 = 140.

To find out how many additional bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs: 140 - 48 = 92.

Therefore, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water for his party.

92"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on both a cold day and a hot day.

On a cold day, Ray swims 1 mile in 16 minutes. To find the time it takes to swim 3 miles, we multiply the time for 1 mile by 3:

Time for 3 miles on a cold day = 16 minutes * 3 = 48 minutes

On a hot day, Ray swims 1 mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. First, we find the time for 1 mile on a hot day:

Time for 1 mile on a hot day = 2 * 16 minutes + 2 minutes = 34 minutes

Now, we multiply the time for 1 mile on a hot day by 3 to find the time for 3 miles:

Time for 3 miles on a hot day = 34 minutes * 3 = 102 minutes

To find the difference in time between a hot day and a cold day, we subtract the time for 3 miles on a cold day from the time for 3 miles on a hot day:

Difference in time = Time for 3 miles on a hot day - Time for 3 miles on a cold day
= 102 minutes - 48 minutes
= 54 minutes

"To find the total number of holes, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the number of holes in the buttons with four holes.

There are 7 buttons with two holes, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 * 2 = 14.

The rest of the buttons are 21 - 7 = 14 buttons with four holes. The total number of holes in these buttons is 14 * 4 = 56.

Now, we add the total number of holes in both types of buttons: 14 + 56 = 70.

The total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 70.

"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can calculate it by dividing Timothy's locker size by 2.

Zack's locker size = Timothy's locker size / 2
Zack's locker size = 24 / 2
Zack's locker size = 12 cubic inches

Now, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To find Peter's locker size, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 1/4.

Peter's locker size = Zack's locker size * 1/4
Peter's locker size = 12 * 1/4
Peter's locker size = 3 cubic inches

The final answer is 3."
"To find out how many cups Juan drinks, we need to first determine how many cups Octavia drinks. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, and Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his intake to 4 cups, we can set up an equation.

Let's denote the number of cups Octavia drinks as x. Then, Juan drinks 10x cups. Since Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his intake to 4 cups, we can set up the equation:

10x = 4

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 10:

x = 4/10
x = 0.4

So, Octavia drinks 0.4 cups of coffee. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, Juan drinks 10 * 0.4 = 4 cups.

To find out how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we subtract the recommended amount from the amount he currently drinks:

4 - 4 = 0

Juan does not need to reduce his daily coffee intake."
"To find the total number of rodents, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

Number of hamsters = 3 cages * 10 hamsters per cage = 30 hamsters
Number of guinea pigs = 3 cages * 5 guinea pigs per cage = 15 guinea pigs

Total number of rodents = Number of hamsters + Number of guinea pigs
= 30 + 15
= 45

The pet shop had 45 rodents in total."
"To find the average weight of the three friends, we need to first find their individual weights.

Mark weighs 150 pounds.
Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.
Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we can find the average weight by adding their weights and dividing by 3:

Average weight = (Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight) / 3
= (150 + 130 + 260) / 3
= 540 / 3
= 180

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the change in the angle of the sun relative to the ground. 

The initial angle of the sun is 32 degrees. Since the sun is moving upward, we need to subtract the angle from the initial angle to get the new angle. 

The sun moves 5 degrees per hour. In 10 hours, it will move 5 * 10 = 50 degrees.

New angle = Initial angle - Change in angle
New angle = 32 - 50
New angle = -18 degrees

Since the angle cannot be negative, we need to add 360 to get the equivalent positive angle.

New angle = -18 + 360
New angle = 342 degrees

The final answer is 342."
"To find out how many candles James needs, we first need to determine the age of his younger son. 

Since the older son is 12 years old and the younger son is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Since the older son is 12 years old, James will need 12 candles for him. The younger son is 8 years old, so he will need 8 candles. 

In total, James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles. 

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we can divide the total number of candles needed by 5 to find out how many packs James needs to buy. 

20 candles / 5 candles per pack = 4 packs

Since each pack costs $3, we can multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack to find the total cost.

4 packs * $3 per pack = $12

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she spent reading in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, she spent a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes reading in the first week.

Now, we know that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she read in the first week, we can divide the total minutes she spent reading (105) by 1.5 minutes per page, and then multiply by 2 pages per 1.5 minutes.

105 / 1.5 = 70
70 * 2 = 140 pages

So, Judy read 140 pages in the first week.

To find out how many pages she read in two weeks, we can add the pages she read in the first week (140) to the pages she read in the second week (100).

140 + 100 = 240 pages

1/4 of 12 is 3.

The total number of sandwiches eaten is 4 + 3 = 7.

To find the number of sandwiches left, we subtract the total eaten from the initial amount: 
12 - 7 = 5.

There are 5 sandwiches left."
"To solve this problem, let's denote Shiloh's current age as S and his nephew's current age as N. 

We are given that Shiloh is 44 years old today, so S = 44.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be S + 7, and his nephew's age will be N + 7. According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This can be written as:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44 into the equation:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

10 = N

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to break down the process step by step.

1. The tooth fairy left $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth were worth $1.00 each, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. So, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon: 
$5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To find the number of goals scored by each teenager, we can use the information given. 

Let's denote the number of goals scored by Anna as A, the number of goals scored by Mark as M, and the number of goals scored by Richie as R. 

We know that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, so we can write an equation: 
R = M + 20

We also know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, so we can write another equation:
R = A + 45

Since we know Richie scored 80 goals, we can substitute R = 80 into the first equation:
80 = M + 20
M = 80 - 20
M = 60

Now that we know Mark scored 60 goals, we can substitute M = 60 into the second equation:
80 = A + 45
A = 80 - 45
A = 35

Now that we know Anna scored 35 goals, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:
Total goals = A + M + R
Total goals = 35 + 60 + 80
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: 175"

"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how much he spent on wooden action figures and plastic action figures separately.

From Sunday to Wednesday, Peter spent $5 each day, so he spent a total of $5 * 3 = $15 on wooden action figures.

Since Peter has $70, he has $70 - $15 = $55 left for the rest of the week.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. So, he can buy $55 / $2 = 27.5 plastic action figures. Since we can't buy half a figure, we'll round down to 27 plastic action figures.

In total, Peter will have 3 wooden action figures and 27 plastic action figures by the end of the week.

Total action figures = 3 + 27 = 30"

The total cost of the kitten so far is $308."
"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses required by the shops per month and subtract the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses required by the shops per week:
20 (first shop) + 15 (second shop) + 30 (third shop) = 65 roses per week

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly demand by 4:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Now, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows from the total number of roses required:
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month

Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To find the amount of money remaining in Katina's account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes from the account in that time period.

Since Katina removes $100 from the account every month, we can calculate the total amount removed in 2 years as follows:

$100/month * 12 months/year = $1200/year
$1200/year * 2 years = $2400

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the account:

"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

Total revenue = Number of sandwiches sold * Price per sandwich
Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00 per sandwich
Total revenue = $70.00

Total cost = Cost of bread per loaf * Number of loaves used + Cost of cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches
Since each loaf makes 10 sandwiches, the number of loaves used is equal to the number of sandwiches sold, which is 10.
Total cost = $3.00 per loaf * 10 loaves + $30.00
Total cost = $30.00 + $30.00
Total cost = $60.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $60.00
Net profit = $10.00"

Since Judy bought a dozen (12) cups, and she brought twice as many dishes as cups, she brought 12 * 2 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups is 12 (Judy) + 40 (friend) = 52 cups.

The total number of dishes is 24 (Judy) + 44 (friend) = 68 dishes.

The total number of utensils is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120.

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to first find the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts. 

Since each box is $100.00 and there's a 10% discount, the discounted price of one box is:
$100.00 * (1 - 0.10) = $90.00

The total cost of 2 boxes is:
$90.00 * 2 = $180.00

Since there are 90 contacts in 2 boxes, the cost of each pair of contacts is:
$180.00 / 90 = $2.00

The final answer is $2.00."
"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate their individual hours worked and multiply it by the hourly wage.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.
John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.
John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.
John's total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours.
Jill's total hours worked is 3 hours.
John's earnings are 7 * $10 = $70.
Jill's earnings are 3 * $10 = $30.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is $40."
"To find out how many calories Hannah burns in total, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running separately and then add them together.

Calories burned from aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
Calories burned from running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories
Total calories burned: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we can divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times she needs to drink 100 ml of water.

Total calories burned / 200 = 1600 / 200 = 8
Since she needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she needs 8 * 100 ml of water.

8 * 100 = 800 ml

The final answer is: 800"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We are given that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation:

B + R + G = 4500

We are also given that the jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so we can write the equation:

R = 0.99B

We are also given that the jar contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so we can write the equation:

G = 1.01B

Substituting the expressions for R and G into the first equation, we get:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 1500

Now that we have the value of B, we can find the values of R and G:

R = 0.99B = 0.99(1500) = 1485

G = 1.01B = 1.01(1500) = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, subtract R from G:

1509 - 1485 = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to first find the third measurement. 

Jared's initial speed is 47 WPM. He increases it by 5 words to get 52 WPM. To find the next increase, we subtract the initial speed from the second speed: 52 - 47 = 5. 

Now, we add this increase to the second speed to get the third speed: 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

The three measurements are 47, 52, and 57. To find the average, we add these numbers together and divide by 3: 

(47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52.

The average of the three measurements is 52."
"To find the difference in weight after 5 weeks, we need to calculate the weight gained or lost in each scenario.

If Martin eats Cheerios every day, he loses 1.25 pounds/week. After 5 weeks, he will lose 5 * 1.25 = 6.25 pounds.

If Martin eats donuts every day, he gains 1.75 pounds/week. After 5 weeks, he will gain 5 * 1.75 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight after 5 weeks is 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

"To determine the total number of people attending the event, we need to calculate the number of people invited by Alex and her friends.

Alex initially invites 100 people. Each of these people invites 2 friends, so the total number of additional guests is 100 * 2 = 200.

Then, Alex invites 10 friends, and 8 of them bring their spouses. This adds 10 + 8 = 18 more people.

Now, we add the initial 100 people, the 200 additional guests, and the 18 additional people invited by Alex's friends and their spouses. 

Total number of people = 100 + 200 + 18 = 318

Alex will need 318 seats for the event."
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to calculate the weights of the other dogs first.

The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"To find the total cost of the boots on eBay, we need to add the cost of the boots and the shipping cost. 

The cost of the boots on eBay is $13. The shipping cost is twice as much as on Amazon, so it is 2 * $4 = $8. 

The total cost of the boots on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to subtract the cost of the boots on Amazon from the cost of the boots on eBay. 

$21 - $16 = $5.

The boots are $5 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, which is 20 feet off the ground. 

The beanstalk starts out 4 feet tall and doubles its height every day. 

Day 1: 4 feet * 2 = 8 feet
Day 2: 8 feet * 2 = 16 feet
Day 3: 16 feet * 2 = 32 feet

On the third day, the beanstalk is taller than Mark's window (20 feet). 

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first calculate the grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day and each cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams, we can calculate the grams of protein per day as follows:

200 grams of mushrooms / 100 grams of mushrooms per cup = 2 cups of mushrooms per day
Since each cup of mushrooms has 3 grams of protein, we can multiply the number of cups by the grams of protein per cup:
2 cups * 3 grams of protein per cup = 6 grams of protein per day

To find the total grams of protein per week, we multiply the daily amount by 7:
6 grams of protein per day * 7 days per week = 42 grams of protein per week

"To solve this problem, let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. 

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation: x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides, we get: 0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get: 10 = x

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 10 + 3 = 13

The final answer is 13."
"To determine how many hours George needs to work, we need to calculate the total cost of the dental work and subtract the deposit he's already paid.

The base price of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000.
The additional cost for the porcelain crown is $500.
The total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already paid a deposit of $600.
The remaining amount George needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we can calculate the number of hours he needs to work by dividing the remaining amount by his hourly wage:

$3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

Therefore, George needs to work for 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work.

"To solve this problem, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Let's denote the smallest angle as x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, its measure is 2x. 

Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, its measure is 3x.

The sum of the three angles is 180 degrees, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees

3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle is 90 degrees.

"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents.

He has 8 quarters, which is 8 * 25 = 200 cents.
He has 6 dimes, which is 6 * 10 = 60 cents.
He has 14 nickels, which is 14 * 5 = 70 cents.
He has 15 pennies, which is 15 * 1 = 15 cents.

Adding these amounts together, we get 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents.

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by 5 to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy: 345 / 5 = 69.

Therefore, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and then add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

The total number of legs in the store is 48."
"To find the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds. 

50% of 8 pounds = 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds

So, the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50% is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

Since Jamaal uses a weight two pounds lighter than the increased weight, we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds.

12 - 2 = 10 pounds

The weight Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds."
"To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he buys each year and add the 5 games he gets for Christmas.

Year 1: 
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 1 * 12 = 12 games.
- He gets 5 games for Christmas, so 12 + 5 = 17 games.

Year 2: 
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 1 * 12 = 12 games.
- He gets 5 games for Christmas, so 12 + 5 = 17 games.

Year 3: 
- He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so 2 * 12 = 24 games.
- He gets 5 games for Christmas, so 24 + 5 = 29 games.

Now, let's add the total number of games Steve has after 3 years: 
17 (Year 1) + 17 (Year 2) + 29 (Year 3) = 63 games.

The final answer is 63."
"To find the rate of the plane, we can divide the distance traveled (1200 miles) by the time taken (3 hours). 

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we can use the rate to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it would take the plane 5 additional hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the amount of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to calculate 3/4 of the amount Ruiz makes in two hours. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so in 1 hour, he makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds. 

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds as Ruiz in an hour, so she makes 3/4 * 60 = 45 pounds in an hour.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of chocolates they make in 12 hours. 

Ruiz makes 60 pounds in 1 hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds. 

Marissa makes 45 pounds in 1 hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they make together in 12 hours is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

"To find out how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate his total expenses and subtract that from his original amount of money.

On Monday, Howard spent $8.

On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, so he spent 2 * $8 = $16.

On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, so he spent 4 * $16 = $64.

Total expenses = $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

Howard originally had $100. 

To find out how much money he has left, we subtract his total expenses from his original amount: $100 - $88 = $12.

"To find out how many rotations the tire will undergo in a year, we need to first find out how many rotations it undergoes in a month. 

Since the car drives 400 miles a month and the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, we can calculate the number of rotations per mile as follows:

725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile

Now, we can find the total number of rotations in a month:

362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles = 145,000 rotations per month

To find the total number of rotations in a year, we multiply the monthly rotations by 12:

145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations/year

Now, we can divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the number of rotations it undergoes in a year to find out how many years it will last:

10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years

The tire will need to be replaced in 6 years."
"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of washings per pump. 

The shampoo gives 120 washings per 2 pumps, so the number of washings per pump is 120 / 2 = 60.

Since Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the total number of washings per pump is 60.

The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00, which is equivalent to 2400 cents.

To find the cost of each pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of washings per pump: 2400 cents / 60 = 40 cents per pump.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total cost of the outfit, we need to calculate the discount first. 

The original price of the shirt is $25, and there's a 30% discount. 

Discount = 30% of $25 = 0.3 * $25 = $7.50

The discounted price of the shirt is $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

The total cost of the outfit is the sum of the discounted price of the shirt and the price of the shorts: $17.50 + $35 = $52.50

Since sales tax is included, we need to add the sales tax to the total cost. However, the problem doesn't specify the sales tax rate. Assuming a standard sales tax rate of 8% (which is common in many places), we can calculate the sales tax as follows:

Sales tax = 8% of $52.50 = 0.08 * $52.50 = $4.20

The total cost of the outfit, including sales tax, is $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70

Joe started with $50, so he will have $50 - $56.70 = -$6.70 left after the purchase."
"To determine the amount of butter needed, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants Juan wants to make in a week. 

Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day, and there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 4 dozen by 7 days:

4 dozen * 7 days = 28 dozen croissants

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can convert 28 dozen to a total number of croissants:

28 dozen * 12 = 336 croissants

Now, we know that it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find the total amount of butter needed, we multiply the number of croissants by the amount of butter needed per dozen:

336 croissants * 1/4 pound/croissant = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

Therefore, Juan will need 84 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months.

For the first 5 months, John received $100,000 per month. So, the total cost for these months is:

5 months * $100,000/month = $500,000

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the funding for the 6th month is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000, for the 7th month it's $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000, and so on.

The funding for the remaining 5 months is as follows:
- Month 6: $150,000
- Month 7: $225,000
- Month 8: $337,500
- Month 9: $506,250

Total posts = Number of members * Posts per day * Number of days in March
Total posts = 1000 * 3 * 31
Total posts = 93,000

The total number of posts in the group in March is 93,000."
"To calculate the total amount Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to first calculate the total gallons of water used per week, then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

Gary does laundry twice a week, and each load uses 20 gallons of water. So, the total gallons of water used per week is 2 * 20 = 40 gallons.

There are 52 weeks in a year. Therefore, the total gallons of water used in a year is 40 * 52 = 2080 gallons.

A gallon of water costs $0.15. So, the total cost of water for laundry in a year is 2080 * $0.15 = $312.

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators, so the number of occupied seats by administrators is:
72 seats * 1/4 = 18 seats

The remaining seats are:
72 seats - 18 seats = 54 seats

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents, so the number of occupied seats by parents is:
54 seats * 1/3 = 18 seats

The remaining seats are occupied by students:
54 seats - 18 seats = 36 seats

Therefore, there were 36 students in the school auditorium.

"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he chews throughout the day.

Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

On the way home from school, he chews 1 piece of gum. 

After dinner, he chews 1 piece of gum.

So, in total, Jim chews 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces of gum throughout the day.

Initially, Jim had 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

When he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, he gives away 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.

Therefore, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb per second to Mb per second. 

Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can divide her speed by 1000 to get her speed in Mb per second: 
20 kb/second / 1000 = 0.02 Mb/second

Now, we need to convert her speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour. 
Multiply her speed in Mb per second by 3600 to get her speed in Mb per hour: 
0.02 Mb/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 72 Mb/hour

The final answer is 72."
"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days separately.

On the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed on these days is:
10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

On the remaining days (4 days), the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed on these days is:
6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Now, we add the total number of cars towed on both sets of days:
30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

The total number of cars towed that week is 54."
"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to subtract his current height from the required height and then divide by his annual growth rate.

First, convert Adam's current height from inches to feet: 40 inches / 12 inches per foot = 3.33 feet.

Now, subtract his current height from the required height: 4 feet - 3.33 feet = 0.67 feet.

Since he grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this to feet: 2 inches / 12 inches per foot = 0.17 feet per year.

Now, divide the difference in height by his annual growth rate: 0.67 feet / 0.17 feet per year = 3.94 years.

So, it will take approximately 4 years for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To find James' earnings, we need to calculate the profit first. 

The cost of the cars is $25,000 each, and the company paid 30% of that price. So, the amount paid by the company is 30% of $25,000, which is 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500 per car.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total amount paid by the company is 10 * $7,500 = $75,000.

The profit is the amount received by James after deducting the cost from the total amount paid by the company. So, the profit is $75,000 - $250,000 (10 cars * $25,000) = $50,000.

James got a 10% commission on the profits. So, his commission is 10% of $50,000, which is 0.1 * $50,000 = $5,000.

Therefore, James made $5,000."
"To find the number of riders who can stay upright on the wave, we first need to find the total number of riders who can stay upright. 

Given that 25% of the riders can stay upright when the wave is over 30 feet, and there are 100 riders, we can calculate the number of riders who can stay upright as follows:

25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders

Since 60% of these riders are women, we can find the number of women who can stay upright by multiplying 25 by 0.6:

25 * 0.6 = 15 women

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

25 - 15 = 10 men

The final answer is 10."
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to first find the prices of the gold and silver jewels.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can find the price of the gold jewel. Since the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate it as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

Now, we know that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold. So, we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we have the prices of all three jewels: diamond ($2000), gold ($1600), and silver ($1200). To find the total price, we add the prices of all three jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond + Price of gold + Price of silver
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The total price for all three jewels is $4800."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of each type of stamp Max bought. 

Let's denote the number of snowflake stamps as S, the number of truck stamps as T, and the number of rose stamps as R.

We know that S = 16.

We also know that T = S + 3, and R = T - 9.

Substituting S = 16 into the equation for T, we get T = 16 + 3 = 19.

Substituting T = 19 into the equation for R, we get R = 19 - 9 = 10.

Now, we can find the total number of stamps by adding S, T, and R: Total = S + T + R = 16 + 19 + 10 = 45.

The final answer is 45."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the relative speed between Bob and Tom. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed to get the relative speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph
Relative speed = -15 mph

However, since speed cannot be negative, we take the absolute value of the relative speed.

Relative speed = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Relative speed

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate Darren's catch as follows:

Naomi's catch - 6 = Darren's catch
17 - 6 = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can find out how many fish Tommy caught. Since Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, we can calculate Tommy's catch as follows:

Darren's catch + 3 = Tommy's catch
11 + 3 = 14

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish.

"To determine the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the total cost of the classes and then subtract the cost per class from it.

The total cost of the classes is $60. 

Since the cost per class is $10, we can divide the total cost by the cost per class to find the maximum number of classes his parents will allow him to take.

$60 ÷ $10 = 6 classes

This means that Manny's parents will allow him to take 6 classes. 

Since there are 10 total classes, Manny can miss 10 - 6 = 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

"To find the total weekly production, we need to first find the daily production of Julie and Jewel. 

Since Julie operates the cash register twice as fast as Jewel, Julie's daily production is 2 times Jewel's daily production. 

Jewel's daily production is 50 customers. 
So, Julie's daily production is 2 * 50 = 100 customers.

The total daily production for both of them is 50 + 100 = 150 customers.

Since they work all 7 days of the week, the total weekly production is 150 * 7 = 1050 customers.

1050"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

We know that Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

We also know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, Lynn ran 20 - 3 = 17 miles.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the cost of 5 apples, we need to multiply the cost of one apple by 5. 

Cost of one apple = $5.20 / 4 = $1.30
Cost of 5 apples = $1.30 * 5 = $6.50

To find the cost of 5 oranges, we need to multiply the cost of one orange by 5.

Cost of one orange = $3.30 / 3 = $1.10
Cost of 5 oranges = $1.10 * 5 = $5.50

Now, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to find the total cost.

Total cost = $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we multiply the volume by 3 to find the total time.

Total time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Total time = 72 * 3
Total time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole."
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price of the truck.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade is $7,500.

Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, we add the cost of each feature to the base price of the truck:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000
$42,000 + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To calculate Tim's new monthly salary, we need to first calculate the raise amount and the bonus amount.

The raise amount is 5% of his current salary: 
$20000 * 0.05 = $1000

The bonus amount is half a month's salary: 
$20000 / 12 = $1666.67

Now, we add the raise and bonus to his current salary to get his new monthly salary:
$20000 + $1000 + $1666.67 = $22666.67

To calculate his yearly salary, we multiply his new monthly salary by 12:
$22666.67 * 12 = $272000

The final answer is: $272000"

The total cost of everything is $9,600."
"To find the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to calculate the total number of articles published by each website and then add them together.

The news website publishes 20 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. So, the total number of articles published by the news website in February is:

20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles

The sister company publishes 10 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. So, the total number of articles published by the sister company in February is:

10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles

Now, we add the total number of articles published by both websites:

560 articles + 280 articles = 840 articles

The total number of articles published by both websites in February is 840."
"To find the age of Steve's son's wife, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Steve is 60 years old.
2. His wife is 4 years older than him, so his wife is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.
3. Their son is half as old as his mom, so the son is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.
4. Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so the son's wife is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

The final answer is 29."
"To find the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we need to multiply the number of portions in one bag by the number of bags.

Since each bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, the total amount of flour in one bag is 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms.

Now, we multiply this by the number of bags: 16 * 3 = 48 kilograms.

The final answer is 48."
"To find the total distance covered by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance covered by each of them separately and then add them together.

Alisa biked at 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours, so the distance covered by Alisa is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 12 miles/hour * 4.5 hours
Distance = 54 miles

Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours, so the distance covered by Stanley is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 2.5 hours
Distance = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances covered by Alisa and Stanley to find the total distance:
Total Distance = Distance covered by Alisa + Distance covered by Stanley
Total Distance = 54 miles + 25 miles
Total Distance = 79 miles

The total distance covered by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"To find the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay.

Time to dig through soil = Total soil depth / Rate of digging through soil
Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours

Time to dig through clay = Total clay depth / Rate of digging through clay
Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / (1/2) feet/hour = 8 * 2 = 16 hours

Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 16 hours = 22 hours

The total time it will take Bill to dig the well is 22 hours."
"To find the total number of cupcakes Howie needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of people, including himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates.

Total number of people = 1 (Howie) + 1 (teacher) + 25 (classmates) = 27

Since Howie wants to get 2 cupcakes for each person, we multiply the total number of people by 2.

Total cupcakes needed = 27 * 2 = 54

So, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes.

"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on both days.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got $2 off. So, the total cost on Tuesday is:
20 * $20 - $2 = $398

On Wednesday, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each, but the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. The total cost before the discount is:
20 * $30 = $600
The discount amount is 10% of $600, which is:
$600 * 0.1 = $60
The total cost after the discount is:
$600 - $60 = $540

Now, we can find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days:
$398 - $540 = -$142

However, since the question asks for the difference, and the result is negative, it means that Clara paid less than Sheila. The absolute difference is $142.

The final answer is 142."
"To find the total amount Ariadne made in the first month, we need to determine the sales of green hats. 

Let's denote the sales of green hats as G. Since the sales of red hats were half the total amount of green hats, we can set up the equation:

400 = 0.5G

To find G, we multiply both sides by 2:

G = 400 * 2
G = 800

So, the sales of green hats in the first month were $800.

Now, we need to find the total sales for the first month. The total sales for the first month is the sum of the sales of red and green hats:

Total sales for the first month = 400 + 800
Total sales for the first month = 1200

In the second month, the sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. 

Total sales for the second month = 3/4 * 1200
Total sales for the second month = 900

Now, we can find the total amount Ariadne made in two months by adding the sales of both months:

Total sales in two months = 1200 + 900
Total sales in two months = 2100"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of paid hours and multiply it by the cost per hour.

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so the number of paid hours is 4 - 1 = 3 hours.

The cost of the first paid hour is $15. Each hour after that is twice the cost, so the cost of the remaining 2 hours is 2 * $15 = $30. 

The total cost is $15 + $30 = $45.

"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to subtract the amount she has in her bank account from her expected wage.

Expected wage: $300
Current bank balance: $420

Withheld amount = Expected wage - Current bank balance
Withheld amount = $300 - $420
Withheld amount = -$120

Since the withheld amount cannot be negative, we need to consider the initial deposit and the current balance. 

Initial deposit: $200
Current balance: $420

Total amount in the account = Initial deposit + Current balance
Total amount in the account = $200 + $420
Total amount in the account = $620

Since Sally's expected wage is $300, the amount withheld from her wage is the difference between the total amount in the account and her expected wage.

Withheld amount = Total amount in the account - Expected wage
Withheld amount = $620 - $300
Withheld amount = $320

Therefore, $320 was withheld from Sally's wage."
"To determine the number of eggs needed, we first need to calculate the total number of deviled egg halves required. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves and there are 16 guests, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is 3 * 16 = 48.

Since each egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2 to get the total number of eggs required. 48 / 2 = 24.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can convert 24 eggs to dozens by dividing by 12. 24 / 12 = 2.

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs for her party.

Therefore, Mike will finish the book 10 days before the deadline."
"To find the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the cost of the plane itself, the monthly rent, and the monthly fuel cost, and then add them together.

The cost of the plane itself is $150,000.

The monthly rent is $5000.

The monthly fuel cost is twice the monthly rent, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000.

The total monthly cost is $5000 (rent) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000.

To find the total cost for the first year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:

$15,000 * 12 = $180,000.

The total cost of the plane for the first year is $150,000 (plane cost) + $180,000 (total monthly cost) = $330,000.

"To solve this problem, we can start by identifying the given information:

- It took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice.
- It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice.
- Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.

Let's denote the cooking time for pork as P and the cooking time for beans as B. We know that P = 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

Since beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, we can write the equation: B = (P + R) / 2, where R is the cooking time for rice.

Substituting the value of P, we get: B = (50 + 30) / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we need to find the total cooking time for all three items. The total time is the sum of the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans: Total time = R + P + B = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we can use the fact that sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. We know that the total number of animal heads is 20, so we can write the equation:

s + g = 20

We also know that the total number of animal legs is 70, so we can write another equation:

4s + 2g = 70

We can simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 2:

2s + g = 35

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for 's' by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

(2s + g) - (s + g) = 35 - 20
s = 15

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the coffee. Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee and uses 1 pound per day, he needs 7 pounds of coffee. 

The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but the more expensive brand costs 20% more. To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we need to calculate 20% of $5 and add it to $5. 

20% of $5 is 0.2 * $5 = $1. 
The cost of the more expensive brand is $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Since Roger needs 7 pounds of coffee, the total cost of the coffee is 7 * $6 = $42.

Adding the cost of the coffee and the donut, the total cost is $42 + $2 = $44.

The number of newspapers James delivers to District B is 193."
"To find the total number of recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total class time and then divide it by the time it takes to learn a new recipe.

Total class time = Number of classes * Class duration
Total class time = 4 classes/week * 2 hours/class
Total class time = 8 hours/week

Since the class meets for 6 weeks, we multiply the total class time by the number of weeks:
Total class time = 8 hours/week * 6 weeks
Total class time = 48 hours

Now, we divide the total class time by the time it takes to learn a new recipe:
Number of recipes = Total class time / Time to learn a new recipe
Number of recipes = 48 hours / 1.5 hours/recipe

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money each person has. 

We know that Aurelia has $120. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * Aurelia's money
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * $120
Kassidy's money = $90

We also know that Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's money as follows:
Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + $60
Rayna's money = $90 + $60
Rayna's money = $150

Now, we need to find the total amount of money they have together. 
Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
Total money = $120 + $90 + $150
Total money = $360

If they decide to share the money equally among themselves, we can divide the total money by 3.
Money per person = Total money / 3
Money per person = $360 / 3
Money per person = $120

The final answer is: $120"
"To find the total length of the game, we need to calculate the total time of the 4 regular quarters and add the additional 5 minutes for the extended quarter.

Each quarter is 12 minutes long, so 4 quarters would be 4 x 12 = 48 minutes. 

Adding the 5 minutes for the extended quarter, the total game length is 48 + 5 = 53 minutes.

"To find the number of employees who oversee the company, we need to calculate the percentage of employees who are both management and oversee the company.

First, we find the percentage of employees who are management: 20% of 50 employees = 0.20 * 50 = 10 employees.

Then, we find the percentage of management employees who oversee the company: 30% of 10 employees = 0.30 * 10 = 3 employees.

Therefore, there are 3 employees who oversee the company.

"To find the total amount of dry ingredients needed for 16 muffins, we need to multiply the amount of each ingredient by 16.

For flour: 5 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 80 tablespoons
For sugar: 3 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 48 tablespoons
For salt: 0.25 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 4 tablespoons

The total amount of dry ingredients needed is 80 + 48 + 4 = 132 tablespoons.

"To find the total amount of candy, we need to add the amount of candy each person had. 

3 (Robert) + 5 (Cindy) + 4 (Aaron) = 12 pounds

Since they want to share the candy equally among themselves, we need to divide the total amount by 3.

12 / 3 = 4

So, each person will have 4 pounds of candy."
"To find the total cost of the candies, we need to calculate the cost of each type of candy and add them together.

The cost of 7 candies of type A is 7 * $0.5 = $3.50.
The cost of 10 candies of type B is 10 * $0.75 = $7.50.

The total cost of the candies is $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.

Adam paid the cashier $15, so the change he got is $15 - $11 = $4."
"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to first determine the total number of days that were good, bad, and neutral in the first 30 days.

We know that Christina had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral. Since the first 8 days were good, the second 8 days were bad, and the third 8 days were neutral, we can calculate the number of neutral days as follows:

Total days = 30
Good days = 12
Bad days = 8
Neutral days = Total days - (Good days + Bad days)
Neutral days = 30 - (12 + 8) = 10

Now, we are given that the next three days were good, neutral, and good. We can add these to the previous counts:

Good days = 12 + 3 = 15
Bad days = 8
Neutral days = 10

Since we are asked to find the number of good days left in the month, we can subtract the total number of good days from the total number of days:

Good days left = Total days - Good days
Good days left = 30 - 15
Good days left = 15

The final answer is 15."
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's represent the number of books Sally has as 'x'. Since Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, we can write the equation as:

2x + 3 = 21

Now, we need to isolate 'x' to find the number of books Sally has. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for 'x':

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

9"
"To solve this problem, we need to convert the height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 20 feet to inches by multiplying 20 by 12.

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we know the bamboo grows 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we can divide the target height (600 inches) by the growth rate (30 inches/day).

600 inches / 30 inches/day = 20 days

Therefore, it will take 20 days for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, James had 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he had 1 toy per dog. 

When he left, there were 8 more dogs in the shelter, making a total of 4 + 8 = 12 dogs. Since each dog needs one toy, James needed 12 toys.

However, when he came back, there were twice as many dogs as when he left, which means there were 2 * 12 = 24 dogs. 

Since 3 dogs were gone, James no longer needed those toys, so he only needed toys for 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.

Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 21 toys in total.

"To find out how much money Skyler invested, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, the total amount invested is $1200.

Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, which is (2/5) * 1200 = 480 dollars.

The remaining amount after Dylan's investment is 1200 - 480 = 720 dollars.

Frances then invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, which is (2/3) * 720 = 480 dollars.

The amount left after Frances' investment is 720 - 480 = 240 dollars.

This amount is Skyler's investment.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find out how many signatures the sisters need to collect, we need to first find out how many signatures they have already collected in total. 

Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. 

20 + 44 = 64 signatures

Since they want to reach 100 signatures in total, we need to subtract the signatures they already have from their goal.

100 - 64 = 36

The sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures."
"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we need to first find out how much she earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.

Since Karen works 3 hours per day, her daily earnings would be $20 * 3 = $60.

To find out her earnings for two days, we multiply her daily earnings by 2: $60 * 2 = $120.

The final answer is 120."
"To find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we need to set up a proportion. 

Let's assume that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns. 

We can set up the proportion as follows: 
6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = x potatoes / y hash browns

We know that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, so we can substitute these values into the proportion:
6 / 36 = x / y

To solve for y, we can cross-multiply:
6y = 36x
y = (36/6)x
y = 6x

Now, we know that 1 potato makes 6 hash browns. To find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we can multiply 96 by 6:
96 * 6 = 576

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

576"
"To find the total weight of the 9 people, we need to multiply the weight of one adult by the number of adults. 

Weight of one adult = 80 kg
Number of adults = 9

Total weight of 9 adults = 80 kg * 9 = 720 kg

Since the maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg, the excess weight is:

Excess weight = Total weight of 9 adults - Maximum load of the elevator
= 720 kg - 700 kg
= 20 kg

The elevator will exceed its maximum load by 20 kg."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cookies Max has, and then determine the number of cookies the Cookie Monster and Summer have.

Since Katarina has 68 cookies and she has 5 less cookies than Max, we can set up an equation to find out how many cookies Max has:

Katarina's cookies = Max's cookies - 5
68 = Max's cookies - 5
Max's cookies = 68 + 5
Max's cookies = 73

Now that we know Max has 73 cookies, we can find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has:

Max's cookies = Cookie Monster's cookies + 12
73 = Cookie Monster's cookies + 12
Cookie Monster's cookies = 73 - 12
Cookie Monster's cookies = 61

Finally, we can find out how many cookies Summer has:

Summer's cookies = Max's cookies + 23
Summer's cookies = 73 + 23
Summer's cookies = 96

Now, let's add up the total number of cookies:

Katarina's cookies + Max's cookies + Cookie Monster's cookies + Summer's cookies
68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298

The total number of cookies is 298."
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to work backwards from the final length. 

Let's denote the original length of the dress as x. 

Since the dress was extended by 50% of its original length, the new length is x + 0.5x = 1.5x. 

We also know that the final length of the dress is 140cm, so we can set up the equation: 1.5x = 140.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 1.5: x = 140 / 1.5 = 93.33.

So, the original length of the dress was approximately 93.33cm.

The final answer is: 93.33"
"To find the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the time it took him to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode.

Since Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour in ""turtle"" mode, he can mow half the lawn in 0.5 hours, which is equivalent to 30 minutes.

In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Therefore, he can mow half the lawn in 20 minutes.

The total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is the sum of the time it took him to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode, which is 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

"To find out how much longer they have to get to school without being late, we need to subtract the time they've already spent walking from the total time available.

Total time available = 30 minutes
Time spent walking to the corner = 6 minutes
Time spent walking to the fire station = 13 minutes

Total time spent walking so far = 6 + 13 = 19 minutes

Time left to get to school = Total time available - Total time spent walking so far
= 30 - 19
= 11 minutes

Therefore, they have 11 minutes to get to school without being late."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 1 kilo of apples is $4.
The cost of 2 kilos of bananas is 2 * $2 = $4.
The cost of 2 kilos of oranges is 2 * $3 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4 (apples) + $4 (bananas) + $6 (oranges) = $14.

Catherine pays a total of $14."
"To find the total number of cookies baked, we need to calculate the number of cookies baked by Celinda. Since Celinda bakes twice as many as Greta, and Greta bakes 30 cookies, Celinda bakes 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

The total number of cookies baked is 30 (by Greta) + 60 (by Celinda) = 90 cookies.

The pair eats 10 cookies, so the number of cookies left is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the age of the younger twin as 'x'. Since there is one set of twins, the age of the older twin would be 'x + 7'. 

We also know that there is a set of triplets, so we'll denote the age of the youngest triplet as 'y'. The ages of the other two triplets would be 'y + 1' and 'y + 2'. 

The combined ages of the twins and the triplets are given as 44. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 7) + y + (y + 1) + (y + 2) = 44

Combine like terms:

2x + 3y + 10 = 44

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x + 3y = 34

Now, we need to find integer values of x and y that satisfy this equation. Since x is the age of a twin and y is the age of a triplet, both x and y should be non-negative integers.

Let's try different values of y to find a solution. 

If y = 4, then 3y = 12, and 2x = 22. Solving for x, we get x = 11.

So, one of the twins is 11 years old.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to calculate the total time he has available before dinner. 

First, we need to convert the time before dinner from hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is equal to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time John has for his homework: 20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes.

To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we subtract the time he has for homework from the total time before dinner: 180 minutes (before dinner) - 80 minutes (homework) = 100 minutes.

John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To find the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we need to calculate the cost of each separately and then add them together.

The cost of 10 lollipops is 10 * $0.40 = $4.00.

The cost of 10 candies is 10 * $3.20 = $32.00.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4.00 + $32.00 = $36.00.

"To find the total number of coins Rong has saved, we need to calculate the total number of months he has been saving. Since there are 12 months in a year, Rong has been saving for 10 years * 12 months/year = 120 months.

Rong saves 20 coins per month, so the total number of coins he has saved is 20 coins/month * 120 months = 2400 coins.

Now, let's calculate the number of coins Neil saves per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so Neil saves 20 coins/month + (2/5 * 20 coins/month) = 20 coins/month + 8 coins/month = 28 coins/month.

The total number of months Neil has been saving is also 120 months. So, the total number of coins Neil has saved is 28 coins/month * 120 months = 3360 coins.

To find the total number of coins they have together, we add the total number of coins Rong and Neil have saved: 2400 coins + 3360 coins = 5760 coins.

The final answer is: 5760"
"To find the total cost of the vaccines, we multiply the cost of one vaccine by 2. 

2 vaccines * $20 per vaccine = $40

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as 'x'. We can express this as 0.6x.

Since the total bill is the sum of the cost of vaccines and the heartworm check, we can write the equation as:

x = $40 + 0.6x

To solve for x, we subtract 0.6x from both sides:

0.4x = $40

Now, we divide both sides by 0.4:

x = $100

So, the total bill is $100. 

Now, we subtract the total bill from the amount John brought with him to find out how much he leaves with:

$125 - $100 = $25

The final answer is $25."
"To find the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

The cost of one banana is twice the cost of one apple, and since one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

The cost of one orange is three times the cost of one banana, so one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the crate:

- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Adding these costs together, we get: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32

Therefore, the price for such a crate of fruit is $32."
"To find the total number of squares, we need to determine the number of each color. 

We know there are 14 red squares. 
There are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so there are 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares. 
There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so there are 18 + 6 = 24 green squares. 
There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so there are 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, we add up the number of squares of each color: 
14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

The total number of squares is 68."
"To find the number of regular chairs, we know that the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. Since there are 8 high chairs, the number of regular chairs is 5 * 8 = 40.

The total number of people attending the function is 42 adults + 15 babies = 57 people.

Since there are 8 high chairs, the number of regular chairs needed is 57 - 8 = 49.

To find the number of additional chairs Mia needs to get, we subtract the number of chairs she already has (8 high chairs) from the total number of chairs needed (49). 

So, Mia needs 49 - 8 = 41 more chairs.

The final answer is 41."
"To find the number of 8-point bucks, we need to calculate 20% of the total number of bucks.

First, we need to find the number of bucks. Since 50% of the deer are bucks, we can calculate the number of bucks as follows:

Number of bucks = Total deer * 0.5
= 50 * 0.5
= 25

Now, we need to find 20% of the number of bucks:

Number of 8-point bucks = Number of bucks * 0.2

Therefore, there are 5 eight-point bucks in the field."
"To find the total points collected by the students, we need to calculate the points collected by each student.

Adam has 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 
30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15.
So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. 
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by all the students: 
Adam + Betty + Marta + Tom = 50 + 65 + 105 + 35 = 255 points.

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. 
The class is missing 400 - 255 = 145 points to go on the trip.

The final answer is 145."

"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks in the city and the number of fireworks in her backyard.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks in the city. There are 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks in the city is 15 * 20 = 300.

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to calculate 40% of 300. To do this, we multiply 300 by 0.4, which gives us 120.

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks in Hannah's backyard. She has 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks in her backyard is 3 * 5 = 15.

Each person consumes 2 drinks and 3 snacks. 

Total drinks = 14 people * 2 drinks/person = 28 drinks
Total snacks = 14 people * 3 snacks/person = 42 snacks

Since each drink and snack costs $2, the total cost is:
Total cost = (Total drinks * $2) + (Total snacks * $2)
Total cost = (28 * $2) + (42 * $2)
Total cost = $56 + $84
Total cost = $140

The group spent $140 on snacks and drinks."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much gravel Gissela's truck can carry. 

Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

The total capacity of the three trucks combined is 11,600 pounds. We know that Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds and Gordy's truck can carry 4,800 pounds. 

So, the total capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds.

Now, we subtract this from the total capacity of the three trucks to find out how much Gary's truck can carry: 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many dumplings each male ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

We know there are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

We also know there are 6 females, and each female ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females must be equal to the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry. Therefore, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is 32 (males) + 18 (females) = 50.

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how much money Gerald had left, we first need to determine the total parts in the ratio, which is 3 + 2 = 5. 

Since Gerald's share is 3 parts, we can calculate his share of the money by multiplying 3/5 of $100, which is (3/5) * 100 = $60. 

Gerald spent $10 on a book, so we subtract this amount from his share: $60 - $10 = $50.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle.

Speed of the cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we need to find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We can use the formula:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

The turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we need to first determine the amount they still need to raise, which is the difference between their goal and the amount already raised.

Amount already raised = $2100
Goal = $6300
Amount still needed = Goal - Amount already raised
= $6300 - $2100
= $4200

Since they raise an equal amount in every hour, we can divide the amount still needed by the hourly amount to find the number of hours they need to fundraise.

Hourly amount = Amount already raised / Number of hours
= $2100 / 3
= $700 per hour

Now, we can divide the amount still needed by the hourly amount to find the total number of hours.

Total hours = Amount still needed / Hourly amount
= $4200 / $700
= 6 hours

Therefore, the firefighters need to fundraise for 6 more hours to reach their goal."
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes and then subtract that from 100%.

The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. 

First, find the percentage of water used for industrial purposes: 
80% of 40% = 0.8 * 0.4 = 0.32 or 32%

Now, subtract this from 100% to find the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes:
100% - 32% = 68%

Therefore, 68% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes."

The total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring is $168."
"To find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we need to first find the rate of production for each type of ice cream.

For chocolate ice cream, the factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours, so the rate is 100 / 2 = 50 quarts per hour.

For vanilla ice cream, the factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, so the rate is 50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we can calculate the total number of quarts made in 48 hours:

Chocolate ice cream: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla ice cream: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Total quarts made in 48 hours = 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts

The total number of quarts made in 48 hours is 3000."
"To calculate Marcus' total bill, we need to first find the total cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The total cost of the croissants is 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
The total cost of the cinnamon rolls is 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
The total cost of the mini quiches is 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
The total cost of the blueberry muffins is 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

The total cost of all items is $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Applying the 10% discount, the discount amount is 10% of $50.00, which is 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

"To determine the number of scoops Erin should buy, we need to calculate the total cost of the scoops she can afford with her $6.00. 

Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide $6.00 by $1.50 to find out how many scoops she can buy. 

$6.00 ÷ $1.50 = 4 scoops

However, the deal is buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. This means for every 3 scoops, Erin only pays for 2. 

So, we can divide the total number of scoops she can afford by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 scoops she can buy. 

4 scoops ÷ 3 scoops per set = 1.33 sets

Since Erin can't buy a fraction of a set, she can buy 1 set of 3 scoops, which is 2 scoops, and get 1 scoop free. 

Therefore, Erin should buy 2 scoops.

"To find out how much candy each person has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total amount of candy they eat in that time period.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces, and Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is 14."
"To find the number of tiles needed, we need to calculate two thirds of the total square footage of the bathroom. 

Two thirds of 36 sq ft is (2/3) * 36 = 24 sq ft.

Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 tiles per square foot, we multiply the area to be covered (24 sq ft) by the number of tiles per square foot (24).

24 sq ft * 24 tiles/sq ft = 576 tiles.

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his bathroom.

"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the cost of buying the blueberries at the store and then subtract the cost of picking them.

Cost of picking blueberries: 
- Initial cost: $20
- Cost per pound: $1.5
- Total cost of blueberries: $20 + (30 pounds * $1.5/pound) = $20 + $45 = $65

Cost of buying blueberries at the store:
- Cost per pound: $2.5
- Total cost of blueberries: 30 pounds * $2.5/pound = $75

Now, let's calculate the amount James saved:
- Savings: $75 (store cost) - $65 (picking cost) = $10

The final answer is: $10"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid, we first need to find the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. Since the price increased by 10%, we need to calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70

New price of each computer = Original price + Increase
= $700 + $70
= $770

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company paid by multiplying the new price of each computer by the number of computers.

Total amount paid = New price of each computer * Number of computers
= $770 * 500
= $385,000

The total amount of money the company paid to buy the computers at the new prices is $385,000."
"To calculate the total calories in the omelet, we need to calculate the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham separately and then add them together.

The omelet contains 6 eggs, each with 75 calories. So, the total calories from eggs are 6 * 75 = 450 calories.

The omelet contains 2 oz of cheese, with 120 calories per ounce. So, the total calories from cheese are 2 * 120 = 240 calories.

The omelet also contains 2 oz of ham, with 40 calories per ounce. So, the total calories from ham are 2 * 40 = 80 calories.

Now, we add the calories from eggs, cheese, and ham together: 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories.

Therefore, the total calories in the omelet are 770.

"To find the total number of taps Helga made, we need to calculate the number of taps she made with her feet during the 5 minutes, considering the time her arms were raised and the time they were not.

First, let's calculate the number of taps she made with her feet when her arms were raised. Since her arms were raised for 2 minutes, she tapped her feet at a rate of 200 taps per minute for 2 minutes, resulting in 2 * 200 = 400 taps.

Next, let's calculate the number of taps she made with her feet when her arms were not raised. Since her arms were not raised for 3 minutes, she tapped her feet at a rate of 300 taps per minute for 3 minutes, resulting in 3 * 300 = 900 taps.

Now, we add the number of taps she made with her feet when her arms were raised and when they were not raised to get the total number of taps she made: 400 + 900 = 1300 taps.

The combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet is 1300."
"To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the potential damage to his car.

The potential damage to Ron's car is $450. 

The cost of fixing the pothole includes the cost of asphalt (3 buckets * $25 = $75) and the fine he would have to pay to the city council ($120). 

So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $75 + $120 = $195.

To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we subtract the total cost of fixing the pothole from the potential damage to his car: $450 - $195 = $255.

Therefore, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself.

"To find out how many slices of pizza were left, we need to calculate the total number of slices first. Since there are 5 people, including Bryce, and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 2 pizzas for these 3 people, they ate 2 * 2/3 = 4/3 pizzas. The number of slices they ate is 4/3 * 12 = 16 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 pizzas for these 2 friends, they ate 2 * ¾ = 1 ½ pizzas. The number of slices they ate is 1 ½ * 12 = 18 slices.

In total, 16 + 18 = 34 slices were eaten. To find the number of slices left, we subtract the total slices eaten from the total number of slices: 60 - 34 = 26.

"To find the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages, we need to calculate 2/3 of the time it takes the cat to eat the sausages. 

The cat eats the sausages in 30 minutes. 
2/3 of 30 minutes is (2/3) * 30 = 20 minutes.

So, the dog eats the sausages in 20 minutes.

To find the average time, we need to add the time it takes for the cat and the dog to eat the sausages and divide by 2.

Average time = (30 + 20) / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

First, we convert 8 feet to inches: 8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches. Then we add the 4 inches to get 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now we know the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches. We are told that this is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. 

Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. Then, we can set up the equation: 9x + 10 = 100.

Now, we solve for 'x': 
9x = 100 - 10
9x = 90
x = 90 / 9
x = 10

So, one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches long.

"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we need to divide the total number of days he wants the gum to last by the number of days he chews per pack.

Since Parker chews 4 pieces of gum per day, we can calculate the total number of pieces he will chew in 30 days: 
4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces

Since a pack has 15 pieces, we can divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack to find the number of packs:
120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

"To determine the total number of smores needed, we first calculate the total number of smores required for the kids and adults separately.

For the kids: 9 kids * 2 smores/kid = 18 smores
For the adults: 6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 6 smores

Total smores needed = 18 + 6 = 24 smores

Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, we divide the total number of smores needed by 8 to find the number of sleeves required:
24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we divide the total number of sleeves needed by 3 to find the number of boxes required:
3 sleeves / 3 sleeves/box = 1 box

Therefore, they will need 1 box of graham crackers."
"To find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to first find their individual ages.

Dora's age is given as 15 years.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the number of marbles each person has.

Let's denote the number of marbles Sean has as S, Carl has as C, and Cal has as L.

We are given that Sean has 56 marbles, so S = 56.

We are also given that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, so C = 4S = 4 * 56 = 224.

Additionally, we are given that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, so S = L/2. Since S = 56, we can find L by multiplying both sides by 2, giving us L = 2S = 2 * 56 = 112.

Now that we know the number of marbles each person has, we can find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined. This is simply C + L = 224 + 112 = 336.

"To determine the number of groups needed, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of groups. However, the question states that 12 groups are already required, and we need to find out how many more groups are needed.

Since 54 students are to be separated into 6 groups, we can calculate the number of students per group as follows:

54 ÷ 6 = 9 students per group

However, the question states that 12 groups are required. To find the number of students per group in this case, we can calculate:

54 ÷ 12 = 4.5 students per group

Since we cannot have a fraction of a group, we need to re-evaluate the situation. The question seems to be inconsistent, as 54 students cannot be divided into 12 groups of equal size. 

However, if we assume that the question is asking for the number of groups needed to accommodate 54 students, we can calculate the number of groups as follows:

54 ÷ 4.5 = 12 groups

Since 12 groups are already required, we need to find the difference between the required number of groups and the number of groups already available:

12 (required) - 12 (already available) = 0

Therefore, no more groups are needed to form the required number of groups.

The number of chairs rented during weekdays in a 4-week month is 20 * 60 = 1200.

The number of chairs rented during weekends in a 4-week month is 8 * 100 = 800.

The total number of chairs rented in a 4-week month is 1200 + 800 = 2000.

Since we want to find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we multiply the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month by 2.

Since each large sticker is worth 3 small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from the trade.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
She had 40 large stickers initially and traded 20 for large buttons, so she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

"To find the total number of matches Joey played, we need to add the matches played on each day.

Joey played 2 matches on Monday and 1 match on Friday. On Saturday, he played double the number of matches he played on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 matches.

Total matches played = 2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7 matches.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic equation. Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as 'x'. Since the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and the sum of votes in favor and against must equal 33. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Now that we know x, we can find the number of votes in favor by multiplying x by 2:

Votes in favor = 2x = 2(11) = 22

The final answer is 22."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. 11 students need size extra-small.
2. Twice as many students need size small as extra small, so 2 * 11 = 22 students need size small.
3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.
4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up the total number of shirts needed: 
11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75

The total number of shirts Krissa ordered is 75."
"To find the amount after the discount, we need to calculate 5% of the marked price and subtract it from the marked price.

5% of $140 = 0.05 * 140 = $7

Now, subtract the discount from the marked price:
$140 - $7 = $133

So, the amount you will pay after the discount is $133."
"To find the total number of hours the playlists will last, we need to multiply the number of songs in each playlist by the number of playlists and then multiply that result by the length of each song.

Number of songs in each playlist = 20
Number of playlists = 20
Length of each song = 10 hours

Total number of songs = 20 * 20 = 400 songs
Total hours = 400 songs * 10 hours/song = 4000 hours

The 20 playlists will last for 4000 hours in total."
"To find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we need to first find the number of people who think horse #2 will win and horse #7 will win.

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win, which is 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. Since 10 people think horse #2 will win, there are 50 - 10 = 40 people remaining. So, 60% of 40 people think horse #7 will win, which is 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. Since 10 + 24 = 34 people think horse #2 and horse #7 will win, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 50 - 34 = 16 people.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. 

Let's denote the total number of Pomeranians as P. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can set up the equation:

(1/3)P = 6

To solve for P, we multiply both sides by 3:

P = 6 * 3
P = 18

So, there are 18 Pomeranians in total.

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let's denote the total number of puppies as T. We can set up the equation:

(2/3)T = 18

To solve for T, we multiply both sides by 3/2:

T = 18 * (3/2)
T = 27

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies.

"To find out how much Jayden needs, we first need to calculate how much money Ava gave him. Since Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, we can calculate it as follows:

$90 / 2 = $45

Now, we add the money Jayden already has to the money Ava gave him:

$70 + $45 = $115

The camera costs $200, so we subtract the total amount Jayden has from the cost of the camera to find out how much more he needs:

$200 - $115 = $85

Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera."
"To find out how many cases of shingles the third house needs, we need to first determine how many cases the first and second houses need.

The total number of cases needed is 250. The second house needs half of the total, which is 250 / 2 = 125 cases.

The third house needs double the amount of the first house. Since we don't know the amount the first house needs, let's denote it as x. Then, the third house needs 2x cases.

We know that the sum of the cases needed by the three houses is 250. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 125 + 2x = 250

Combine like terms:

3x + 125 = 250

Subtract 125 from both sides:

3x = 125

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 41.67

Since x represents the number of cases the first house needs, and the third house needs double that amount, the third house needs 2x = 2 * 41.67 = 83.33 cases.

The third house needs approximately 83.33 cases of shingles."
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

Leila buys 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so she spends 3 x $2 = $6.
Jack buys 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so he spends 5 x $1 = $5.
Chase buys 1 head of lettuce at $3.

Now, let's add the costs together: $6 (cucumbers) + $5 (tomatoes) + $3 (lettuce) = $14.

The total amount spent by the three of them is $14."
"To find the number of pears George has, we need to calculate 45% of the number of bananas he has and add it to the number of bananas.

45% of 200 bananas = 0.45 * 200 = 90

So, George has 90 more pears than bananas. 

Number of pears = Number of bananas + 90
= 200 + 90
= 290

Total number of fruits = Number of bananas + Number of pears
= 200 + 290
= 490

The final answer is 490."
"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to subtract the cost of the ball from the amount of money she had initially. 

Initial amount of money = $80
Cost of the ball = $20
Remaining money = Initial amount of money - Cost of the ball
Remaining money = $80 - $20 = $60

Since each candy bar costs $5, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of each candy bar to find out how many candy bars Marissa bought.

Number of candy bars = Remaining money / Cost of each candy bar
Number of candy bars = $60 / $5
Number of candy bars = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the total cost of making 4 liters of juice, we first need to find out how many kilograms of oranges are required for 4 liters of juice. 

Since 1 liter of juice requires 5 kilograms of oranges, 4 liters will require 4 times that amount, which is 4 * 5 = 20 kilograms of oranges.

Each kilogram of oranges costs $3, so the total cost for 20 kilograms of oranges would be 20 * $3 = $60.

Therefore, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice."
"To find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed, we need to first determine how many books Ahmed read. 

Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can set up an equation: 
Let x be the number of books Ahmed read. 
Ezra read 2x books. 
We know that Ezra read 300 books in total, so 2x = 300. 
Solving for x, we get x = 300 / 2 = 150. 
So, Ahmed read 150 books. 

Now, we add the number of books Ezra read (300) to the number of books Ahmed read (150) to find the total number of books read: 
300 + 150 = 450."
"To calculate Tanya's total earnings, we need to break it down by day.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her earnings for Monday would be:
4 classes * 5 hours * $15 per hour = $60

Additionally, she earns $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes. Since she teaches 4 classes on Monday, she earns an extra $5. So, her total earnings for Monday would be:
$60 + $5 = $65

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her earnings for Wednesday would be:
2 classes * 2 hours * $15 per hour = $30

Since she teaches 2 classes on Wednesday, she does not earn the extra $5. So, her total earnings for Wednesday would be:
$30

Now, let's add her earnings for both days:
$65 (Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) = $95

Tanya earned $95 for these two days of teaching.

"To find the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

Vanilla scents sold: 5 scents per type * 4 types = 20 scents
Fruity scents sold: 2 scents per type * 8 types = 16 scents

Now, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold to find the difference:
20 (vanilla) - 16 (fruity) = 4

The perfume company sold 4 more vanilla scents compared to fruity scents."
"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he earns from selling eggplants. 

He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount of money he earns from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, we need to subtract the amount he earns from eggplants from the total amount he wants to make. 

$135 - $60 = $75

This means he needs to earn $75 from selling 25 ears of corn. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the amount he needs to earn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25).

$75 / 25 = $3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

"To find the total time Tatiana has available for soccer, we need to subtract the time she spends reading and playing video games from her total weekend time.

Total weekend time = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours

Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time
Remaining time after reading = 12 - 3 = 9 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours

Time spent playing soccer = Total weekend time - Time spent reading - Time spent playing video games
= 12 - 3 - 3
= 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total weekend time and multiply by 100:

Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (6 / 12) * 100
= 0.5 * 100
= 50%

The final answer is 50."

1. Anthony started with 50 pencils.
2. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, which is 1/2 * 50 = 25 pencils. So, he has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.
3. He then gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie, which is 3/5 * 25 = 15 pencils. So, he has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Time taken to drive to the museum = Distance / Speed
Time taken to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time taken to drive to the museum = 2 hours

Since Jack drives back home, the total time taken for the round trip = 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours

Adding the time spent at the museum, the total time Jack is gone from home = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time Jack is gone from home = 10 hours"
"To find the total number of wheels needed, we need to calculate the number of wheels required for the cars and the number of wheels required for the motorcycles.

For the cars: 57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels
For the motorcycles: 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels

Total wheels needed = 228 wheels (for cars) + 146 wheels (for motorcycles) = 374 wheels

Now, let's subtract the total wheels needed from the available wheels in the box: 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels

The number of wheels left in the box is 276."
"To find the amount you have to pay after the discount, you need to calculate 20% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

20% of $1000 = 0.20 * $1000 = $200

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:
$1000 - $200 = $800

So, you have to pay $800.

$800"
"To find the cost of replacing the movies, we need to break down the problem into parts.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate this as:

Number of movies in series = Total number of movies / 3
= 600 / 3
= 200

Now, let's find the number of remaining movies that are not in series. We subtract the number of movies in series from the total number of movies:

Number of remaining movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies in series
= 600 - 200
= 400

Next, we need to find the number of older movies. Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, we can calculate this as:

Number of older movies = Number of remaining movies * 0.4
= 400 * 0.4
= 160

Now, we know the cost of the movies in series is $6 each, and the cost of the older movies is $5 each. We also know that the cost of a normal movie is $10.

The cost of the movies in series = Number of movies in series * Cost of a normal movie
= 200 * $10
= $2000

The cost of the older movies = Number of older movies * Cost of an older movie
= 160 * $5
= $800

The cost of the normal movies = Number of normal movies * Cost of a normal movie
= (Total number of movies - Number of movies in series - Number of older movies) * Cost of a normal movie
= (600 - 200 - 160) * $10
= 240 * $10
= $2400

Now, we can find the total cost of replacing the movies by adding the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the normal movies:

Total cost = Cost of movies in series + Cost of older movies + Cost of normal movies
= $2000 + $800 + $2400
= $5000"
"To find the total amount Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of peaches is 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00
The cost of plums is 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00
The cost of apricots is 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, let's add the costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to first find the speed at which they hiked. 

Since they hiked 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed, we can calculate their driving speed as follows:

Driving speed = 50 miles/hour

Half of their driving speed = 50 / 2 = 25 miles/hour

Hiking speed = 25 - 5 = 20 miles/hour

Now, we know the time they spent hiking (1.5 hours) and their hiking speed (20 miles/hour). We can use the formula:

Distance = Speed * Time

Distance = 20 miles/hour * 1.5 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Therefore, the distance to their vacation spot is 30 miles."
"To determine the difference in scores, we need to calculate the points earned by each player.

Let's denote Emma's points as E and Ava's points as A.

Emma's points: 
- She collects 3 more berries than Ava, so she collects 3 + 5 = 8 berries.
- She jumps on 8 fewer enemies than Ava, so she jumps on 8 - 8 = 0 enemies.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, so she finishes the level in 30 - 4 = 26 seconds.

Emma's points = 0 * 10 (for enemies) + 8 * 5 (for berries) + 26 * 30 (for time) = 0 + 40 + 780 = 820.

Ava's points:
- She jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumps on 8 * 10 = 80 enemies.
- She collects 8 fewer berries than Emma, so she collects 8 - 5 = 3 berries.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so she finishes the level in 26 + 4 = 30 seconds.

Ava's points = 80 * 10 (for enemies) + 3 * 5 (for berries) + 30 * 30 (for time) = 800 + 15 + 900 = 1715.

The difference between their scores is 1715 - 820 = 895.

The final answer is: 895"
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of 64 dollars.

First, we subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars: 
64 - 30 - 30 = 4

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2:
4 / 2 = 2

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of times they ride their bikes on the three usual days and the two extra days.

On the usual days, they ride thrice a day, so that's 3 times/day * 3 days = 9 times.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, so that's 2 * 3 times/day = 6 times/day * 2 days = 12 times.

Now, we add the total number of times they ride on both types of days: 9 times + 12 times = 21 times.

Therefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 21 times a week.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. 

Let's denote the number of white fish he bought as 'x'. Since he ended up with twice as many orange fish as white fish, the number of orange fish after buying more is 3 + x.

The total number of fish after buying more is 7 (initial fish) + x (new white fish) + 17 (new fish from the pet store). Since the total number of fish is the sum of the initial fish and the new fish, we can write the equation:

7 + x + 17 = 3 + x + 2x

Combine like terms:

24 + x = 3 + 3x

Subtract x from both sides:

24 = 3 + 2x

Subtract 3 from both sides:

21 = 2x

Divide both sides by 2:

10.5 = x

Since we can't have a fraction of a fish, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can't round down because the question asks for the number of white fish Bob bought, and it's possible that he bought a fraction of a fish. 

So, we'll keep the answer as 10.5.

However, since we can't have a fraction of a fish, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. 

The final answer is 11."
"To calculate the total weekly fuel consumption, we need to first calculate the daily fuel consumption. 

Since Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, and the one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, the round-trip distance is 10 miles. 

Daily fuel consumption = Total distance / Fuel efficiency 
= 10 miles / 10 MPG 
= 1 gallon

Since Andy uses his car to go to work from Monday to Friday, the total number of working days is 5 days.

Total weekly fuel consumption = Daily fuel consumption * Number of working days 
= 1 gallon * 5 days 
= 5 gallons

To calculate the total weekly fuel cost, we multiply the total weekly fuel consumption by the current price of gas.

Total weekly fuel cost = Total weekly fuel consumption * Price per gallon 
= 5 gallons * $3/gallon 
= $15"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch, we need to calculate the amount she spent on the twenties and the amount she spent on the quarters.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on the twenties. She had 10 twenties and spent 3/5 of them. 

3/5 of 10 is (3/5) * 10 = 6 twenties.

Since each twenty is worth $20, the amount she spent on the twenties is 6 * $20 = $120.

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on the quarters. She had 140 quarters and spent all of them. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the amount she spent on the quarters is 140 * $0.25 = $35.

Now, we can find the total amount she paid for lunch by adding the amount she spent on the twenties and the quarters.

Total amount = $120 + $35 = $155.

The final answer is: $155"
"To find the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then add them together.

Tomatoes: 5 plants * 22 tomatoes/plant = 110 tomatoes

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we need to first find the total number of non-OLED TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 TVs.
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 * 40 = 5 TVs.

The total number of non-OLED TVs sold is 10 + 5 = 15 TVs.

Since the total number of TVs sold is 40, the number of OLED TVs sold is 40 - 15 = 25 TVs.

"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to first determine the total cost of the trip and then subtract the amount he has from it. 

The total cost of the trip is $300. Since the school is covering half the cost, the school will pay $300 / 2 = $150. 

Now, we subtract the amount John has from the total cost: $300 - $150 = $150. 

John is missing $150."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the difference in temperature between the day and night, and then divide that by the amount of heat each log provides.

The temperature difference between day and night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we can divide the temperature difference by the heat provided by each log to find the number of logs needed:

12 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 2.4 logs

Since we can't burn a fraction of a log, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure the pipes don't freeze. Therefore, Carson needs to burn at least 3 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

"To find the total number of seashells brought back, we first need to find the total number of groups. 

Since each group has 9 members and there are 90 people in total, we can divide 90 by 9 to find the number of groups: 
90 / 9 = 10 groups.

Now, we know that 3/5 of the number of groups had members bring back seashells. To find the number of groups that brought back seashells, we multiply the total number of groups by 3/5:
10 * (3/5) = 6 groups.

Since each group had 9 members and each member brought back 2 seashells, we can multiply the number of groups by the number of members per group and the number of seashells each member brought back:
6 * 9 * 2 = 108 seashells.

The final answer is 108."
"To find the number of people on the train, we need to subtract the number of people who got off at each stop from the initial number of people on the train, and then add the number of people who got on at each stop.

Initial number of people on the train: 172

Number of people who got on at the first stop: 13
Number of people who got off at the second stop: 38

First, subtract the number of people who got off at the first stop: 172 - 47 = 125
Then, add the number of people who got on at the first stop: 125 + 13 = 138
Finally, subtract the number of people who got off at the second stop: 138 - 38 = 100

Therefore, there are 100 people on the train.

"To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to calculate the number of male lions first. Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, we can divide the number of female lions by 2.

Number of male lions = Number of female lions / 2
= 12 / 2
= 6

Now, we can add up the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions in the enclosure.

Total number of lions = Number of female lions + Number of male lions + Number of lion cubs
= 12 + 6 + 14
= 32

The total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans and subtract it from the $50 bill.

The original price of the jeans is $40. Since they are 25% off, we need to calculate 25% of $40.

25% of $40 = 0.25 * $40 = $10

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:

$40 - $10 = $30

So, the discounted price of the jeans is $30.

Now, subtract the discounted price from the $50 bill:

$50 - $30 = $20

Mike will have $20 left over after paying with a $50 bill."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first calculate the total number of employees after three months. 

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. 

After 1 month: 200 + 20 = 220 employees
After 2 months: 220 + 20 = 240 employees
After 3 months: 240 + 20 = 260 employees

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees. Each employee is paid $4000 per month. 

Total amount paid = Number of employees * Salary per employee
Total amount paid = 260 * $4000
Total amount paid = $1,040,000

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is $1,040,000."

"To find out how much Billy earns, we need to calculate his hourly wage after the two raises. 

Billy's initial hourly wage was $10. After the first raise of $0.50, his new wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. After the second raise of $1.00, his new wage is $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Now, we can calculate Billy's total earnings for 20 hours of work: 
$11.50 * 20 = $230.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's starting salary, so her starting salary is $10.50. 
Sally's hourly wage is $10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00. 
Sally's total earnings for 20 hours of work: 
$11.00 * 20 = $220.

To find out how much more money Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's total earnings from Billy's total earnings:

"To find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has, we need to add the number of each type of stuffed animal she has: 

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Since Bubbles wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up an equation to represent this:

Let x be the number of stuffed goats she buys. The total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + x. The percentage of stuffed goats should be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals, so we can set up the equation:

( x / (14 + x) ) * 100 = 30

To solve for x, we can start by multiplying both sides by (14 + x) to eliminate the fraction:

x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side of the equation:

x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides:

0.7x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.7:

x = 6

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

The number of third-graders who passed is 340, and the number of fourth-graders who passed is 40. 

Since the number of fifth-graders is 400, and their pass rate is twice that of the fourth-graders, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 2 * 40 = 80.

Now, we can calculate the total number of students who passed: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460.

The total number of students in the school is 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students in the school: 460 / 1000 = 0.46 or 46%.

The final answer is 46%."
"To find the total number of square inches Milo can make with two bags of glass chips, we first need to find out how many square inches he can make with one bag. 

Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, and there are 72 chips in a bag, we can divide 72 by 12 to find the number of square inches one bag can make:

72 / 12 = 6 square inches

Since Milo has two bags, we multiply the number of square inches one bag can make by 2:

6 * 2 = 12 square inches

Now, we know that Milo can make 12 square inches of mosaic with two bags. Since he wants his mosaic to be three inches tall, we can divide the total square inches by the height to find the length:

12 / 3 = 4 inches

"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and subtract the number he has already sold.

Initially, Dale had 100 candies. He sold 150, so he was left with 100 - 150 = -50 candies. However, this is not possible since he can't have a negative number of candies.

Then, he ordered 100 more candies, so now he has 100 (initial candies) + 100 (new candies) = 200 candies.

Since he sold 150 candies, he is left with 200 - 150 = 50 candies.

To sell all of his candies, he needs to sell 200 - 50 = 150 more candies.

"To find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to first find the total number of branches he climbed in a week. 

Since Felix made $105 in a week, and he charges $0.25 per branch, we can divide the total amount he made by the cost per branch to find the total number of branches he climbed:

Total branches = Total amount made / Cost per branch
Total branches = $105 / $0.25
Total branches = 420

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day:

Average branches per day = Total branches / 7
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

The final answer is 60."
"To find the total number of petals in the vase, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower:

- Jack played for 20 minutes.
- One of his friends played for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes.
- The other friend played for 10 / 2 = 5 minutes.

The friend who is significantly better played for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes.

Now, let's add up the total time played: 20 + 10 + 5 + 30 = 65 minutes.

Since Jack played for 20 minutes, the other three friends played for 65 - 20 = 45 minutes in total.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the games played:

- Jack played for 20 minutes, so he spent 20 / 20 = 1 quarter.
- The other three friends played for 45 minutes, so they spent 45 / 20 = 2.25 quarters in total.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of Jack's games and the cost of the other three friends' games: 1 + 2.25 = 3.25 quarters.

Since 1 quarter is equal to $0.25, the total cost is 3.25 * $0.25 = $0.8125.

The final answer is: $0.81"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the amount of salt as S, the amount of oil as O, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of citrus zest as Z, and the amount of sugar as G.

We are given the following information:

1. Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so Z = F.
2. Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so S = G.
3. Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.
4. The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so S + O + F + Z + G = 10.

Substituting the first two equations into the fourth equation, we get:
S + O + S + S + S = 10
Combine like terms:
3S + O = 10

Now, substitute O = 2S into the equation:
3S + 2S = 10
Combine like terms:
5S = 10

Divide both sides by 5:
S = 2

Now that we know S, we can find O:
O = 2S
O = 2(2)
O = 4

The final answer is 4."
"To find the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 goats at $500 each is 3 x $500 = $1500.
The cost of 2 cows at $1500 each is 2 x $1500 = $3000.

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

Therefore, John spent $4500 at the market."
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Total cupcakes needed = 63
Cupcakes already has = 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48

Number of cupcakes Paul needs to buy = Total cupcakes needed - Cupcakes already has
= 63 - 48
= 15

Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2, which gives us 8 cars sold.

Now, Joe has 40 - 8 = 32 cars left.

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

Finally, Joe has 32 - 16 = 16 cars left.

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to subtract the amount raised by organizations from the total amount raised by the charity. 

Total amount raised by charity = $175,000
Amount raised by organizations = $50,000

Amount raised by students = Total amount raised by charity - Amount raised by organizations
Amount raised by students = $175,000 - $50,000
Amount raised by students = $125,000

Since there are 20 students, we can divide the amount raised by students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised.

Amount raised by each student = Amount raised by students / Number of students
Amount raised by each student = $125,000 / 20
Amount raised by each student = $6,250

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day separately.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes

On the second day, Sandy walked for half as many hours as she did on the first day. So, she walked for:

8 hours / 2 = 4 hours

Converting this to minutes:

4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes

Now, we add the time she walked on both days to find the total time:

480 minutes + 240 minutes = 720 minutes

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 50 cars in the parking lot.

During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.

When Hunter got out of class for lunch, 1/2 of the cars had left. To find the number of cars that left, we need to calculate 1/2 of 70, which is 70 / 2 = 35.

So, the number of cars that remained in the parking lot during lunch break is 70 - 35 = 35.

Therefore, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35.

35"
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a week and then multiply it by the payment per task.

Since John does 30 cycles of work a day, and there are 7 days in a week, the total number of cycles he completes in a week is:
30 cycles/day * 7 days = 210 cycles

Each cycle has 5 tasks, so the total number of tasks he completes in a week is:
210 cycles * 5 tasks/cycle = 1050 tasks

Since each task pays $1.20, the total amount he makes in a week is:
1050 tasks * $1.20/task = $1260

The final answer is: $1260"
"To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we need to calculate her points in each game.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. 

So, in the second game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points.

Now, we add the points from both games: 14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total number of tins of cat food, we multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 
8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

To find the total number of tins of dog food, we multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 
6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food to find the difference: 
88 - 36 = 52.

The difference in the number of tins of cat food and dog food is 52."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has:

Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

The final answer is: 153"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color and then add them together.

Let's start with the green eggs. Cindy had 5 green eggs.

Since she had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.

She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

Lastly, she had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

Therefore, Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"To calculate the total cost of shipping, we need to multiply the weight of the book by the cost per pound and the distance by the cost per mile, then add the two amounts together.

Weight cost: 4 pounds * $0.35/pound = $1.40
Distance cost: 20 miles * $0.08/mile = $1.60
Total shipping cost: $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Since Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, we need to calculate 75% of $32.
Refund amount: 0.75 * $32 = $24

To find out how much Milly will lose, we subtract the refund amount from the total cost of the book and shipping.
Loss: $32 (book cost) + $3 (shipping cost) - $24 (refund) = $11

The final answer is: $11"
"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the initial amount she had.

Mulan initially had $40.
Her father gave her $100, so now she has $40 + $100 = $140.

She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so the total cost of jeans is 2 * $30 = $60.
She also buys a bag for $20.

The total amount she spent is $60 + $20 = $80.

Now, subtracting the total amount spent from the total amount she had: $140 - $80 = $60.

Mulan has $60 left.

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for each week.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find the production for the fourth week, we need to know the total production for the first three weeks. 

The total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, we can subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week.

50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

Therefore, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week."
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and add them together.

Time spent on writing songs: 2 hours/week * 4 weeks = 8 hours
Time spent on makeup: 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes/week
Converting 90 minutes to hours: 90 minutes / 60 = 1.5 hours/week
Total time spent on TikTok per week: 8 hours + 1.5 hours = 9.5 hours/week

Total time spent on TikTok in a month: 9.5 hours/week * 4 weeks = 38 hours

"To calculate the total cost, we need to first calculate the cost of the standard items and the additional items.

The standard items are 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier. However, Angela only needs 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. We will assume the shelves are not included in the original quote.

The cost of the standard items is $129.00.

The additional items Angela needs are 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors, 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier, and 20 - 10 = 10 pictures.

The cost of the additional items is 2 * $15.00 = $30.00 for the mirrors, 1 * $15.00 = $15.00 for the chandelier, and 10 * $15.00 = $150.00 for the pictures.

The total cost is $129.00 + $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $324.00.

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to first find out how much money Anthony has. 

Since Eva has saved $20.00 and Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, Anthony has $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find out how much Roy has, we need to calculate 40% of Anthony's savings and add it to Anthony's savings.

40% of $30.00 is 0.4 * $30.00 = $12.00.

So, Roy has $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

The final answer is: $42.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the mountains that each person can lift. 

Since Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, we can start by finding the height of the mountains that Saskay can lift. 

Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches. 

Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches. 

Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches. 

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). 

480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance covered in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance covered in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance covered in the first 4 hours + Distance covered in the next 6 hours
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

The total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles."
"To solve this problem, we first need to find the speed of the kangaroo. Since 3 kangaroos can cover the distance in 18 hours, we can find the speed of one kangaroo by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos.

Speed of one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 6 hours

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, the speed of each turtle is:

Speed of each turtle = Speed of kangaroo / 2
Speed of each turtle = 6 hours / 2
Speed of each turtle = 3 hours

Now, we can find the time it takes for four turtles to cover the same distance as 3 kangaroos. Since the distance remains the same, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Since we don't know the exact distance, we can use the fact that the ratio of the time taken by the kangaroos to the time taken by the turtles is equal to the ratio of their speeds. 

Time taken by 3 kangaroos / Time taken by 4 turtles = Speed of 1 kangaroo / Speed of 1 turtle
18 hours / Time taken by 4 turtles = 6 hours / 3 hours
Time taken by 4 turtles = (18 hours * 3 hours) / 6 hours
Time taken by 4 turtles = 9 hours

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 9 hours to travel across the highway.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many clay dishes each person made and then add them together.

We know that Kora made 20 dishes. Since Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.

We also know that Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, we can add up the number of dishes each person made to find the total number of dishes: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140.

The total number of clay dishes they all make together is 140."
"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop and receiving the additional help from her mom.

First, let's calculate the price of the laptop after trading in her old one: 
$600 - $200 = $400

Erika already has some savings in her purse, and she also received $150 for her part-time job. Her mom is giving her $80. So, the total amount she has is the sum of these three amounts.

Let's denote the amount Erika has in her purse as x. We know that x + 150 + 80 = 400 + 50 (the amount she needs to buy the laptop).

Now, we can solve for x:
x + 230 = 450
x = 450 - 230
x = 220

So, Erika has $220 in her purse."
"To find the total number of apple slices, we need to calculate the number of slices from the large apples and the small apples separately.

3 large apples can be sliced into 3 * 5 = 15 slices.
5 small apples can be sliced into 5 * 3 = 15 slices.

In total, Adam has 15 + 15 = 30 slices.

Since Adam eats 15 slices, the number of slices left is 30 - 15 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total amount of milk the farmer currently produces, we multiply the amount of milk per cow by the number of cows: 5 liters * 3 cows = 15 liters.

To find out how many liters of milk the farmer needs to produce per day, we subtract the current amount from the desired amount: 25 liters - 15 liters = 10 liters.

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, we divide the additional amount of milk needed by the amount each cow produces: 10 liters / 5 liters per cow = 2 cows.

The farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day."
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to first find the length of the glue sticks that are used and then subtract that from the total length of the glue sticks.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. 
The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used.
The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used.

Now, we need to find the total length of the glue sticks that are used. 

For the first glue stick: 5/6 * 12 mm = 10 mm
For the second glue stick: 1/3 * 12 mm = 4 mm
For the third glue stick: 1/2 * 12 mm = 6 mm

Total length of the glue sticks that are used = 10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm

Now, we subtract the total length of the glue sticks that are used from the total length of the glue sticks to find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used.

Total length of the glue sticks = 3 * 12 mm = 36 mm
Total length of the glue sticks that are not used = 36 mm - 20 mm = 16 mm

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 mm."

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of socks Peter and Jack have. 

Since Jack collected 60 dishes and he has half times as many dishes as socks, we can find the number of socks Jack has by multiplying the number of dishes by 2. 

Number of socks Jack has = 2 * 60 = 120

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can find the number of socks Peter has by multiplying the number of socks Jack has by 2.

Number of socks Peter has = 2 * 120 = 240

Now, we know that Jack has 60 dishes and Peter has twice as many dishes as Jack, so we can find the number of dishes Peter has by multiplying the number of dishes Jack has by 2.

Number of dishes Peter has = 2 * 60 = 120

Now, we can find the total number of socks and dishes they have together by adding the number of socks and dishes they have.

Total number of socks and dishes = 240 (Peter's socks) + 120 (Jack's socks) + 60 (Jack's dishes) + 120 (Peter's dishes)

Now, we need to subtract the time for the intermission from the total concert time to find the available time for the groups. 

Total concert time = 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time for intermission = 10 minutes
Available time for groups = Total concert time - Time for intermission = 120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes

"To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm after the sale.

Initially, Farm X had 55 goats and Farm Y had 45 goats.

Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is 55 - 10 = 45.

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25.

Now, we add the number of goats left in both farms: 45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70.

The total number of goats left in both farms is 70."

In the third year, they will double the number of homes built in the previous two years, which is 2 * (12 + 36) = 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's add the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

The town will have built 144 homes over the next three years."
"Let's denote my age as 'x'. Since I am three years younger than my brother, my brother's age is x + 3. I am 2 years older than my sister, so my sister's age is x - 2.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, which is 3(x + 3) - 1 = 3x + 8.

The sum of our ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 8) = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 5x = 78.

Divide by 5: x = 15.6.

Since age cannot be a fraction, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, but in this case, it's not necessary as the question asks for a numerical answer."
"To find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs, we first need to determine the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks required is 27 * 2 = 54.

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by 8 to find out how many packs are needed. 

54 / 8 = 6.75

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure every student gets 2 glue sticks. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water passing through the river on the third day. 

Initially, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons. After the first day, it doubles to 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons. 

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons. So, the total amount of water passing through the river on the third day is 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. 

Initially, there are 10 infected people. 

Day 1: 10 people infect 6 others, so the total number of infected people becomes 10 + 6 = 16.

Day 2: The 16 infected people from Day 1 infect 6 others each, so the total number of infected people becomes 16 + (16 * 6) = 16 + 96 = 112.

Day 3: The 112 infected people from Day 2 infect 6 others each, so the total number of infected people becomes 112 + (112 * 6) = 112 + 672 = 784.

Therefore, after three days, there are 784 people infected.

784"
"To find out how much money Julieta received, we need to calculate 10% of the total amount Rafaela received. 

First, we find 10% of $20: 
10% of $20 = 0.1 * $20 = $2

Since Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela, we subtract $2 from Rafaela's total:
$20 - $2 = $18

Now, we add the amount Julieta received to Rafaela's amount:
$18 + $20 = $38

The total amount of money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips is $38."
"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to subtract the total number of oranges she gave to her children from the total number of oranges she initially bought.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges.
She gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, so she gave 2 * 3 = 6 oranges to her daughters.
She also gave 3 oranges to her son.
In total, she gave away 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Now, let's subtract the number of oranges she gave away from the total number of oranges she bought:
12 - 9 = 3

Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 12 badges.

Since it takes Amber twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, Amber earns 1/2 of Claire's badges per month. So, Amber earns 1/2 badge per month. In a year, Amber earns 12 * 1/2 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. So, Wendy earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

The final answer is 30."
"To find the total amount raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices baked and sold. 

Paige baked 2 loaves per hour, and she baked for 5 hours (from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM). So, the total number of loaves baked is 2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the total number of slices by the price per slice: 80 slices * $0.50/slice = $40.

The final answer is $40."
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to first find the number of silver coins. 

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation: 
Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. 
Then, the number of gold coins is 'x + 30'. 
We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation: 
x + 30 = 70 
Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get: 
x = 40 

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins: 
Total coins = 70 (gold) + 40 (silver) = 110 

The final answer is 110."
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to first calculate the total number of burritos given to the students. Since there were 50 students and each student was given 10 burritos, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

However, Mr. George ate 20 burritos, so we need to subtract those from the total number of burritos given to the students. 

The total number of leftover burritos is 500 - 20 = 480.

The final answer is 480."
"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first determine the number of green and blue cars.

Since there are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars, so the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we know the total number of cars is 75. We have 12 red cars, 10 green cars, and 30 blue cars. 

To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars: 75 - 12 - 10 - 30 = 23.

Therefore, the rink has 23 yellow cars."
"To solve this problem, we can start by using variables to represent the number of books each person has. Let's say Anne has x books. Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has x + 25 books. 

We are also told that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has x + 12 books.

We know that the total number of books is 85, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 25) + (x + 12) = 85

Combine like terms:

3x + 37 = 85

Subtract 37 from both sides:

3x = 48

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 16

Now that we know Anne has 16 books, we can find the number of books Fawn has:

Fawn has x + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28 books.

The final answer is 28."
"To find the weight of the carrots, we need to first find the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the carrots weigh 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The final answer is: 7"
"To determine the total amount of jello Greg needs, we first need to calculate the total number of jello cups required. 

There are 30 kids, and each kid needs 4 jello cups. So, the total number of jello cups required is 30 * 4 = 120 cups.

Since a three-ounce box makes 10 small jello cups, we need to calculate how many boxes are required to make 120 cups. 

120 cups / 10 cups per box = 12 boxes

Each box costs $1.25, so the total cost will be 12 * $1.25 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total cost of the phones, we multiply the number of phones by the price per phone: 
5 phones * $700 per phone = $3500

The seller pays with $4000, so we subtract the total cost from the amount paid: 
$4000 - $3500 = $500

The seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we need to first find out how much he spends in a month. 

Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

The total cost is $400. 
40% of $400 is 0.4 * 400 = $160. 

So, Keenan pays $160 per month. 

To find out how much he spends per week, we divide the monthly cost by 4. 

$160 / 4 = $40 per week.

The final answer is $40."
"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day and add them together.

First, let's find out how many pieces he ate on the first day. Since he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces, we can calculate it as follows:

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, he ate 24 pieces on the first day.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's find out how many pieces are left after the first two days. We subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total:

60 - 24 - 10 = 26

Now, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces on the third day. We can calculate it as follows:

7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14

So, he ate 14 pieces on the third day.

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate each day:

24 + 10 + 14 = 48

Tobias has eaten 48 pieces so far.

48"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the soda and the cost of the water separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 bottles of soda is 3 * $21.00 = $63.00

"To find out how much money David has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the bolts and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

The cost of one bolt is $0.03. Since David wants to buy 16 bolts, the total cost will be:
16 * $0.03 = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount of money David has:
$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts."
"To find Ella's hourly rate, we need to divide the amount she earned ($33) by the number of hours she worked (3). 

$33 ÷ 3 = $11 per hour

Now, we can multiply her hourly rate by the total number of hours she will work (12) to find her total earnings.

$11 per hour × 12 hours = $132

The final answer is 132."
"To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow the order of operations.

Initially, Paul has 52 marbles. His friend gave him 28 marbles, so now he has 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.

Then, he lost 1/4 of his marbles. To find 1/4 of 80, we multiply 80 by 1/4, which is 20. So, he lost 20 marbles.

Now, we subtract the marbles he lost from the total: 80 - 20 = 60.

Paul has 60 marbles left.

60"
"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points from each type of question and add them together.

For multiple-choice questions: 
Number of correct answers = 80% of 10 = 0.8 * 10 = 8
Points from multiple-choice questions = 8 * 1 = 8

For true/false questions:
Number of correct answers = 90% of 20 = 0.9 * 20 = 18
Points from true/false questions = 18 * 1 = 18

For long-answer questions:
Number of correct answers = 60% of 5 = 0.6 * 5 = 3
Points from long-answer questions = 3 * 5 = 15

Total points = 8 + 18 + 15 = 41

The final answer is 41."
"To find the total amount Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000, we first need to calculate the number of chickens he plans to sell. 

Isaias has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them. 

3/5 of 300 chickens = (3/5) * 300 = 180 chickens

Since he plans to sell these 180 chickens at $50 each, the total revenue from selling the chickens will be:

180 chickens * $50/chicken = $9000

However, Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. To find the total cost of the chickens, we subtract the desired profit from the total revenue:

$9000 - $2000 = $7000

Now, we need to find the cost per chicken. We know that Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens for $9000. To find the cost per chicken, we divide the total cost by the number of chickens:

$7000 / 180 chickens = $38.89 per chicken

So, Isaias bought the chicken he took to the market for sale for approximately $38.89."
"To find out how many glasses Micah sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 3, since there are 3 people selling lemonade. 

32 glasses / 3 people = 10.67 glasses per person

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, Micah also sold 10.67 glasses. 

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold.

14 glasses (Julie) - 10.67 glasses (Micah) = 3.33 glasses

The final answer is 3.33."
"To find the total amount Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them together.

The cost of the hair service is $400.

The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the hair service, which is 1/4 * $400 = $100.

The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the manicure, which is 3/4 * $100 = $75.

Now, we add the costs of all services together: $400 + $100 + $75 = $575.

The total amount Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to calculate the cost of the new rope and subtract it from the amount she has.

The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and it's 20 meters long, so the total cost is:
20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30

Sarah has the rope for $2 per meter, and it's 20 meters long, so she has:
20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the amount Sarah has:
$40 - $30 = $10

Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope.

"To find the number of years it will take for Melanie's age to be thrice her present age, we need to first find her present age. 

Since Melanie will be 18 years old in 10 years, her present age is 18 - 10 = 8 years.

Now, we need to find the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age. 

Let's denote the number of years as 'x'. 

So, 8 + x = 3 * 8

Simplifying the equation, we get:
8 + x = 24

Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get:
x = 16

Therefore, it will take 16 years for Melanie's age to be thrice her present age.

16"
"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart.

First, we know that 5 packs of bacon cost $10. Since each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, the cost of each pack of chicken is $10 * 2 = $20. So, 6 packets of chicken cost 6 * $20 = $120.

Next, we know that 3 packs of strawberries cost $4 each, so the total cost of strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

Lastly, 7 packs of apples cost half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. So, the total cost of apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart: $10 (bacon) + $120 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $156.

Since Kelly's budget is $65, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget to find out how much money she has left: $65 - $156 = -$91.

However, since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this indicates that Kelly does not have enough money in her budget to buy all the items in her cart."
"To find the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts, we need to subtract the encore time from the total runtime of the final concert and then divide by 2.

First, subtract the encore time from the total runtime:

The final answer is 25."
"To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he initially had.

Initial number of toys = 200
Number of toys given away = 40 (to Alyssa) + 80 (to Bonnie) + 30 (to Nicky) = 150

Number of toys Argo has now = Initial number of toys - Number of toys given away
= 200 - 150
= 50

Argo has 50 toys now."
"To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to add the number of chimichangas made on each day.

On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, the shop makes 125 chimichangas each day. 
So, the total number of chimichangas made on these two days is 125 + 125 = 250.

On Fridays, the shop makes twice as many chimichangas as on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, which is 2 * 125 = 250.

Now, we add the total number of chimichangas made on all three days: 250 + 250 = 500.

The total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To find the number of pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange, we first need to find the total number of microphones that were successfully arranged. 

Since 20% of the microphones couldn't fit, that means 80% of the microphones were successfully arranged. 

Number of microphones successfully arranged = Total number of microphones * 0.8
= 50 * 0.8
= 40

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we divide the number of microphones successfully arranged by 2 to find the number of pairs.

Number of pairs = Number of microphones successfully arranged / 2
= 40 / 2
= 20

The final answer is 20."
"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate the number of birds in each category and add them together.

First, let's find the number of birds flying overhead: 
2/3 of 6 birds = (2/3) * 6 = 4 birds

Next, let's find the total number of birds in the groups: 
3 groups * 8 birds per group = 3 * 8 = 24 birds

Now, we add the number of birds in each category: 
6 (nesting) + 4 (flying) + 24 (feeding) = 34 birds

The total number of birds Jerry counts is 34."
"To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to first determine the total number of cookies Lani placed into the jars. 

She started with 55 cookies and ate 5, so the number of cookies left is 55 - 5 = 50.

Since she placed the remaining cookies equally into 5 jars, we divide the remaining cookies by 5:

50 ÷ 5 = 10

So, there were 10 cookies in each jar."
"To find the total number of petals on the orchids, we multiply the number of orchids by the number of petals per orchid: 5 orchids * 5 petals = 25 petals.

To find the total number of petals on the daisies, we multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 4 daisies * 10 petals = 40 petals.

Now, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies to find the difference: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

The daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids."
"To find the number of flowering plants, we first need to find the number of indoor and outdoor plants.

Number of indoor plants = 1/4 * 100 = 25
Number of remaining plants = 100 - 25 = 75

Number of outdoor plants = 2/3 * 75 = 50
Number of flowering plants = 75 - 50 = 25

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100.

Percentage of flowering plants = (25 / 100) * 100 = 25%

The final answer is 25."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the speeds of the whirligig, thingamabob, and whatchamacallit. 

Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as 'x'. Since a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, its speed is 11x. 

We are given that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. So, we can set up the equation 11x = 121 to find the speed of the thingamabob.

Solving for x, we get x = 121 / 11 = 11 meters per second.

Now, since a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob, its speed is 5x. Substituting the value of x, we get 5 * 11 = 55 meters per second.

Therefore, the whirligig spins at 55 meters per second."
"To find the cost of one carrot, we need to first determine the total cost of the salad and yogurt. 

The salad costs $6, and the yogurt costs half of that, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3. 

The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9. 

Since Ellen pays $11 in total, the cost of the carrots is $11 - $9 = $2. 

Therefore, Ellen pays $2 for one carrot every day."
"To find Mark's new hourly wage, we need to add the $2 raise to his original hourly wage. 

New hourly wage = $10 + $2 = $12

Since Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, we can calculate his weekly earnings as follows:

Weekly earnings = New hourly wage * Number of hours worked per week
Weekly earnings = $12 * 8 * 5
Weekly earnings = $480

The final answer is: $480"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much Tasha made from mowing lawns. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of times Tasha mowed lawns is 3x + 5x = 8x.

Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and we know that she mowed Joe's lawn x times, we can set up the equation 6x = 6. 

Solving for x, we get x = 1.

So, Tasha mowed Joe's lawn once, Kamala's lawn three times, and Alba's lawn five times. 

The total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns is 6x + 3(6) + 5(6) = 6 + 18 + 30 = 54.

Since Tasha made $80 in total, the amount she made from lemonade sales is 80 - 54 = 26.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many notebooks Joseph had initially. Since Martha had 7 notebooks and she had 3 times as many as Joseph, we can set up an equation:

Let's say Joseph had x notebooks.
Martha had 3x notebooks.
Since Martha had 7 notebooks, we can set up the equation: 3x = 7

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3:
x = 7 / 3
x = 2.33 (approximately)

So Joseph had approximately 2.33 notebooks initially.

Now, we know Martha bought 5 more notebooks, so she now has 7 + 5 = 12 notebooks.

To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract Joseph's initial number of notebooks from Martha's current number of notebooks:
12 - 2.33 = 9.67

So, Martha now has 9.67 more notebooks than Joseph."
"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we need to first calculate Anis's distance. 

Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis's distance as follows:

Anis's distance = Dijana's distance + (1/5 * Dijana's distance)
= 50 + (1/5 * 50)
= 50 + 10
= 60 miles

Now, we can find the total distance rowed by both of them by adding their individual distances:

Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis's distance
= 50 + 60
= 110 miles

The final answer is: 110"
"To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we first need to subtract the cookies that Susan's husband took from the total number of cookies. 

Total cookies = 100
Cookies taken by husband = 4

Remaining cookies = Total cookies - Cookies taken by husband
Remaining cookies = 100 - 4
Remaining cookies = 96

Now, we divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews to find out how many each will get.

Number of nephews = 6
Cookies per nephew = Remaining cookies / Number of nephews
Cookies per nephew = 96 / 6
Cookies per nephew = 16

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how many pages Denise read more than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday, which is 13 + 5 = 18 pages. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, his total is still 13 pages.

Now, let's calculate the difference in the number of pages Denise read more than Daniel. Denise read 10 + 18 = 28 pages, while Daniel read 13 pages. 

The difference is 28 - 13 = 15 pages.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we first need to calculate the total number of bowls of soup Calvin has. 

Since the pot can fill four adult bowls or eight child's bowls, we can say that the pot can fill 4x = 8 bowls. 

Calvin, his wife, and their two children make a total of 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 adults. 

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls, Calvin can have 4 bowls for himself and his wife. This leaves 8 - 4 = 4 bowls for the children.

Now, we need to determine how many times the 4 bowls can be divided among the 2 children. 

4 bowls / 2 children = 2 bowls per child.

So, each child can have 2 bowls of soup for lunch from the leftover soup."
"To find the total amount William spent, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately and then add them together.

The cost of 5 notebooks is 5 x $1.50 = $7.50
The cost of 1 ballpen is $0.50

Total cost = $7.50 + $0.50 = $8

The total amount William spent is $8."
"To find the total material needed, we need to calculate the material required for small and large masks separately and then add them together.

For small masks: 
Number of small masks = 20
Material needed for small masks = Number of small masks * Material needed per small mask
= 20 * 2 yards
= 40 yards

For large masks:
Number of large masks = 8
Material needed for large masks = Number of large masks * Material needed per large mask
= 8 * 2.25 yards
= 18 yards

Total material needed = Material needed for small masks + Material needed for large masks
= 40 yards + 18 yards
= 58 yards

The final answer is: 58"
"To find the average price per ticket, we need to divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets purchased. 

Deepa has seen each movie 3 times, so she has purchased 9 * 3 = 27 tickets. 

The total amount spent is $216. 

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
= $216 / 27
= $8

The average price per ticket is $8."
"To find Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total hours in a day and subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

There are 24 hours in a day. 

Harold sleeps for 10 hours, so he has 24 - 10 = 14 hours left.

He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

He walks his dog for 1 hour.

Now, let's subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog from the total hours in a day: 
24 - 10 - 8 - 1 = 5

Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day."
"To find the number of red and blue shoe boxes left, we need to calculate the number of red and blue shoe boxes used for fishing and subtract that from the initial number of each.

For blue shoe boxes: 
Initial blue shoe boxes = 7
Blue shoe boxes used = 3
Blue shoe boxes left = 7 - 3 = 4

For red shoe boxes: 
Initial red shoe boxes = 9
Red shoe boxes used = 1/3 * 9 = 3
Red shoe boxes left = 9 - 3 = 6

So, the number of red shoe boxes left is 6 and the number of blue shoe boxes left is 4.

"To find the number of books Joseph currently has, we need to first find out how many books he had initially. Since Joseph had twice the number of Sarah's books, and Sarah has 9 books, Joseph initially had 2 * 9 = 18 books.

However, Joseph lost 2 books, so we need to subtract 2 from the initial number of books he had. 

18 - 2 = 16

Joseph currently has 16 books."
"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to first calculate how many marbles he gave away. 

He gave 1/5 of 30 marbles to Jamie, which is (1/5) * 30 = 6 marbles. 

Then, he gave 10 marbles to Donald. 

So, the total marbles Dean gave away is 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

Now, we subtract the marbles given away from the total marbles Dean had initially: 30 - 16 = 14.

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.

14"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We are given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be expressed as:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

We are also given that Duncan's current age is 60. So, D = 60.

Substituting D = 60 into the equation, we get:

60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)
52 = 2A - 8

Now, let's solve for A:

52 + 8 = 2A
60 = 2A
A = 30

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

A + 8 = 30 + 8
A + 8 = 38

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total number of acres, we need to first calculate the size of Farmer Smith's farm. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's farm. Since Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, twice that would be 2 * 200 = 400 acres. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than that, so it is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we add the acres of both farms together: 200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The two farms have 700 acres together."
"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to first determine how many packages he completes in that time. 

He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour. 

Since he works for 8 hours, he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages in a typical eight-hour workday.

He gets paid $0.20 for every package, so his total earnings for the day would be 320 * 0.20 = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time John spends on both the normal and extreme sudoku puzzles. 

First, we calculate the time for the normal sudoku: 45 minutes. 

Since the extreme sudoku takes 4 times as long, we multiply 45 minutes by 4: 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Now, we add the time for both puzzles: 45 + 180 = 225 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we divide the total time by 30 minutes to find out how many bottles he drinks: 225 / 30 = 7.5.

The final answer is 7.5."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons. 

We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We also know that there are 20 red balloons. 

Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as 'y'. Since Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna in total, we can set up the equation:

2 * 20 + 3 * y = 58

Simplifying the equation:

40 + 3y = 58

Subtract 40 from both sides:

3y = 18

Divide both sides by 3:

y = 6

So, there are 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

"To determine the number of tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total distance he drives in 30 days. 

Since Jon drives 100 miles a day, the total distance driven in 30 days is:
100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can divide the total distance driven by 1000 to find the number of tune-ups needed:
3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3

Jon needs 3 tune-ups in 30 days."
"To find the total hours Bruce works in the three days, we need to calculate the hours he works each day.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.
On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours he works each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find out how much money Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2.

First, let's calculate the cost of the balloons. Since 1 dozen balloons cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, 1 balloon costs $0.5 / 2 = $0.25. So, 12 balloons cost $0.25 * 12 = $3.

The total cost of the items purchased is the cost of the cake ($11) + the cost of the balloons ($3) + the cost of the ice cream (2 * $7 = $14). So, the total cost is $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since they combined their allowance, the total amount of money they had is $28. To find out how much each of them received, we divide the total amount by 2: $28 / 2 = $14.

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14.

14"
"To find the total number of fruits Kira bought, we need to add the number of apples, bananas, and oranges.

Total number of fruits = 3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14

Since Lola ate 2 pieces of fruit, we subtract 2 from the total number of fruits.

Number of fruits left = 14 - 2 = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students in each sport and then add them together.

There are 6 students playing tennis and twice that number playing volleyball, so there are 6 * 2 = 12 students playing volleyball.

The total number of students playing sports is 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) = 18.

There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so the total number of students playing soccer is 16 + 22 = 38.

Now, we add the total number of students playing sports: 18 (tennis and volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56.

Therefore, there are 56 students in total."
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

Total number of lollipops sold = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops
Total revenue = 300 lollipops * $0.8/lollipop = $240
Total cost = 300 lollipops * $0.5/lollipop = $150

Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $240 - $150 = $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and then add them together.

Larry has 3 cats.
He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 x 3 = 9 dogs.
He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 x 7 = 21 fish.
He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 1/3 x 21 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets.

The total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"To determine how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices each person can eat per day and then divide the total number of slices in the loaf by the combined daily consumption.

Abby eats 2 slices per day, and Josh eats twice as much, so Josh eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices per day.

Combined daily consumption: 2 (Abby) + 4 (Josh) = 6 slices per day.

Now, divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the combined daily consumption (6):

24 ÷ 6 = 4

The loaf of bread will last 4 days.

"To find the total number of shells Martha has collected, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and now she is 10 years old, the number of months she has been collecting shells is 10 - 5 = 5 years.

Since she collects one shell per month, the total number of shells collected is equal to the number of months she has been collecting shells, which is 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

Therefore, Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday."
"To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we first need to determine the total number of cups of mint tea. Since Lana brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea, and she has 27 cups in total, the number of cups of mint tea is 27 - 15 = 12.

Since she divides the cups into 3 rows, and each row has an equal number of cups of mint tea, we can divide the total number of cups of mint tea by 3 to find the number of cups in each row. 

12 / 3 = 4

So, there are 4 cups of mint tea in each row."
"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick per trip, we need to first determine the total number of trips he can make in 8 hours. 

Since it takes 4 hours for the sloth to make a round trip, we divide the total time available (8 hours) by the time per trip (4 hours):

8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips

Since the sloth can make 2 trips in 8 hours, and he wants to collect 24 berries, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips:

24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip

Therefore, the sloth needs to pick 12 berries per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in the tank after 6 days. 

Initially, the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, which is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Since the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, after 6 days, the amount of water in the tank will be:

5000 - (500 * 6) = 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

The final answer is: 2000"
"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying popcorn and candy.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He has already spent $8 on popcorn and $8 on candy, so he has $150 - $8 - $8 = $134 left.

Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10. We need to find out how many $10 tickets Colby can buy with $134. 

$134 / $10 = 13.4

Since Colby can't buy a fraction of a ticket, he can buy 13 tickets. 

Now, let's calculate the total number of movies Colby has seen. He has seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, 8 movies on other days, so the total number of movies he has seen is 5 + 8 = 13.

Since Colby can see 13 movies and he has already seen 13 movies, he can't see any more movies."
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, we can calculate the total calories of the pastries:

200 mini cinnamon rolls x 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins x 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked is 85,000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to first find the total number of Junebugs removed.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, which is 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 222

There are 5 days in the period. 

Average Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days

"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus traveled at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 * 5
Distance = 300 miles

The car traveled at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 * 8
Distance = 240 miles

To find the difference in distance, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car
Difference = 300 - 240
Difference = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."

Initial toys: 48
Number of bouncy balls: 62 - 48 = 14

The number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14."
"To solve this problem, we can use the given information to set up a system of equations. Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as A, and Jean's age as J.

From the given information, we have two equations:

1. A = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than Jean)
2. P = A + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age)

We are also given that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old, so we can write the third equation:

P + A + J = 100

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the third equation:

(A + 10) + A + J = 100

Combine like terms:

2A + J + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2A + J = 90

Now, substitute the second equation into the above equation:

2(A + J) + J = 90

Expand and simplify:

2A + 2J + J = 90

Combine like terms:

2A + 3J = 90

Now, we have two equations with two variables:

A = J + 10
2A + 3J = 90

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

2(J + 10) + 3J = 90

Expand and simplify:

2J + 20 + 3J = 90

Combine like terms:

5J + 20 = 90

Subtract 20 from both sides:

5J = 70

Divide both sides by 5:

J = 14

Now that we have found Jean's age, we can find Paul's age using the first equation:

A = J + 10
A = 14 + 10
A = 24

Finally, we can find Peter's age using the second equation:

P = A + J
P = 24 + 14
P = 38

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons each person had and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, each of the 4 friends had 2 balloons, so the total number of balloons they had is 4 x 2 = 8.

Maria also had 2 balloons for herself, so the total number of balloons is 8 + 2 = 10.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (4 friends + Maria), the total number of additional balloons is 5 x 3 = 15.

Now, we add the initial total number of balloons (10) to the additional balloons (15) to get the final total: 10 + 15 = 25.

Therefore, the total number of balloons the girls had is 25.

"To find the total number of boxes of stuff, we need to add the boxes donated by the 10 people and the boxes they already own. 

10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes
50 boxes + 10 boxes = 60 boxes

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find the number of tables needed.

60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

They already have 15 tables, so we subtract this from the total number of tables needed to find the number of new tables required.

30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables

The charity group needs 15 new tables."
"To find the total distance each person spat, we need to multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed was spat.

Zoey's total distance = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet
Sydney's total distance = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet

To find the average total distance, we need to add the total distances and divide by 2.

Average total distance = (Zoey's total distance + Sydney's total distance) / 2
= (400 + 420) / 2
= 820 / 2
= 410 feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine the difference in earnings between the two machines, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month and then multiply that by the selling price of each widget.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month:

Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets
WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 40,800 widgets

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from each machine:

Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 40,800 widgets * $6/widget = $244,800

To find the difference in earnings, subtract the earnings from the WidgetMaster 9000 from the earnings of the Widgeteer 3000:

$259,200 - $244,800 = $14,400

Therefore, Fern will make $14,400 more from the Widgeteer 3000 than from the WidgetMaster 9000 in a month."

"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to calculate the amount each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Sheep's hay = 2 * Goat's hay - 3
Sheep's hay = 2 * 5 - 3
Sheep's hay = 10 - 3
Sheep's hay = 7

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

Total hay for goats = Number of goats * Goat's hay
Total hay for goats = 15 * 5
Total hay for goats = 75

Total hay for sheep = Number of sheep * Sheep's hay
Total hay for sheep = 12 * 7
Total hay for sheep = 84

Now, we can find the total amount of hay needed by adding the hay for goats and sheep:

Total hay needed = Total hay for goats + Total hay for sheep
Total hay needed = 75 + 84
Total hay needed = 159

The final answer is: 159"
"To find out how much John has left after buying the pencils, we need to calculate his total earnings and subtract the expenses.

John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left.

He also buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so the total cost of the pencils is 5 * 10 = 50 dollars.

Now, subtracting the cost of the pencils from his remaining money, John has 250 - 50 = 200 dollars left.

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has 200 - 100 = 100 dollars left.

To find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy, we divide the remaining money by 25: 100 / 25 = 4.

"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. 

The total cost of the CDs is 10 * $15 = $150.

Since James got them for 40% off, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
Discount = 40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60.

So, the total cost after the discount is $150 - $60 = $90.

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each. The total amount he got from selling them is 5 * $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he got from selling the CDs from the total cost after the discount. 
$90 - $200 = -$110.

For carrots: 4 carrots * $1.25 = $5

Total revenue = $9 + $20 + $5 = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's calculate the distance James swims at 2 miles per hour. Since he swims 60% of the total distance, we can calculate the distance he swims as follows:

Distance = 20 miles * 0.6 = 12 miles

Now, let's calculate the time it takes James to swim 12 miles at 2 miles per hour:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

After swimming 12 miles, James rests for half as long as the swimming time. So, he rests for:

Rest time = 6 hours / 2
Rest time = 3 hours

Now, let's calculate the remaining distance James needs to swim:

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance swum
Remaining distance = 20 miles - 12 miles
Remaining distance = 8 miles

Since James swims at half the speed, his new speed is:

New speed = 2 miles per hour / 2
New speed = 1 mile per hour

Now, let's calculate the time it takes James to swim the remaining 8 miles at 1 mile per hour:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

Now, let's add up the time James spent swimming, resting, and swimming again:

Total time = Swimming time + Rest time + Swimming time
Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 17 hours

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to first calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

Since the bakery has 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had, we subtract 40 from 490. 

490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"To find out how many stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to follow the order of events.

Initially, Jasmine had 15 stickers. She lost 7 stickers during playtime, so we subtract 7 from 15: 15 - 7 = 8.

Then, her teacher gave her 5 more stickers for helping her classmates. We add 5 to 8: 8 + 5 = 13.

So, Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.

"To find the total commission, we need to calculate the commission from each newspaper separately and then add them together.

Commission from the New York Times: 
6 copies * $5 * 10% = 6 * 0.1 * 5 = $3

Commission from the Wall Street Journal: 
10 copies * $15 * 8% = 10 * 0.08 * 15 = $12

Total commission = Commission from the New York Times + Commission from the Wall Street Journal
Total commission = $3 + $12
Total commission = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given about the relationships between Marcus, Leo, and Deanna's ages.

Let's denote Marcus's age as M, Leo's age as L, and Deanna's age as D.

We know that Deanna is 26 years old, so D = 26.

We also know that Marcus is half of Leo's age, so M = 0.5L.

Additionally, Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so M = D - 5.

Now we can substitute the value of D into the equation M = D - 5, which gives us M = 26 - 5 = 21.

Since M = 0.5L, we can substitute the value of M into this equation, which gives us 21 = 0.5L.

To find Leo's age, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2, which gives us L = 21 * 2 = 42.

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old.

42"
"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Dinar. 

Let's denote the points scored by Dinar as 'x'. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati scored x + 10 points. 

We know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Azibo scored (x + 10) - 20 points. 

We also know that the total points scored by all three is 45. So, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 10) + (x + 10 - 20) = 45.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 3x = 45.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: x = 15.

Now that we know Dinar scored 15 points, we can find out how many points Azibo scored: Azibo scored (15 + 10) - 20 = 5 points.

"To find the number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book.

Since each paper is printed on both sides, there are 2 pages per inch. 

Now, we multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book: 
2 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 3 pages

The book contains 3 pages."
"To find the total number of reports stapled, we need to calculate the total minutes Vince worked. 

First, we find the total minutes from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM. 
11:00 PM - 8:00 AM = 15 hours
15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we divide the total minutes by 15 to find the total number of 15-minute intervals:
900 minutes / 15 minutes/interval = 60 intervals

Now, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports stapled per interval:
60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports

Therefore, Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether."
"To find the total minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total minutes she slept and subtract the minutes she was awake.

First, let's calculate the total minutes she slept. She usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. 

8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. So, we need to subtract 5 minutes from the total minutes she slept.

480 minutes - 5 minutes = 475 minutes

Now, let's calculate the minutes she was awake. She was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am, which is 23 minutes.

Now, we need to add the minutes she was awake to the total minutes she slept.

475 minutes + 23 minutes = 498 minutes

The final answer is: 498"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan initially has. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has 2 dozen cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

2 dozen cups = 2 * 12 = 24 cups
Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, the number of measuring spoons = 2/3 * 24 = 16

Now, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. To find the total number of utensils remaining, we subtract the number of measuring spoons gifted from the initial number of measuring spoons:

Initial measuring spoons = 16
Measuring spoons gifted = 6
Remaining measuring spoons = 16 - 6 = 10

Jonathan also has 2 dozen cups, which is 24 cups. So, the total number of utensils remaining is the sum of the remaining measuring spoons and cups:

Total utensils remaining = 10 (measuring spoons) + 24 (cups) = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the initial number of occupied beds, we need to calculate 1/5 of the total capacity of the hospital.

1/5 of 1000 beds = (1/5) * 1000 = 200 beds

The initial number of occupied beds is 200.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the number of occupied beds increases by 50 each day.

In 2 weeks (14 days), the number of patients admitted will be 50 * 14 = 700.

The total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks will be 200 + 700 = 900 beds.

The total capacity of the hospital is 1000 beds, so the number of unoccupied beds will be 1000 - 900 = 100 beds.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to break down the information step by step.

First, we know that Robyn sends 7 work emails a day. 

The remainder of the emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the remainder are to family, which is (2/3) * 9 = 6.

The other emails are 9 - 6 = 3.

One-third of the other emails are to her boyfriend, which is (1/3) * 3 = 1.

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the ages of Shawna and her father, and Aliya.

We know that Aliya is 3 years old. Since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, Shawna's age can be calculated as 3 * 3 = 9 years.

Now, we know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. Therefore, Shawna's father's age can be calculated as 5 * 9 = 45 years.

The final answer is 45."
"To find the correct number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from Courtney's number.

First, let's find 20% of 48: 
20% of 48 = (20/100) * 48 = 0.2 * 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from Courtney's number: 
48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the correct number of people who attended the concert is 38.4."
"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. Since Jason carried 2 balls, we can set up an equation to find the number of balls Jeffrey carried. 

Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as x. Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jason carried 2x balls. We know that Jason carried 2 balls, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 2

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 1

This means Jeffrey carried 1 ball. Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jordan carried 2x = 2 * 1 = 2 balls.

Now that we know the number of balls each boy carried, we can find the total number of balls by adding the number of balls each boy carried:

Total number of balls = Jeffrey's balls + Jason's balls + Jordan's balls
= 1 + 2 + 2
= 5

The coach brought 5 basketballs to practice."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day. 

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 31 holes.

Since the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, we can set up the equation 4 * 31 = total holes at the end of the fourth day. 

4 * 31 = 124 holes.

Now, we need to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day. We know that the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 124, and the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 31. 

So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 124 - 31 = 93 holes.

The final answer is: 93"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many corn chips Collins received. Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 15 more than the number the others got, we can represent Collins' amount as 70 + 15 = 85.

Now, we know that the total number of corn chips is the sum of the amounts Amora, Lainey, and Collins received. Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 85, we can add these amounts together to find the total.

70 + 70 + 85 = 225

Therefore, there were 225 corn chips altogether."
"To find the cost of the travel, we need to calculate 50% of the cost of the supplies and add it to the cost of the supplies. 

50% of $400 is 0.5 * 400 = $200. 

The total cost of the travel is the cost of the supplies plus 50% of the cost of the supplies, which is $400 + $200 = $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of Pokémon caught is 339: A + S + X = 339
2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan: X = S + 5
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe: S = 4A - 13

We can substitute the expression for X from equation 2 into equation 1:
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
Combine like terms:
2S + A + 5 = 339

Now, substitute the expression for S from equation 3 into the above equation:
2(4A - 13) + A + 5 = 339
Expand and simplify:
8A - 26 + A + 5 = 339
Combine like terms:
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide both sides by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

The final answer is 147."
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to divide the total minutes per episode by 2, since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. 

Total minutes per episode = 20 minutes
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

Since each episode is 20 minutes long, the total time John will spend watching the show is the total number of episodes multiplied by the length of each episode.

Total time = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time = 10 * 20
Total time = 200 minutes"
"To find the total distance traveled by the bird, we need to calculate the distance covered in each leg of the journey and then add them together.

The bird travels 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the first leg is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 10 = 300 miles

The bird then travels 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the second leg is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 18 * 2 = 36 miles

The bird then travels 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the third leg is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 22 * 5 = 110 miles

To find the total distance traveled, we add the distances covered in each leg:
Total Distance = 300 + 36 + 110 = 446 miles

However, since the bird is traveling in a southerly direction for the first leg and then a northerly direction for the second leg, and finally a southerly direction for the third leg, we need to consider the net displacement. The bird ends up back at her southern home, so the net displacement is 0 miles. 

The total distance traveled is the same as the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes. Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 446 miles."
"To find the total number of brownies Greta had, we need to calculate the number of brownies she received and subtract the number eaten.

She initially made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies, which is 12 brownies.

At her office party, she received 1/2 a dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies.

Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting, which is 48 brownies.

During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

Now, let's add up the total number of brownies she received: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

Then, subtract the number eaten: 66 - 18 = 48 brownies.

So, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day."
"To find the total age of the family members, we need to calculate the age of each member.

Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 8 * 2 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. To find her age, we multiply Nani's age by 0.75 (which is 75% in decimal form). So, her age is 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we add up the ages of all three family members: 8 (Nani) + 16 (brother) + 6 (sister) = 30 years.

The total age of the family members is 30 years."

"To find the total number of players in both teams, we need to add the number of players in Zeke's team to the number of players in Carlton's team. 

Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, we can represent the number of players in Zeke's team as 13 + 7 = 20.

Now, we add the number of players in both teams: 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33.

The total number of players in both teams is 33."
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2(length + width).

In this case, the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet. 

Perimeter = 2(15 + 10) 
Perimeter = 2(25) 
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2.

Total number of slats = Perimeter * 2 
Total number of slats = 50 * 2 
Total number of slats = 100

"To find the total number of states in both countries, we need to first determine the number of states in the USA and India.

The USA has 50 states.

Since India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we can calculate the number of states in India as follows:

Half of 50 is 25.
25 + 4 = 29

So, India has 29 states.

Now, we can find the total number of states in both countries by adding the number of states in the USA and India:

50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79

The total number of states in both countries is 79."
"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy. 

The total cost of the items is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has saved $14, we need to subtract this from the total cost to find out how much more he needs to earn. 

$39 (total cost) - $14 (saved) = $25 (amount still needed)

Now, we can divide the amount still needed by Tyler's hourly wage to find out how many hours he needs to work. 

$25 (amount still needed) ÷ $5 (hourly wage) = 5 hours

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we need to first determine how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries, we can set up an equation: 

Let's denote the number of cherries Richard has as 'x'. 
Since Robert has 10 more than Richard, we can write the equation as: 
x + 10 = 30

Solving for x, we get: 
x = 30 - 10 
x = 20 

So, Richard has 20 cherries. 

Now, to find out how many cherries Jerry has, we subtract the number of cherries Richard has from the total number of cherries: 
60 - 20 = 40 

So, Jerry has 40 cherries. 

To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has: 
30 - 40 = -10 

However, since we can't have a negative number of cherries, this means that Robert actually has fewer cherries than Jerry."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of boxes sold on each day and then multiply it by the respective cost of each item.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. 
Let's assume the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday is x. 
Then, the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday is x - 4.

On Sunday, Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday. 
So, the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday is 10 + 5 = 15.

We know that the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday is 15, so we can set up an equation for the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday:
x - 4 = 15
x = 19

Now that we know the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday, we can calculate the total number of boxes sold on each day:
Saturday: 10 (gingerbread) + (x - 4) (apple pie) = 10 + 15 = 25
Sunday: 15 (gingerbread) + 19 (apple pie) = 34

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for each day:
Saturday: 10 * $6 = $60
Sunday: 34 * $15 = $510

Total earnings for two days: $60 + $510 = $570

The final answer is: $570"

"To solve this problem, let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

We are given that Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = D/2. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get D = 48.

We are also given that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B. Dividing both sides by 2, we get B = 12.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now. We already know D = 48 and B = 12, so the sum of their ages is D + B = 48 + 12 = 60.

"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads each person gave her and then add them together.

Her mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day and add them together.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the total amount of crawfish Joe caught:

3 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) + 6 (Saturday) = 21 pounds

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings:

"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of students in each group and then add them together.

First, we find the number of football players: 20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after removing the football players: 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, we find the number of cheerleaders or band members: 25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. 

Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

The average size of the two shoes is the sum of their sizes divided by 2. 

Average size = (5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15.

"To determine the total cost, we first need to find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed. 

First, we need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches: 
111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Now, we need to subtract the space between the plants from the total length of the flower bed. 
Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we need to convert the space between the plants from feet to inches: 
1.5 feet * 12 inches/foot = 18 inches

Now, we can subtract the space between the plants from the total length of the flower bed: 
1332 inches - 18 inches = 1314 inches

Since each plant is 12 inches wide, we can divide the remaining space by the width of each plant to find out how many plants Pat can fit: 
1314 inches / 12 inches = 109.5

Since Pat can't fit a fraction of a plant, we round down to 109 plants.

Now, we can multiply the number of plants by the cost of each plant to find the total cost: 
109 plants * $6/plant = $654

The final answer is: $654"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to first find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. 

Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, we can multiply Edgar's daily pretzel consumption by 1/2. 

Edgar's brother eats 18 * 1/2 = 9 pretzels a day.

To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply his daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week).

The cost of petunias: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00

The cost of sweet potato vines: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00

Total cost = cost of petunias + cost of sweet potato vines = $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

The total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is $70.00."
"To find out how many roses they can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds each = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds each = 15 pounds

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds

Now, subtract the total amount of soil used for sunflowers and carnations from the total amount of soil they bought:

30 pounds (total) - 27 pounds (used) = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses."
"To find out how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income.

25% of $2,000.00 = 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00

Since she sets aside $500.00 each month, we can calculate how many months she can afford to buy shoes in a year.

$500.00 / $1,000.00 = 0.5

Since she can afford to buy 0.5 pairs of shoes per month, we can multiply this by 12 to find out how many pairs she can buy in a year.

0.5 * 12 = 6

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"To find the time it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to first find out how long it takes her to peel and cook 30 shrimp, and then multiply that time by 3.

Since Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can assume that the time it takes her to peel and cook 30 shrimp is also 10 minutes.

Now, to find the time it takes to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we multiply the time it takes to peel and cook 30 shrimp by 3:

10 minutes * 3 = 30 minutes

Therefore, it will take Emily 30 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net cooling effect of the air conditioner.

The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. 

First, let's calculate the total cooling effect when the air conditioner is on low for 3 hours:
3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees

Then, let's calculate the total cooling effect when the air conditioner is on high for 4 hours:
4 hours * 3 degrees/hour = 12 degrees

The net cooling effect is the difference between the cooling effects:
12 degrees - 6 degrees = 6 degrees

Since the room warms up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running, we need to calculate the warming effect for the 2 hours the air conditioner was off:
2 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 4 degrees

Now, we subtract the warming effect from the net cooling effect to find the final temperature difference:
6 degrees - 4 degrees = 2 degrees

The final temperature is 2 degrees lower than the starting temperature."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as 'x'. 

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old, and the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can set up the following equation:

x + 75 = 30 + 3(30)

This equation represents the fact that Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was three times his father's age at the time of the first sighting.

Simplifying the equation:

x + 75 = 90

Subtracting 75 from both sides:

x = 15

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks he writes per month and then multiply it by 12.

1. Checks for electric bill: 1 check per month
2. Checks for gas bill: 1 check per month
3. Checks to the church: 2 checks per month
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 4 checks per year (since there are 4 quarters in a year)

Total checks per month: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 checks
Total checks per year: 4 checks/month * 12 months/year = 48 checks/year

Buford writes 48 checks per year."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of flights made by the first plane in a day. 

Since the second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips in a day.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so it goes to Greece for 88 * (3/4) = 66 trips.

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. This means the first plane makes 88 - 66 = 22 trips to either France or Germany.

Since the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the first plane makes 22 / 2 = 11 trips to France in a day.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the combined length of time, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we need to convert the total duration from seconds to minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we divide the total duration by 60.

Total duration in minutes = (20 + 40 + 60) / 60 = 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents.

Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is 2 * $6 = $12. 

So, the total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since Adam bought the trousers for $30, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the total cost to find out how much he had to contribute from his savings.

$30 (total cost) - $18 (amount received from parents) = $12

Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to find the average age of the group. We know the total age of the children is 20 and Akbar and Alessandro's ages are 3 and 4, respectively. 

Let's denote Helene's age as H and Wilfred's age as W. We are given that Helene is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. 

So, the average age of the group is 20 / 4 = 5. 

Since Helene is twice the average age, H = 2 * 5 = 10. 

Now, we know the total age of the children is 20, and we have the ages of Akbar (3), Alessandro (4), and Helene (10). 

We can set up an equation to find Wilfred's age: 
3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20 
17 + W = 20 
W = 3 

The age of Wilfred is 3."
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Walter has collected so far.

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, we need to find out how much his lawyer will contribute after Walter's friend gives him $200.

Let's assume Walter's friend's contribution is x. Then, the total amount collected will be $2000 + x + 3x (since Walter's lawyer will contribute three times as much as everyone else).

We know that Walter's friend gives him $200, so the total amount collected will be $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Now, we can set up an equation: 2200 = 2000 + 3x

Subtracting 2000 from both sides, we get 200 = 3x

Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 66.67

Since Walter's lawyer will contribute three times as much as everyone else, the lawyer's contribution will be 3x = 3 * 66.67 = $200.

The final answer is $200."
"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to calculate half of the total number of cookies. 

Total number of cookies = 100 guests * 15 cookies per guest = 1500 cookies

Half of the cookies = 1500 cookies / 2 = 750 cookies

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies given to the church by 15 to find the number of people in the church.

Number of people in the church = 750 cookies / 15 cookies per person = 50 people

The final answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of slices. Since there are 6 family members and each adult gets a slice twice as big as each kid, let's assume the number of slices for the kids is 'x'. Then, the number of slices for the adults would be '2x'.

The total number of slices would be x + 2x = 3x.

Since the total number of family members is 6, we can set up the equation 3x = 6. Solving for x, we get x = 2.

So, the number of slices for the kids is 2, and the number of slices for the adults is 4.

Now, let's assume the total weight of the watermelon is W. The weight of each slice is W/3x. 

The weight of each adult's slice is W/3x, and the weight of each kid's slice is W/6x.

Since each adult gets a slice twice as big as each kid, the weight of each adult's slice is 2 * (W/6x) = W/3x.

The total weight of the watermelon is the sum of the weights of all slices, which is 3x * (W/3x) = W.

Now, the weight of each adult's slice is W/3x, and the total weight of the watermelon is W. 

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we can divide the weight of each adult's slice by the total weight of the watermelon and multiply by 100.

Percentage of watermelon each adult gets = (W/3x) / W * 100 = (1/3) * 100 = 33.33%

The final answer is 33.33."
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes
Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest start time, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake. 

The total time required is the sum of the time to make the batter, bake the cake, cool the cake, and frost the cake. 

Time to make the batter = 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake = 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake = 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake = 10 minutes

Total time = 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes: 
180 minutes = 3 hours

Now, we need to subtract the total time from the desired serving time to find the latest start time. 
Desired serving time = 5:00 pm
Total time = 3 hours

Latest start time = 5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, Jordan should start making the cake by 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

"To find the number of chocolate bars in a box, we need to first find the total number of boxes sold by both Lisa and Peter. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. 

Total boxes sold = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

We know that together they sold 64 chocolate bars. 

Let's assume the number of chocolate bars in a box is 'x'. 

Then, the total number of chocolate bars sold is 8x. 

Since they sold 64 chocolate bars together, we can set up the equation: 

8x = 64

To solve for 'x', we divide both sides by 8:

x = 64 / 8
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

64"
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total revenue from the students.

The cost of renting the studio per week is $25. Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the weekly cost is $25 * 3 = $75.

The cost of renting the studio per month is $75 * 4 = $300.

The cost of renting the studio per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the weekly cost is $1.50 * 10 = $15.

The weekly revenue from the students is $15 * 3 = $45.

The weekly revenue from the students is $45. The monthly revenue from the students is $45 * 4 = $180.

The total monthly earnings of the dance studio is the sum of the cost of renting the studio and the revenue from the students, which is $300 + $180 = $480.

"To find the number of chocolate bars in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars each person has by the number of boxes they have.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 64 / 4 = 16.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 56 / 7 = 8.

To find the difference, subtract the number of chocolate bars in each box of Martha from the number of chocolate bars in each box of Peter: 16 - 8 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population.

Number of female porcupines = 3/5 * 50 = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of new porcupines added each month is 30 * 4 = 120.

To find the total number of new porcupines added in a year, we multiply this by 12 (months in a year).

Total new porcupines in a year = 120 * 12 = 1440

Now, we add the initial population and the total new porcupines to find the final population.

Final population = Initial population + Total new porcupines
= 50 + 1440
= 1490

The final answer is: 1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the rectangular prism formed by the pool. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is V = length * width * height. 

Given the dimensions of the pool (14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep), we can calculate the volume as follows:

V = length * width * height
V = 25 * 14 * 4
V = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the total gallons of water needed, we multiply the volume by 5.9:

1400 * 5.9 = 8230 gallons

The cost for the pool company to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. To find the total cost, we multiply the total gallons of water needed by the cost per gallon:

8230 * 0.10 = $823

The total cost to fill the pool is $823."
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to first find the number of blue sticks and then the number of yellow sticks.

We know there are 9 red sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 + 14 + 11 = 34.

The total number of sticks is 34."
"To find the distance traveled by Matteo, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles.

To find the distance traveled by Shandy, we multiply her speed by the time she traveled: 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles.

Now, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance to find the difference: 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles.

The difference in distance traveled between Shandy and Matteo is 230 miles."
"To find the number of female students, we need to break down the information given.

First, let's find the number of students over 16 years old: 
Half of 3000 students are over 16 years old, so 3000 / 2 = 1500 students are over 16 years old.

One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, so the number of male students over 16 years old is 1500 / 4 = 375.

Now, let's find the number of students under 16 years old: 
The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, so 3000 / 2 = 1500 students are under 16 years old.

One-half of the students under 16 years old are male, so the number of male students under 16 years old is 1500 / 2 = 750.

Now, we can find the number of female students over 16 years old: 
1500 (total students over 16) - 375 (male students over 16) = 1125 female students over 16 years old.

Now, we can find the number of female students under 16 years old: 
1500 (total students under 16) - 750 (male students under 16) = 750 female students under 16 years old.

To find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 years old and under 16 years old: 
1125 (female students over 16) + 750 (female students under 16) = 1875.

The final answer is: 1875"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many laps each person can run and then compare Bethany's laps to Quinn's.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's laps from Bethany's laps: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on each day.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped over the two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the amount of water remaining is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we can break it down into two parts: the first part where the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour, and the second part where it loses 7% of its capacity per hour.

Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as x.

In the first part, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour for 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:

x - (9% of x) * 5
= x - 0.09x * 5
= x - 0.45x
= 0.55x

In the second part, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity per hour for 3 hours. This means that after 3 hours, the charge remaining is:

0.55x - (7% of 0.55x) * 3
= 0.55x - 0.07 * 0.55x * 3
= 0.55x - 0.1025x
= 0.4475x

We are given that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 28%. So, we can set up the equation:

0.4475x = 0.28

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.4475:

x = 0.28 / 0.4475
x = 0.628

So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 62.8%."
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we first need to calculate her total weekly income from wages and tips. 

Her weekly income from wages is $10/hour * 40 hours/week = $400/week. 
Her weekly income from tips is $15/hour * 40 hours/week = $600/week. 
So, her total weekly income is $400/week + $600/week = $1000/week.

Now, we need to calculate 20% of the cost of the car, which is 20% of $10,000 = 0.2 * $10,000 = $2,000.

To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save $2,000, we divide the amount she needs to save by her weekly income: $2,000 / $1000/week = 2 weeks.

Therefore, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he has spent on other fruits.

The cost of peaches is 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
The cost of pears is 4 * $0.75 = $3
The cost of kiwis is 2 * $1 = $2
The total cost of these fruits is $1.5 + $3 + $2 = $6.5

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $6.5 = $3.5 left.

Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can divide $3.5 by $0.25 to find out how many plums he can buy: $3.5 / $0.25 = 14.

Jamaar can buy 14 plums."
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we need to first calculate the total number of sweets in the box. 

There are 15 packs in the box, and each pack has 60 pieces. 

Total number of sweets = 15 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 900 pieces

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends = 15 packs - 2 packs = 13 packs

Since each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of pieces given to her friends = 13 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 780 pieces

Now, we need to divide the total number of pieces given to her friends by the number of friends (10) to find out how many pieces each friend received.

Number of pieces per friend = 780 pieces / 10 friends = 78 pieces

The final answer is 78."
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years, we need to apply the 5% annual increase to the initial price of $120 for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial price = $120
Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Initial price = $126
Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Initial price = $132.30
Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide 72 by 8 to get the number of pictures per album. 

72 ÷ 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies only, and each album has 9 pictures, the number of selfies is 3 * 9 = 27.

The remaining albums are portraits, and we know there are 2 portraits. 

The number of portraits is 9 - 3 = 6.

So, Olivia had 6 portraits and 27 selfies.

"To find the total time James spends reading, we need to first determine the time it takes him to read one page. 

Since it takes James 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can divide 10 minutes by 3 pages to get the time it takes to read one page. 

10 minutes / 3 pages = 3.33 minutes per page

Now, we can multiply the time it takes to read one page by the total number of pages James read, which is 18 pages.

3.33 minutes per page * 18 pages = 60 minutes

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of guests who checked in and subtract the number of guests who checked out.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.

24 guests checked out, leaving 100 - 24 = 76 guests.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, so the number of guests who checked out is 24 (early) + 15 (late) = 39.

Now, we know that twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 people opted for a late checkout, 2 * 15 = 30 people checked in.

Additionally, 7 more people checked in after dinner was served.

So, the total number of guests who checked in is 30 (in the afternoon) + 7 (after dinner) = 37.

Now, we can calculate the total number of guests in the hotel: 
100 (initial guests) - 39 (guests who checked out) + 37 (guests who checked in) = 98.

The hotel now has 98 guests."

Now, let's add the bananas: 4 + 6 + 12 = 22

John has 22 bananas in total."
"To find the number of easy questions, we can calculate 40% of 60, which is 0.4 * 60 = 24 questions. 

Since the rest of the questions are divided equally between average and difficult, we have 60 - 24 = 36 questions left. These are divided equally, so there are 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 0.75 * 24 = 18 questions. 

She is also sure to get half of the average questions, which is 0.5 * 18 = 9 questions. 

So, she is sure to get 18 + 9 = 27 questions.

The final answer is 27."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as L and the number of small stuffed animals sold as S. We know that S = 2L (since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones).

We also know that the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal, so the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total amount earned from the sales is $120. Since the price of a large stuffed animal is $12, the total amount earned from large stuffed animals is 12L. The total amount earned from small stuffed animals is 4S (since each small stuffed animal costs $4).

We can set up the equation:

12L + 4S = 120

Substituting S = 2L into the equation, we get:

12L + 4(2L) = 120
12L + 8L = 120
20L = 120

Dividing both sides by 20, we get:

L = 6

Since S = 2L, we can find S by multiplying L by 2:

S = 2 * 6
S = 12

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

"To find the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in one week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten per day and then multiply it by 7.

The total number of sandwiches eaten per day is: 
5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day.

Now, multiply the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by 7:
11 sandwiches/day * 7 days = 77 sandwiches.

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings first. 

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 * $1 = $80.
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 * $4 = $240.

Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave away a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

Now, we subtract the amount she gave away from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings."
"To find the number of eggs the friends found, we need to subtract the number of eggs the Smith twins found and the number of eggs that were not found by their friends from the total number of eggs.

The Smith twins found 30 eggs each, so together they found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

There were 100 eggs in total, and 10 eggs were not found by their friends. So, the number of eggs found by their friends is 100 - 60 - 10 = 30.

The friends found 30 eggs."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. 

Since one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands, he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day with an iron pickaxe. 

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds per day. 

Now, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes. 

40 dwarves can mine 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds of ore per day. 

To find out how much ore they can mine in a month (30 days), we multiply the daily amount by 30. 

1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds of ore."
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to establish the price per sandwich for the first two packages. 

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.50.

The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.50.

Since the prices are proportional, we can assume that the price per sandwich remains the same for all packages. 

Now, we can calculate the price of the package with 8 sandwiches by multiplying the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches: $1.50 * 8 = $12.

The final answer is $12."
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to calculate the remaining amount he owes after using the $1000 he received from selling his old bedroom.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount received from selling the old bedroom: $1000
Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we can calculate the monthly payment as follows:

Monthly payment = 10% of $2000
= 0.10 * $2000
= $200

The final answer is: $200"
"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons she had after each event.

Initially, she had 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 
Number of red balloons that burst = 40% of 25 = 0.4 * 25 = 10
Number of red balloons remaining = 25 - 10 = 15

Then, she released half of the yellow balloons. 
Number of yellow balloons released = 1/2 * 12 = 6
Number of yellow balloons remaining = 12 - 6 = 6

She found 8 blue balloons in the tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 
Number of blue balloons added = 75% of 8 = 0.75 * 8 = 6
Number of blue balloons remaining = 8 + 6 = 14
Total number of balloons = 15 (red) + 6 (yellow) + 14 (blue) = 35

The final number of balloons Sally carried into the school is 35."
"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the following scenarios:

1. The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 60% (100% - 40% chance of extension)
2. The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 60% (100% - 40% chance of no extension)
3. The substitute teacher comes in: 100% (no chance of extension)

Now, let's calculate the probability of each scenario:

Scenario 1: Normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36
Scenario 2: Normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24
Scenario 3: Substitute teacher comes in: 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.10

Now, we add up the probabilities of each scenario: 0.36 + 0.24 + 0.10 = 0.70

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.70 * 100 = 70%

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 70%."
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to subtract the total number of reserved seats from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Total capacity = 6000
Reserved seats for graduates = 950
Reserved seats for faculty = 300
Total reserved seats = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now, subtract the total reserved seats from the total capacity:
6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates:
4750 / 950 = 5

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of large, medium, and small jelly beans. 

We know that it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, the number of medium-sized beans is 2 * 75 = 150.

We also know that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean. Therefore, the number of small beans that equals 1 medium-sized bean is 3. To find the total number of small beans that equals 150 medium-sized beans, we multiply 150 by 3, which gives us 450.

So, Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly beans.

450"
"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total daily earnings and then subtract her parking expenses. 

Her daily earnings are $15 per day. Since she spends 3 days, her total earnings are 15 * 3 = $45. 

Her parking expenses are $3 per day, so for 3 days, her total parking expenses are 3 * 3 = $9.

Now, we subtract her parking expenses from her total earnings: 45 - 9 = $36.

To find out how much she makes per hour, we divide her total earnings after expenses by the number of hours she worked: 36 / 6 = $6.

The final answer is $6."
"To find the total amount Ted spent, we need to calculate the cost of the books and pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 books at 16 dollars each is 3 x 16 = 48 dollars.

The cost of 3 pencils at 6 dollars each is 3 x 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the books and pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

Ted spent a total of 66 dollars."
"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can place along the driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes to move from one bottle to the next.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the width of the driveway by the spacing between the bottles:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

The final answer is: 35"
"To find the total number of packs of apples Uncle Franky can make, we need to multiply the number of apples in one box by the number of boxes he ordered.

Number of apples in one box = 40
Number of boxes = 2

Total number of apples = 40 * 2 = 80

Since each pack contains 8 apples, we can divide the total number of apples by 8 to find the number of packs.

Number of packs = Total number of apples / 8
= 80 / 8
= 10

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the two boxes of apples."
"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought and subtract it from her initial $50.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 * $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 * $6 = $18.

Total cost of cheese = $22 + $18 = $40.

Now, subtract the total cost of cheese from her initial $50:
$50 - $40 = $10.

Amor will have $10 left to buy meat."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school and the total amount of money he earned after graduating.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school. Since it takes him 4 years to finish college and he gets $50,000 in loans per year, the total amount of money he lost is:

$50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim earned after graduating. Since his college degree tripled his income, and he had a $25,000/year job before college, his new income is:

$25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year

Since he worked for 4 years after graduating, the total amount of money he earned is:

$75,000/year * 4 years = $300,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay off the loans and the money lost while in school. This is the sum of the total amount of money he lost and the total amount of money he earned:

$200,000 (lost) + $300,000 (earned) = $500,000

To find out how long it would take Jim to earn this amount, we can divide the total amount by his new income:

$500,000 / $75,000/year = 6.67 years

So, it would take Jim approximately 6.67 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

$200,000"
"To find the total amount of fabric needed, we need to calculate the area of the comforter. 

First, we need to find the dimensions of the fabric. Since the comforter is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, the dimensions of the fabric will be (6 + 2) feet by (8 + 2) feet, which is 8 feet by 10 feet.

The area of the fabric is calculated by multiplying the length and width, so the area is 8 * 10 = 80 square feet.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. 
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery. 
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Now, let's add the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736

The post office delivered 736 letters from Monday to Wednesday."
"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

The cost of the chicken salad is 10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.

"To find the average amount Johnny lost, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

In the first race, he lost $5.

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Since he lost $5 in the first race, he won $2 * $5 + $1 = $11 in the second race.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. Since he won $11 in the second race, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50 in the third race.

Now, let's calculate the total amount he lost: $5 (first race) + $16.50 (third race) = $21.50

To find the average amount he lost, we divide the total amount by the number of races: $21.50 / 3 = $7.17

The average amount Johnny lost that day is $7.17."
"To find the total population of South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then multiply that by the population of each city.

Number of countries in South America = 26
Number of cities in each country = 5
Population of each city = 1000

Total population = Number of countries * Number of cities in each country * Population of each city
Total population = 26 * 5 * 1000
Total population = 130,000

The total population of South America is 130,000."
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their new heights after the growth.

Xavier's new height = original height + growth
Xavier's new height = 4 feet + 3 inches
Since 1 foot = 12 inches, we convert 4 feet to inches: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches
Xavier's new height = 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Cole's new height = original height + growth
Cole's new height = 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Now, we find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier:
Difference in height = Cole's new height - Xavier's new height
Difference in height = 52 inches - 51 inches
Difference in height = 1 inch

The final answer is 1."
"To find the share of the first person, we need to first find the amount taken by the second and third person.

Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as x. 

The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the amount taken by the second person is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the amount taken by the third person is 2(x + 80).

The sum of the amounts taken by all three people is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 576.67

So, the first person took $576.67.

The final answer is: $576.67"
"To find the total hours of work done by the team, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters.

First, let's calculate the total hours worked by the team. Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks, we need to convert the fraction to a decimal and multiply it by the number of days in 3 weeks.

There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is 3 x 7 = 21 days.

3/8 of a day is equivalent to 0.375 days.

Total hours worked by the team = 0.375 days x 21 days = 7.875 days

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can convert the total hours worked to hours:
7.875 days x 24 hours/day = 189 hours

Now, we need to divide the total hours worked by the number of painters to find the hours worked by each painter:
189 hours ÷ 4 painters = 47.25 hours

The final answer is 47.25."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is 'x + 4'. 

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is 'x/2'.

We know that the total number of balls retrieved is 19. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Expanding the equation:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know 'x', we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set of the match.

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Initial price of the car in 2007: $20,000
Depreciation rate: 21% per year

Year 2008:
Depreciation = 21% of $20,000 = 0.21 * $20,000 = $4,200
Price in 2008 = $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800

Year 2009:
Depreciation = 21% of $15,800 = 0.21 * $15,800 = $3,318
Price in 2009 = $15,800 - $3,318 = $12,482

Year 2010:
Depreciation = 21% of $12,482 = 0.21 * $12,482 = $2,616.42
Price in 2010 = $12,482 - $2,616.42 = $9,865.58

The price of the car in 2010 is $9,865.58."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to find the total number of books written in English and German. 

Half of the 50 books are written in English, so the number of English books is 50 / 2 = 25.

10% of the 50 books are written in German, so the number of German books is 0.1 * 50 = 5.

Now, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books to find the number of Spanish books: 50 - 25 - 5 = 20.

Therefore, there are 20 Spanish books in the library.

"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first calculate the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Since Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day, we multiply the number of cups she drinks per day by the number of days: 
8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups

Now, we need to convert the total number of cups to gallons. Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we divide the total number of cups by 16:
240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to calculate the number of people on the train after each stop.

Initially, there were 120 people on the train.

At the first stop, 20 more people boarded the train, so the total number of people became 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people descended from the train, and 50 * 2 = 100 people boarded the train. So, the total number of people became 140 + 100 - 50 = 190.

At the third stop, 80 more people descended from the train, so the total number of people became 190 - 80 = 110.

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110.

"To find the total cost of the athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The tank top costs $10.
The pair of running shorts costs $5 more than the tank top, so it costs $10 + $5 = $15.
The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
The package of athletic socks originally costs $8, but Alison had a coupon for $2 off, so the socks cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55.

The total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is $55."
"To find the total cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and then multiply it by the cost per tile.

The area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt, and each tile is 1ft x 1ft, so the area of each tile is 1 SqFt. 

To find the total number of tiles required, we divide the total area of the kitchen floor by the area of each tile:

200 SqFt / 1 SqFt = 200 tiles

Now, we multiply the total number of tiles by the cost per tile:

200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400

Therefore, it will cost $2400 to renovate your kitchen floor."
"To find the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

60% of $120 is 0.6 * 120 = $72. 

The increased cost is $120 + $72 = $192. 

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we multiply the increased cost by 12. 

$192 * 12 = $2304.

"To determine the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the total number of sets of sheets he needs to wash per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. So, the total number of sets of sheets he needs to wash per week is:

4 twin sets + 1 king set = 5 sets

Since his laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, he needs to do:

- 2 twin sets / 2 = 1 load for twin sets
- 1 king set / 1 = 1 load for king sets

So, he needs to do 2 loads per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year. Therefore, the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year is:

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many slices each person ate and then add them up.

We know Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can set up an equation to find out how many slices Jake ate:

Let x be the number of slices Jake ate.
Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so Becky ate x + 3 slices.
We know Becky ate 10 slices, so x + 3 = 10.
Solving for x, we get x = 7.

Now that we know Jake ate 7 slices, we can find out how many slices Silvia ate. Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices each person ate:
Becky ate 10 slices.
Jake ate 7 slices.
Silvia ate 14 slices.
Total slices eaten = 10 + 7 + 14 = 31.

"To solve this problem, let's denote Donovan's part as 'x'. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part can be represented as 'x + 18'. 

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 18) = 98.

Combine like terms: 2x + 18 = 98.

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

Since Betsy's part is x + 18, we can substitute x with 40: 40 + 18 = 58.

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of the cast, the visit, the painkillers, and the parking.

1. The cost of the cast is $200.
2. The visit is 30 minutes, which is half an hour. The doctor charges $300/hour, so the cost of the visit is $300/2 = $150.
3. The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill, and Hannah needs 30 painkillers, so the cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.
4. The cost of the parking is $6/hour, and Hannah needs to pay for 2 hours, so the cost of the parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up the costs: $200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."

"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes that visited each day and then add them together.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add the number of classes that visited each day:
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247

Therefore, a total of 247 classes visited the Science Center last week.

"To find the average score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of tests. 

First, let's add up the scores: 
100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380

Now, we divide the total score by the number of tests: 
380 / 4 = 95

The average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"To find out how many pizzas are left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas each group ate and subtract that from the total number of pizzas.

The glee club ate 70% of 20 pizzas, which is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas.

The football team ate 80% of twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 80% of 40 pizzas is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas eaten is 14 (glee club) + 32 (football team) = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

To find the number of pizzas left, we subtract the total number eaten from the total number ordered: 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

"To find the total postage cost, we need to calculate the number of small and big coupons first. 

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons, so he will send out 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.

The total number of coupons is 700 + 1400 = 2100.

The cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.
The cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

The total cost of mailing is 3500 + 21000 = 26200 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 26200 / 100 = 262 dollars.

The total postage cost is 262 dollars."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means he ordered 10 - 3 = 7 sub sandwiches.

Then, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, leaving 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches.

Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining 3 sub sandwiches is 3 * 4 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of trucks that could not deliver the fertiliser, we need to calculate a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched. 

A quarter of 20 trucks is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered is 5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons.

The total number of trucks that could deliver the fertiliser is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons.

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons."
"To determine the cost of the butter, we first need to calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs. Since he needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store has a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every two pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds. 

To calculate the cost, we can divide the total amount of butter needed (6 pounds) by 2, since the promotion is for every two pounds. 6 / 2 = 3. 

Since Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds of butter for every 2 pounds, and he needs 6 pounds, he will pay for 3 sets of 1.5 pounds. 

The cost of 1.5 pounds of butter is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00. Since he is buying 3 sets of 1.5 pounds, the total cost will be 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.

The final answer is $6.00."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of guests first. Kayla invited 25 classmates and 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members, for a total of 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests. However, 4 people said they couldn't come, so the actual number of guests is 45 - 4 = 41.

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. Since there are 41 guests, we need to calculate the cost for the additional guests: 41 - 20 = 21 additional guests. The cost for the additional guests is 21 * $6 = $126.

The total cost is the initial fee plus the cost for the additional guests: $125 + $126 = $251.

"To find out how much money Maggie and Riza have left, we need to first determine how much money they initially had. Since they each had $60, the total amount of money they had is $60 + $60 = $120.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 * $60 = $15. 
Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 * $60 = $20.

The total amount of money they spent is $15 + $20 = $35.

To find out how much money they have left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $120 - $35 = $85.

The two of them have $85 left."
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine the total number of bananas each monkey eats in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. 
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

Since the total number of bananas is 315, we can subtract the bananas eaten by the first two monkeys to find out how many bananas are left for the third monkey.

The first two monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas per day. 
315 - 24 = 291 bananas left for the third monkey.

Since the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day, the third monkey eats 291 bananas per day."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed in the given time frame. 

Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle, which is 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. 

Then, he finished another 500-piece puzzle within the same hour. 

So, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed in that hour is 250 + 500 = 750 pieces.

"To find out how many quarters Jenny will leave with, we first need to calculate the total cost of the roses. 

Since a dozen roses cost $15, 15 roses will cost 15 * 1.25 = $18.75. 

Jenny has 5 dollars, so she needs to pay $18.75 - $5 = $13.75. 

Since the florist only accepts quarters for change, we need to convert $13.75 to quarters. 

There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so 13 dollars is 13 * 4 = 52 quarters. 

The remaining 75 cents is equivalent to 0.75 * 4 = 3 quarters. 

Therefore, Jenny will leave with 52 + 3 = 55 quarters."
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the revenue from each item and add them together.

Revenue from milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50 = $33
Revenue from burger platters: 9 platters * $11 = $99
Revenue from sodas: 20 sodas * $1.50 = $30

Total revenue = $33 + $99 + $30 = $162

"To determine the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the time elapsed between the first train's arrival and the fourth train's departure.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the time elapsed until the second train arrives is 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves, which means it arrives 30 minutes after the first train's scheduled arrival time. Since the first train arrives in 10 minutes, the second train arrives at 10 + 30 = 40 minutes.

3. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 40 + 20 = 60 minutes.

4. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which means it arrives 60 minutes after the second train's scheduled arrival time. Since the second train arrives at 40 minutes, the third train arrives at 40 + 60 = 100 minutes.

5. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which means it arrives 20 minutes after the third train's scheduled departure time. Since the third train leaves at 100 minutes, the fourth train arrives at 100 + 20 = 120 minutes.

Now, we need to calculate the total waiting time for Paul. He waits for the first train to arrive (10 minutes), then waits for the second train to arrive (30 minutes), then waits for the third train to arrive (60 minutes), and finally waits for the fourth train to arrive (20 minutes). 

Total waiting time = 10 + 30 + 60 + 20 = 120 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we need to first determine how many toothpicks she has already collected. 

Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has collected is 10 * 12 = 120.

Since she needs 200 toothpicks in total, we subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total: 200 - 120 = 80.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks at the same rate of 10 toothpicks per week. 

To do this, we divide the remaining toothpicks by the number of toothpicks she saves per week: 80 / 10 = 8.

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks.

80"
"To find the original price of the watch, we need to calculate 75% of the original price. 

Let's assume the original price is x. 
75% of x = 0.75x
Since Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, we can set up the equation:
0.75x = 2000
To find x, we divide both sides by 0.75:
x = 2000 / 0.75
x = 2666.67

Now, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it. 
120% of 2666.67 = 1.2 * 2666.67 = 3200

The original price of the watch was 2666.67, and Mr. Rogers sold it to his friend for 3200. 
The discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend is the difference between the original price and the selling price:
Discount = Original price - Selling price
= 2666.67 - 3200
= -533.33

However, since we are looking for the percentage discount, we need to express it as a positive value. 
Percentage discount = (Discount / Original price) * 100
= (-533.33 / 2666.67) * 100
= -20%

The negative sign indicates that the friend actually paid more than the original price, not obtained a discount."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of jellyfish created by each spring in 4 hours and then multiply it by the number of springs.

Since a spring creates a new jellyfish every second, we can calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours as follows:

1 hour = 60 minutes
1 minute = 60 seconds
So, 1 hour = 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds

Number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours = 3600 seconds/hour * 4 hours = 14400 jellyfish

Since there are 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created in 4 hours would be:

Total jellyfish = 5 springs * 14400 jellyfish/spring = 72000 jellyfish

The final answer is: 72000"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score and then add 15 to it. 

Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180. 

Now, we add 15 to this result: 180 + 15 = 195.

So, Frankie's score was 195."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it took James to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.

Since James walked halfway to the store, the distance to the store is 4 miles, so the distance he walked to the store is half of that, which is 2 miles. 

The time it took him to walk to the store is the distance divided by his speed, which is 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours.

Now, he has to walk back home, which is another 2 miles. The time it took him to walk back home is also 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours.

The total time it took James to reach the store is the sum of the time it took him to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home, which is 0.5 hours + 0.5 hours = 1 hour.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the bananas individually and the total cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's calculate the total cost of buying the bananas individually. Since there are 10 bunches with 4 bananas per bunch, the total number of bananas is 10 * 4 = 40. The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Since Jenny bought 10 bunches, the total cost would be 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

Now, we can find the amount of money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total amount of fence that Sam and Harry will get. Since they are splitting the fence, we can represent the amount of fence Sam gets as 'x'. Then, Harry gets 'x + 60'. 

Since the total length of the fence is 100 feet, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 60) = 100.

Combine like terms: 2x + 60 = 100.

Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20.

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

The amount of fence left over for Sam is 100 - 20 = 80 feet."
"To find the rate of growth per year, we can divide the total growth (8 inches) by the number of years (4). 

8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year

Now, we can multiply the rate of growth per year by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

The crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply the price of each type by the number sold.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold: 
Half of 300 bikes were Trekking bikes, so 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold: 
15% of 300 bikes were BMX bikes, so 0.15 * 300 = 45 BMX bikes.

Now, we can find the number of MTB bikes sold: 
300 - 150 (Trekking) - 45 (BMX) = 105 MTB bikes.

The prices of the bikes are $500 for MTB, $250 for BMX (half of $500), and $450 for Trekking.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500
Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250
Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500

Total earnings: $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To determine the number of bales left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made and the total number of bales picked up by the truck.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

To find the number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total minutes John spends in classes, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in classes per week. 

He attends 5 classes per week, each class is 40 minutes long, so the total minutes spent in classes per week is 5 * 40 = 200 minutes.

Since he also spends extra time on Saturday and Sunday, we need to calculate the total minutes spent on these days. There are 2 days, and he spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these days. 

First, we need to find the total minutes in a week. There are 60 minutes in an hour and 24 hours in a day, so there are 60 * 24 = 1440 minutes in a week. 

Now, we can find the total minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday: 1/16 * 1440 = 90 minutes.

Now, we can find the total minutes spent on learning per week: 200 + 90 = 290 minutes.

To convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 290 / 60 = 4.83 hours.

The final answer is 4.83."
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is 3 stories, which is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

After the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of its initial height, which is (2/3) * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of the height it reached after the first bounce, which is (2/3) * 48 = 32 feet.

Therefore, the ball goes 32 feet on its second bounce.

"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the heights of the first three children first.

The first child is 6 feet tall, which is equivalent to 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The final answer is 72."
"To find the total earnings, we need to divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10) to determine the number of bags sold. 

2000 ÷ 10 = 200 bags

Since each bag is sold at $5, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

200 bags * $5/bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples."
"To find the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards from the last known amount.

The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms of meat, so the velociraptors must have eaten half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. 

Let's denote the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate as x. Then, the velociraptors ate x/2 kilograms of meat. 

Since the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, we can set up the equation: x/2 = 270

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get x = 540 kilograms.

This is the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate. Since the T-Rex ate half of the initial amount, we can set up another equation: x = (1/2)y, where y is the initial amount of meat.

Substituting x = 540, we get 540 = (1/2)y

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get y = 1080 kilograms.

Therefore, there were 1080 kilograms of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate.

1080"
"To find the total area to be painted, we need to calculate the area of each wall and add them together. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, their combined area is 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of them, their combined area is 40 * 2 = 80 square feet.

The total area to be painted is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost will be 12 * 12 = $144."
"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the total number of sodas left and the number of shaken sodas.

Initially, Ellen had 12 sodas. She shook 3 of them, leaving 12 - 3 = 9 unshaken sodas. Then, she took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 9 - 1 = 8 unshaken sodas.

Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 8 - 2 = 6 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas.

Now, when Ellen's friend arrives, there are 6 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas left. The probability that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left, which is 2/8 = 0.25.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%.

The final answer is 25."
"To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them. 

The total distance between the two trains is 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we need to calculate the number of days he is available to help and then multiply it by the number of people he can help per hour.

There are 31 days in March. Billy takes 20% of the days off, which is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round down to 6 days off.

So, Billy is available to help for 31 - 6 = 25 days.

He can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, which means he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of days he is available to help (25) by the number of people he can help per day (6):

25 * 6 = 150

Therefore, Billy can help 150 people.

The final answer is 30."
"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: time = length / speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide: time = length / speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer to ride compared to the second biggest slide."
"To find the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total minutes and then convert it to hours.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 x 15-minute breaks per day. 

Total minutes per day = 30 + (2 x 15) = 30 + 30 = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

Total hours per day = 60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Since this is for 5 days, we multiply the total hours per day by 5.

Total hours for 5 days = 1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours

The total hours Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to is 5 hours."
"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we need to first determine how many miles Micah ran. 

Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we multiply 8 by 3.5 to find Micah's distance: 
8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now, we subtract the total miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles run by all three to find Ahito's distance: 
52 - 8 - 28 = 16 miles

Ahito ran 16 miles."
"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after the discounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan:
Original price: $20.00
Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Discounted price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the towels:
Original price: $30.00
Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
Discounted price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items purchased:
Cost of frying pan: $16.00
Cost of towels: $27.00
Total cost: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card and returned $15.00, so the new balance before the new purchases is:
$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Now, let's add the total cost of the new purchases to the new balance:
$70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (1/3)*(x/5) = x/15.

The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue. Since the total number of jellyfish is x, the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means 6 jellyfish are large and change color. This implies that the number of large jellyfish is 6 + x/15.

Since the number of large jellyfish is x/5, we can set up the equation:

x/5 = 6 + x/15

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 15 to eliminate the fraction:

3x = 90 + x

Subtracting x from both sides gives us:

2x = 90

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 45

Therefore, there are 45 jellyfish in the tank.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the age relationships between Caroline, Ben, and Chris. 

We know that Chris is 4 years old. Since Ben is two times older than Chris, we can calculate Ben's age as follows:

Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now, we know that Caroline is three times older than Ben. So, we can calculate Caroline's age as follows:

Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate her annual savings and then divide the total amount she needs to save by her annual savings.

First, let's calculate her annual savings: 
20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Since she plans to live on 40% of her current salary, her annual expenses will be:
40% of $100,000 = 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000 per year.

Now, let's calculate her annual savings after expenses:
$100,000 (annual salary) - $40,000 (annual expenses) = $60,000 per year.

Since she needs to save for 20 years, the total amount she needs to save is:
$60,000 (annual savings) * 20 (years) = $1,200,000.

Now, let's calculate how many years she needs to work to save this amount:
$1,200,000 / $20,000 (annual savings) = 60 years.

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save the required amount. Since she already has a 20-year retirement period, we need to subtract this from the total number of years:
60 years - 20 years = 40 years.

Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for her retirement."
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we divide the total length of the ribbon (100 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be cut into (4). This gives us the length of each of the initial cuts: 100 cm / 4 = 25 cm.

2. Then, we take the length of each initial cut (25 cm) and divide it by the number of equal parts it will be further divided into (5). This gives us the length of each final cut: 25 cm / 5 = 5 cm.

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

"To find the total population of the school, we can set up a proportion. Let's denote the total population as 'x'. 

Since 40% of the population is made up of boys, we can write the equation as:

40% of x = 240

To convert the percentage to a decimal, we divide by 100:
0.4x = 240

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.4:
x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

So, the total population of the school is 600.

To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total population:
Number of girls = Total population - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To find the total amount spent by your mom, we need to add the cost of the pots and the cost of the soil, then subtract the coupon value.

Cost of pots = $19
Cost of soil = $26
Total cost = $19 + $26 = $45
Coupon value = $7
Amount spent = Total cost - Coupon value = $45 - $7 = $38

The final answer is: $38"
"To find the average height of heels, we need to first find the total height of all the heels. 

Three women are wearing 4 inch heels, so the total height of these heels is 3 * 4 = 12 inches.

Three women are wearing 2 inch heels, so the total height of these heels is 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

To find the average height, we divide the total height by the total number of heels, which is 6. 

Average height = Total height / Total number of heels = 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days. To find out how many miles she needs to hike per day, we divide the total miles by the number of days:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is already hiking 125 miles per day, we subtract this from the required daily amount to find out how many more miles she needs to hike:

310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 185 more miles per day to complete her journey on time."
"To find the total amount the store will receive, we need to calculate the total revenue from each color of ball and then add them together.

Red balls: 3 * $9 = $27
Blue balls: 11 * $5 = $55
Green balls: 25 * $3 = $75

Total revenue = $27 + $55 + $75 = $157

The store will have received $157 after all the balls are sold."
"To find out how much each person gets, we need to calculate the amount each person wants.

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg.

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

Since Jacques is not mentioned in the question, we can assume that Jacques is the one left with the remaining amount. 

The total amount taken by Pierre and Paul is 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

So, Jacques will have 12 - 7 = 5 kg left."
"To find the temperature in the morning, we need to add the initial temperature and the increase in temperature.

Initial temperature = 2 degrees Celsius
Temperature after overnight drop = 2 - 8 = -6 degrees Celsius

The temperature in the morning was -3 degrees Celsius."
"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to subtract the money he spent from the money he had initially.

Raymond initially had $21.
He saved $11 from his allowance, so now he has $21 + $11 = $32.
He spent $5 on a comic book, so now he has $32 - $5 = $27.
He spent $19 on a puzzle, so now he has $27 - $19 = $8.

Raymond has $8 left.

"To find the cost of each book, we need to first determine the total amount Anna spent on the books. 

Anna had a budget of $16 and spent $4 initially, so she had $16 - $4 = $12 left. However, she also spent $2 on the books, so the total amount spent on the books is $12 - $2 = $10.

Since Anna bought 2 books that cost the same amount, we can divide the total amount spent on the books ($10) by 2 to find the cost of each book. 

$10 ÷ 2 = $5

The cost of each book is $5."
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we need to calculate 20% of the original number of students and add it to the original number.

20% of 50 is 0.20 * 50 = 10.

So, the increase in enrollment is 10 students.

The total number of students this year is 50 + 10 = 60.

"To find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we need to first determine the rate at which the light blinks per minute. 

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. 

Rate = Number of blinks / Time
Rate = 255 / 5
Rate = 51 blinks per minute

Now, we can use this rate to find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times.

Time = Number of blinks / Rate
Time = 459 / 51
Time = 9 minutes

The light will take 9 minutes to blink 459 times."
"To find the total number of male and female fish, we need to add the initial number of fish and the number of fish Tate bought.

Initial number of male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
Initial number of female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
Initial number of male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
Initial number of female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's find the total number of male and female fish:
Total number of male fish: 6 (guppies) + 5 (goldfish) = 11
Total number of female fish: 8 (guppies) + 8 (goldfish) = 16

To find the difference between the number of female and male fish, subtract the total number of male fish from the total number of female fish:
16 (female fish) - 11 (male fish) = 5

The difference between the number of female and male fish is 5."
"To find the total time they all took to do their chores, we need to calculate the time each person took to complete their tasks.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to complete her chore, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took over 4 hours longer than Amalia to complete her chore, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, we add up the time each person took to complete their tasks: 
4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours.

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"To find the total distance driven by John in a month, we need to calculate the round trip distance for one visit and then multiply it by 2, since he visits his parents twice a month.

The distance for one round trip is calculated as follows:
Distance = 2 * Speed * Time
Distance = 2 * 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 280 miles

Since John visits his parents twice a month, the total distance driven in a month is:
Total Distance = 2 * 280 miles
Total Distance = 560 miles

The final answer is: 560"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since she plans to walk 10 miles every day, we can multiply the number of miles she walks per day by the number of days:

10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles

Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, we can divide the total distance Sofie walks by 2 to find out how far Brian will walk:

70 miles / 2 = 35 miles

Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers. 

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys per hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys. 
The 2 workers who produce 4 toys per hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys. 
The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, the total number of toys needed is 200 + 20 = 220 toys.

Since 4 workers produced 200 toys, the 5th worker must have produced 220 - 200 = 20 toys.

Since the 5th worker worked for 10 hours, the number of toys the 5th worker produces per hour is 20 / 10 = 2 toys per hour.

The final answer is 2."
"To find the weight of Elijah's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we add the weights of both dogs: 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

To find the total weight of both Elijah and Kory's dogs, we add the weight of Elijah's dogs to Kory's dog: 45 + 60 = 105 pounds.

The final answer is: 105"
"To solve this problem, let's work backwards from the information given.

Kris gave 7 stickers to Rob, and Kris kept 9 stickers. So, Kris initially had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers.

Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris. Since Kris initially had 16 stickers, Luis must have had 16 + 7 = 23 stickers.

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Since Luis had 23 stickers, Seth must have had 23 * 2 = 46 stickers initially.

"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to calculate the total weight of the large bags and then multiply it by the number of M&M's per ounce.

Each large bag weighs 10 ounces, and there are 3 large bags. So, the total weight is 3 * 10 = 30 ounces.

Since each ounce contains 30 M&M's, the total number of M&M's is 30 * 30 = 900.

John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag. To find the number of small bags, we divide the total number of M&M's by 10.

Number of small bags = Total M&M's / 10 = 900 / 10 = 90.

The final answer is 90."
"To find the distance Alfie needs to fly to reach half of the way around the earth, we need to divide the circumference of the earth by 2.

Circumference of the earth = 40,000 kilometers
Half of the circumference = 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers

Since Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day, we can divide the distance he needs to fly by his daily distance to find the number of days it will take him to fly half of the way around the earth.

Number of days = Total distance / Daily distance
= 20,000 / 400
= 50

The answer is 50."
"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, we know the average car's speed is 120 miles per hour. 

Since the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, we can calculate its speed as follows:
2nd fastest car's speed = 5 * average car's speed
2nd fastest car's speed = 5 * 120
2nd fastest car's speed = 600 miles per hour

Now, we know the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we can calculate its speed as follows:
Faster car's speed = 1.25 * 2nd fastest car's speed
Faster car's speed = 1.25 * 600
Faster car's speed = 750 miles per hour

The faster car can go 750 miles per hour."
"To find Vince's current age, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as 'x'. Then, Liam's age two years ago was 2x.

Since Liam is 16 now, we can set up the equation: 16 = 2x + 2 (because Liam is 2 years older than he was 2 years ago).

Now, we solve for x: 
16 = 2x + 2
Subtract 2 from both sides: 
14 = 2x
Divide both sides by 2: 
7 = x

So, Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 to 7: 
7 + 2 = 9

Vince is 9 years old now.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A, the number of eggs painted by Madeline as M, the number of eggs painted by Camden as C, and the number of eggs painted by Sarah as S.

We know the following information:
1. A = M (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)
2. C + S = 30 (Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)
3. C = S + 12 (Camden painted 12 more than Sarah)

We can substitute the value of C from the third equation into the second equation:
S + (S + 12) = 30
Combine like terms:
2S + 12 = 30
Subtract 12 from both sides:
2S = 18
Divide both sides by 2:
S = 9

Now that we know S, we can find C:
C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Since A = M, we can find A:
A = M
A = 9

Now, we can find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold:
C - A = 21 - 9
C - A = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total weight of the crayons, we need to find the number of boxes Nik can fill with 200 crayons. 

Number of boxes = Total crayons / Crayons per box
= 200 / 8
= 25 boxes

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, the total weight of the crayons is:
Total weight of crayons = Number of boxes * Weight per box
= 25 * 8
= 200 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the weight of the crayons to pounds:
Total weight of crayons (in pounds) = Total weight of crayons / 16
= 200 / 16
= 12.5 pounds

The total weight of the boxes is the same as the weight of the crayons since they are filled with crayons:
Total weight of boxes = Total weight of crayons
= 12.5 pounds

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is the sum of their individual weights:
Total weight = Total weight of crayons + Total weight of boxes
= 12.5 + 12.5
= 25 pounds

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many logs John can make, we need to divide the total length of the tree by the length of each log. 

80 feet (total length) / 4 feet (log length) = 20 logs

Since John cuts 5 planks from each log, we multiply the number of logs by the number of planks per log.

20 logs * 5 planks/log = 100 planks

John sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

100 planks * $1.2/plank = $120

The final answer is: $120"
"To find the total amount of money Valerie and her brother have together, we need to first find their individual salaries. 

Since Valerie earns half of what her brother earns, let's denote her brother's salary as x. Then Valerie's salary is x/2. 

We know that Valerie's salary is $5000, so we can set up the equation: x/2 = 5000. 

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get x = 10000. 

So, Valerie's brother earns $10000 per month. 

Now, we can find their combined salary: Valerie's salary + brother's salary = 5000 + 10000 = 15000. 

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so her salary is 2 * 15000 = 30000. 

The total amount of money they all have together is Valerie's salary + brother's salary + mother's salary = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 38000."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the time spent on the sidewalk. 

Since Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk, and she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk, we can assume that the time spent on the sidewalk is twice the time spent on the beach. 

Let's denote the time spent on the beach as x minutes. Then, the time spent on the sidewalk is 2x minutes. 

We know that the total time spent on the walk is 40 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 40

Combine like terms:

3x = 40

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 40/3

x = 13.33 minutes

Since x is the time spent on the beach, the time spent on the sidewalk is 2x = 2(13.33) = 26.67 minutes.

Now, we can find the total time spent on the entire 3-mile walk by adding the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk:

Total time = x + 2x = 40 minutes

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we need to first calculate how much she has saved so far. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved is 4 * 8 = $32.

Since she wants to save a total of $60, we need to subtract the amount she has already saved from the target amount: 60 - 32 = $28.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take to save $28 at a rate of $4 per week. We can do this by dividing the remaining amount by the weekly savings: 28 / 4 = 7.

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add the number of blue birds in each tree.

Three trees had 7 blue birds each, so 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds.

Two trees had 4 blue birds each, so 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds.

One tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the total number of blue birds: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many marbles Bob originally had. 

We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 * 12 = 24. 

So, if he receives 24 marbles, he will have 60 marbles. To find out how many marbles he originally had, we subtract 24 from 60. 

60 - 24 = 36

Now, we know that Bob originally had 36 marbles. 

If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, we subtract 10 from 36. 

36 - 10 = 26

Therefore, Bob will have 26 marbles."
"To solve this problem, let's start by identifying the amount of water Donny has in each mug. We know he has two mugs, but the amount of water in each mug is not specified. However, we can use the information about the temperature to infer the amount of water in each mug.

Since Donny can drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug, the total amount of water he has is 5 ounces. 

Let's assume the unknown mug has x ounces of water. We know that the 33-degree mug has 4 ounces of water, and the other mug has x ounces of water. 

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

4 + x - 1 = 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 2

So, the unknown mug has 2 ounces of water.

Now, we need to find the temperature of the unknown mug. We know that the 33-degree mug has 4 ounces of water, and the unknown mug has 2 ounces of water. Since Donny can drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug, the total amount of water in the 33-degree mug after pouring is 4 - 4 = 0 ounces. 

The temperature of the 33-degree mug is now 0 degrees, and the temperature of the unknown mug is still x degrees. 

Since Donny can drink the water, the temperature of the unknown mug must be at least 40 degrees. 

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the unknown mug is 40 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.

Melkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day, so in 3 weeks (21 days), they will bring 20 * 21 = 420 cows.

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day, so in 3 weeks (21 days), they will bring 10 * 21 = 210 chickens.

Now, let's add the initial number of animals to the number of animals added:

Cows: 50 + 420 = 470
Chickens: 20 + 210 = 230

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 470 cows and 230 chickens.

Total number of animals = 470 + 230 = 700"
"To find the total cost of 4 packs of bagels, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs. 

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs will cost 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell gets a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $40.00. 

10% of $40.00 is 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since there are 9 bagels in each pack, and Russell ordered 4 packs, he will receive 9 * 4 = 36 bagels.

To find the cost of each bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

The final answer is $1.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we need to find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

Let's start by finding out how many scoops 3 less than 3 scoops is. 3 less than 3 scoops is 3 - 3 = 0 scoops. 

Now, we know that 3 less than 6 potatoes makes 0 scoops. To find out how many potatoes 0 scoops is, we need to divide 3 less than 6 potatoes by 0 scoops. However, division by zero is undefined. 

Let's rephrase the problem. We know that 3 less than 6 potatoes makes 0 scoops. We can say that 6 potatoes makes 3 scoops. 

Now, we know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. We can say that Gomer ate 23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

Since 6 potatoes makes 3 scoops, we can divide 18 scoops by 3 scoops to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate. 18 scoops / 3 scoops = 6 potatoes.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs is 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs is 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

The total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days is 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can convert 240 eggs to dozens by dividing by 12: 240 / 12 = 20.

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we need to first find the total number of red jellybeans. Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

Now, we know that the total number of jellybeans is 60, and we have already found the number of green and red jellybeans. To find the number of blue jellybeans, we subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans.

Number of blue jellybeans = Total number of jellybeans - (Number of green jellybeans + Number of red jellybeans)
= 60 - (17 + 34)
= 60 - 51
= 9

The number of blue jellybeans is 9."
"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the number of lemons he gets in a year and then multiply it by 10.

Since Tim grows 5 trees and each tree yields 6 lemons per year, the total number of lemons he gets in a year is:

5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons/year

To find the total number of lemons in a decade, we multiply the number of lemons per year by 10:

30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the number of women who have remained on the bus, we first need to determine the total number of women on the bus initially. 

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means that for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total number of parts in the ratio is 5 + 9 = 14. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can divide 84 by 14 to find the value of one part of the ratio. 

84 / 14 = 6

Now, we multiply the value of one part by the number of parts representing women in the ratio to find the initial number of women on the bus. 

9 parts * 6 = 54

Since 20 women alight from the bus, we subtract 20 from the initial number of women to find the number of women who have remained on the bus. 

54 - 20 = 34

The number of women who have remained on the bus is 34."
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we need to first find out how many bouquets he sold. 

Since each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 per day, we can divide $56 by $8 to find out how many bouquets he sold per day. 

$56 ÷ $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since he sold 7 bouquets per day for 3 days, we can multiply 7 by 3 to find out the total number of bouquets sold.

7 bouquets/day * 3 days = 21 bouquets

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we can multiply the total number of bouquets by 12 to find out the total number of sunflowers sold.

21 bouquets * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 252 sunflowers

The final answer is: 252"
"To determine the amount of money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys and the revenue he generates from selling 60% of his inventory.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks. Since Adam has $100 and buys rocks for $5 each, we can divide the total amount by the cost per rock to find the number of rocks he buys:

100 / 5 = 20 rocks

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling 60% of his inventory. 60% of 20 rocks is:

20 * 0.6 = 12 rocks

Since he sells each rock for $7, the total revenue is:

12 * 7 = $84

Now, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the loss:

$84 - $100 = -$16

Adam loses $16.

"To determine the number of days required to complete the project, we need to calculate the time it takes to complete each type of picture scene and then find the maximum time among them.

For large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
For medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
For small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

Since 9 days is the maximum time required, Lauren will take 9 days to complete the project."
"To find out how many eggs each child receives, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. 

First, we need to convert the number of eggs from dozens to individual eggs. Since one dozen is equal to 12 eggs, three dozen eggs would be 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, we divide the total number of eggs (36) by the number of children (4):

36 ÷ 4 = 9

So, each child receives 9 eggs."
"To find the total amount Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to calculate the daily cost and then multiply it by the number of days in May.

May has 31 days. 

The daily cost of food for each fish is $1. Since Jen has 3 fish, the total daily cost is 3 * $1 = $3.

The total cost for the month of May is $3 * 31 = $93.

The final answer is 93."
"To find the total number of roses Patricia has now, we need to subtract the number of roses she gave to her mother and then add the number of roses she bought.

Initial number of roses = 30
Number of roses given to her mother = 24
Number of roses bought = 15

Total number of roses now = Initial number of roses - Number of roses given to her mother + Number of roses bought
= 30 - 24 + 15
= 21

The final answer is 21."
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Total distance traveled = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles
Total time taken = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
= 250 miles / 5 hours
= 50 miles per hour

The average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the individual probabilities of each ticket winning.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as 0.20 in decimal form.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is 3 * 0.20 = 0.60.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the individual probabilities:

0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.12 * 100 = 12%

The probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many seashells each person initially collected. 

Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as 'x'. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, Carlos collected 2x seashells. 

We know that Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so Jim collected 2x + 5 seashells.

We also know that the total number of seashells collected is the sum of the seashells collected by each person. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + (2x + 5) = Total number of seashells

Combine like terms:

5x + 5 = Total number of seashells

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, the total number of seashells is 3 times the number each person gets. Let's denote the number each person gets as 'y'. Then, the total number of seashells is 3y.

Now, we can set up the equation:

5x + 5 = 3y

We also know that the total number of seashells is the sum of the seashells collected by each person. Therefore, we can write another equation:

x + 2x + (2x + 5) = 3y

Combine like terms:

5x + 5 = 3y

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x and y.

First, let's solve the equation 5x + 5 = 3y for y:

y = (5x + 5) / 3

Now, substitute this expression for y into the equation 5x + 5 = 3y:

5x + 5 = 3((5x + 5) / 3)

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

15x + 15 = 5x + 5

Subtract 5x from both sides:

10x + 15 = 5

Subtract 15 from both sides:

10x = -10

Divide both sides by 10:

x = -1

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of seashells each person initially collected. Carrey collected x seashells, so Carrey collected -1 seashell. However, this doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as you can't collect a negative number of seashells.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We made an incorrect assumption that the total number of seashells is 3y. Instead, we should find the total number of seashells first.

The total number of seashells is the sum of the seashells collected by each person:

x + 2x + (2x + 5) = 5x + 5

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, the total number of seashells is 3 times the number each person gets. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

5x + 5 = 3y

Now, we can solve for y:

y = (5x + 5) / 3

Substitute this expression for y into the equation 5x + 5 = 3y:

5x + 5 = 3((5x + 5) / 3)

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

15x + 15 = 5x + 5

Subtract 5x from both sides:

"To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday, and there are 2 weekend days. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 * 2 = 10.

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week. 

20 (weekdays) + 10 (weekend) = 30

The total number of carrots Mason eats in a week is 30."
"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. 

Since the second song is 60% longer than the first song, we can calculate its length by multiplying the length of the first song by 1.6 (100% + 60% = 160%, or 1.6 times the original length).

Length of the second song = 5 minutes * 1.6 = 8 minutes

Now, we can add the lengths of both songs to find the total time of the cassette.

Total time = Length of the first song + Length of the second song
Total time = 5 minutes + 8 minutes
Total time = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes."
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price of the devices.

The cost of 2 devices bought on Monday is 2 * $20 = $40.
The cost of 4 devices bought on Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80.
The total cost is $40 + $80 = $120.

The selling price of each device is twice the cost, so the selling price of each device is 2 * $20 = $40.
The total selling price of 6 devices is 6 * $40 = $240.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost, which is $240 - $120 = $120.

"To find the total daily energy demand of 2300 people, we need to calculate 20% of the daily energy demand per person and then multiply it by 2300.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can assume that 1 bottle covers 0.2 units of energy. 

The total daily energy demand of 2300 people is 2300 * 0.2 = 460 units.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many bottles are required to cover 460 units of energy.

Number of bottles required = Total energy demand / Energy per bottle
= 460 / 0.2
= 2300

Since Hortex already produces 4200 bottles per day, it can already cover the energy demand of 2300 people. Therefore, it doesn't need to produce more bottles to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

However, if we consider the question as asking how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce to cover 100% of the energy needs of 2300 people, the answer would be 0, as it already meets the requirement.

The final answer is 0."
"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the total number of babies wearing bows and the number of purple babies wearing bows.

Let's assume there are 8 babies in total (since it's an octuplet). 

Number of purple babies = 3/4 * 8 = 6
Number of blue babies = 1/4 * 8 = 2

Number of babies wearing bows = 1/3 * (number of blue babies + number of purple babies) 
= 1/3 * (2 + 6) 
= 1/3 * 8 
= 8/3 
Since we can't have a fraction of a baby, we'll round down to 2 (as we can't have a fraction of a baby wearing a bow).

Now, the number of purple babies wearing bows = 1/3 * 6 
= 2

The total number of babies wearing bows = 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4

The percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple = (number of purple babies wearing bows / total number of babies wearing bows) * 100
= (2 / 4) * 100
= 50%

"To find out how much money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from each sale.

First, he sold half of his 80 square meters of land for $50. Half of 80 is 40 square meters. 

So, he sold 40 square meters for $50. 

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. 1/4 of 80 is 20 square meters. 

So, he sold 20 square meters for $30.

Now, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left.

He sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter. So, he sold 20 square meters for 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, let's add up the money he received from each sale: $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. 

So, the last complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we can calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from. 

400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments

Since John collects garbage 3 times a week, the total number of collections per week is 1440 * 3 = 4320.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 4320 * 0.40 = $1728.

The final answer is: $1728"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree in each year.

Year 1: 50 fruits
Year 2: 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
Year 3: 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
Year 4: 7 * 150 = 1050 fruits
Year 5: 7 * 350 = 2450 fruits
Year 6: 7 * 1050 = 7350 fruits
Year 7: 7 * 2450 = 17150 fruits
Year 8: 10 * (7 * 2450) - 200 = 10 * 17150 - 200 = 171500 - 200 = 171300 fruits
Year 9: 0 fruits
Year 10: 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced by the tree in the first 8 years and the 10th year: 
50 + 150 + 350 + 1050 + 2450 + 7350 + 17150 + 171300 + 1000 = 235700

The total number of fruits that an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 235700."
"To find out how many dollars Jack has now, we need to calculate 1/5 of Sophia's $100 and add it to Jack's initial $100.

1/5 of $100 is $20. 

So, Jack had $100 initially and received $20 from Sophia. 

$100 + $20 = $120

Jack now has $120."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R. 

We are given the following information:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: R = 4B
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: B = Y - 7
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: R + B + Y = 37

We can substitute the expressions for R and B from the first two equations into the third equation:
4B + B + Y = 37
Combine like terms:
5B + Y = 37

Now, we can substitute B = Y - 7 into the equation:
5(Y - 7) + Y = 37
Expand the equation:
5Y - 35 + Y = 37
Combine like terms:
6Y - 35 = 37
Add 35 to both sides:
6Y = 72
Divide both sides by 6:
Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
B = Y - 7
B = 12 - 7
B = 5

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope:
R = 4B
R = 4 * 5
R = 20

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Rissa was given initially. 

Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. Let's say she gave x dollars to her sister. Then, the amount left with Rissa is 15 - x.

We know that the amount left with Rissa is 4/5 of her initial amount, so we can set up the equation:

15 - x = (4/5) * 15

Simplifying the equation, we get:

15 - x = 12

x = 3

So, Rissa gave $3 to her sister. Now, we know that Rissa was left with 15 - 3 = $12.

Since Rissa gave an equal amount of money to her sister, Ronnie also gave $3 to her sister.

Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Ronnie was given $5, and she gave $3 to her sister, so the amount left with Ronnie is:

5 - 3 = $2

The final answer is 2."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

Since half the mural is yellow, that means the other half is divided into three equal parts for red, white, and purple paint. 

Let's denote the amount of paint used for each color as 'x'. Since there are three colors (red, white, and purple) and they are equal, we can say that the total amount of paint used for these three colors is 3x.

We know that the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half of it is yellow, so the other half is 12 / 2 = 6 pints. This 6 pints is divided into three equal parts for red, white, and purple paint, so each of these parts is 6 / 3 = 2 pints.

Since 2 pints are for red paint, we can say that x = 2. 

Now, we can find the amount of red paint used by multiplying x by 3 (since there are three colors and each color has the same amount of paint). 

Red paint used = 3x = 3 * 2 = 6 pints.

The final answer is 6."
"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of each room and then add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together: 
240 (bedroom) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 2440 square feet.

The total area of the house is 2440 square feet."
"To find the total number of clouds Alice counted, we need to calculate the number of clouds for each day and add them together.

On Monday, she counted 3 clouds.

On Tuesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Monday, which is 2 * 3 = 6 clouds.

On Wednesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.

On Thursday, she counted double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.

On Friday, she counted double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add the number of clouds from each day: 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93 clouds.

The total number of clouds Alice counted in the sky at lunch across all five days is 93."
"To find the number of cycles, we first need to determine the cost of the new box. Since the price remains the same, and the new box has 20% more pods, we can calculate the cost per pod in the new box.

The original box has 100 pods and costs $12. So, the cost per pod is $12 / 100 = $0.12.

The new box has 20% more pods, which means it has 100 + (20% of 100) = 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

The cost per pod in the new box remains the same, $0.12. 

Now, we can calculate the number of cycles for $1 by dividing $1 by the cost per pod: $1 / $0.12 = 8.33.

Since you can't run a fraction of a cycle, we'll round down to 8 cycles.

The final answer is 8."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills initially.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he pays with 20 bills and is left with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling it means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

5. He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 * 5 = 300 5 dollar bills.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Since team B scored 2 goals in the first half, team B scored 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half. Therefore, team A scores 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals in the second half.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by each team in both halves. Team A scored 4 + 2 = 6 goals in total. Team B scored 2 + 8 = 10 goals in total.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 + 10 = 16.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much chalk the teacher has left after Monday. 

The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk and used 45% of it on Monday. 

First, we need to find out how much chalk he used on Monday. 
45% of 5 inches is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.

Since he can't write with less than 2 inches, he recycled the remaining chalk. So, he has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches left.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the teacher to use up the remaining chalk at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's divide the remaining chalk (2.75 inches) by 20% (or 0.2) to find the number of days:
2.75 / 0.2 = 13.75 days.

Since the teacher can't use a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after 14 days."
"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to calculate the number of students on varsity. 

One-third of the girls are on varsity, so the number of girls on varsity is 1/3 * 12 = 4.

One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so the number of boys on varsity is 1/4 * 12 = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 (boys) + 12 (girls) = 24.

The number of students not on varsity is 24 (total students) - 7 (students on varsity) = 17.

"To find out how many face masks Johnny bought, we need to first determine how many face masks Mike bought. 

Mike bought 5 face masks. 

Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. 

Thrice as many as Mike is 3 times 5, which is 15. 

2 more than 15 is 15 + 2, which is 17. 

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

"To find the total number of teeth fixed, we need to add the number of teeth drilled and capped. 

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more than that, so the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

Total number of teeth fixed = 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15

To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we divide the total number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth James has and multiply by 100.

Percentage of teeth fixed = (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is 50."
"To calculate the amount of milk that Mr. Marcellus returned, we need to find 2/5 of 4000 gallons.

2/5 of 4000 gallons = (2/5) * 4000 = (2 * 4000) / 5 = 8000 / 5 = 1600 gallons

Since Mr. Marcellus received a refund for the returned milk, we need to calculate the total refund amount.

The cost of milk per gallon is $3.5. 

Refund amount = Number of gallons returned * Cost per gallon
Refund amount = 1600 * $3.5
Refund amount = $5600

The final answer is: $5600"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Wendy's current age be W and Colin's current age be C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be represented as:

W = 5(C + 7)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

W = 5C + 35

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be represented as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Substituting the value of W from the first equation, we get:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

C = 20

So, Colin's current age is 20.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to first determine the total number of books he can buy with $27,000. 

Since Bob can buy 100 books for $500, we can find the cost per book by dividing $500 by 100 books:

$500 ÷ 100 books = $5 per book

Now, we can divide the total amount Bob has ($27,000) by the cost per book ($5) to find the total number of books he can buy:

$27,000 ÷ $5 = 5,400 books

Since Bob is distributing the books among 3 schools, we can divide the total number of books by 3:

5,400 books ÷ 3 schools = 1,800 books per school

The final answer is: 1,800"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps.

Initially, Newton had 2 apples. He picked up one and put it in his pocket, leaving him with 1 apple. Then, he threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. So, now he has 1 (the one he picked up) + 5 (the ones that fell out) = 6 apples.

Next, he picked up all but one of these apples and threw the remaining one back into the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. So, now he has 6 (the ones he picked up) + 6 (the ones that fell out) = 12 apples.

Finally, he picked up all of the remaining apples and went home. Therefore, he brought home 12 apples.

"To find the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to divide the total weight of coal (850 kg) by the weight of each bag (50 kg) to determine the number of bags. 

850 kg / 50 kg per bag = 17 bags

Now, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag ($18) to find the total cost.

17 bags * $18 per bag = $306

The total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To determine the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza is consumed.

For the cheese pizza, 6 friends eat 6 slices each, so the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed is 6 friends * 6 slices = 36 slices.

For the pepperoni pizza, 6 friends eat 4 slices each, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed is 6 friends * 4 slices = 24 slices.

Since each cheese pizza has 12 slices and each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, we can divide the total number of slices consumed by the number of slices per pizza to find the number of each type of pizza needed.

For cheese pizza: 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas
For pepperoni pizza: 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas

Since Kate needs 3 of each type of pizza, she needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas. Therefore, she needs to buy a total of 3 + 3 = 6 pizzas.

The total miles Sam ran this week is 19 miles."
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the rate at which Jay builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in 1 hour, so his rate of building snowballs is 20 snowballs per hour. 

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. To find the rate at which they melt, we need to convert 15 minutes to hours. 15 minutes is 0.25 hours. 

So, 2 snowballs melt every 0.25 hours. 

Now, we can find the rate at which snowballs melt per hour: 2 snowballs / 0.25 hours = 8 snowballs per hour.

Since Jay builds 20 snowballs per hour and 8 melt per hour, the net rate of building snowballs is 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs per hour.

To find the time it takes to build 60 snowballs, we can divide 60 by the net rate of building snowballs: 60 / 12 = 5 hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to build 60 snowballs.

"To find Jim's age, we need to work backwards from John's current age. 

Since John is twice as old as Jim, we can represent Jim's age as x. Then, John's age would be 2x.

We know John's current age is 28, so we can set up the equation: 2x = 28.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 2: x = 28 / 2 = 14.

Therefore, Jim is 14 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the total number of bandages at the end of the first day is x - 38 + 50 = x + 12.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the second day is (x + 12) - 28 = x - 16.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages, so they had x - 16 + 100 = x + 84 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the third day is (x + 84) - 25 = x + 59.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so we can set up the equation:

x + 59 = 78

Subtracting 59 from both sides gives us:

x = 19

Therefore, the nurses started with 19 bandages on the first day.

"To solve this problem, we can start by translating the given statement into an equation. Let's represent the number of coffee mugs as 'x'. The statement ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8. According to the problem, this expression is equal to 40. 

So, we can set up the equation: 4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 
4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we divide both sides by 4 to solve for x:
x = 32 / 4
x = 8

The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison's height, which is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Since the height of the first floor is 180 inches, the height of the second floor would be the remaining part of the total height, which is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor would be the height of the first floor minus the height of the second floor, which is 180 - 240 = -60 inches. However, this doesn't make sense in this context, as the height of the roof cannot be negative. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is actually the height of the first floor minus the height of the second floor, but we need to consider the height of the second floor as well. 

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is the height of the first floor minus the height of the second floor, which is 180 - 60 = 120 inches.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the number of shells team Gogetters found, we first need to calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas and team The finders.

Team Alphas found 40% of 700 shells, which is 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

The remaining shells after team Alphas found their share is 700 - 280 = 420 shells.

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells, which is 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Now, to find the number of shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the number of shells found by team Alphas and team The finders from the total number of shells.

Number of shells found by team Gogetters = 700 - 280 - 252 = 168.

The final answer is: 168"
"To find the total amount of exercise the dogs need per day, we can multiply the number of dogs by the average miles walked per dog. 

There are 4 dogs, and the average miles walked per dog is 3. 

Total miles per day = 4 dogs * 3 miles per dog = 12 miles

Since we know the total miles per day and the miles walked by the first three dogs, we can subtract those from the total to find the miles walked by the last dog.

Miles walked by the first three dogs = 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles

Miles walked by the last dog = Total miles per day - Miles walked by the first three dogs
= 12 miles - 8 miles
= 4 miles

The last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day."

"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first find the selling price of the magazines. 

The selling price is 11/8 times the cost price. 

Cost price = $72
Selling price = (11/8) * 72
Selling price = (11 * 9) = 99

Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

The final answer is 27."
"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total water removed at the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total water removed at the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total water removed at the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, we add the water removed at each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters."
"To find out how many balloons Jolene and her friends threw, we need to subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons. 

First, we calculate the total number of balloons: 10 packs * 30 balloons per pack = 300 balloons.

So, Jolene and her friends threw 288 balloons."
"To find the total amount of the second medicine, we need to multiply the amount of the first medicine by 3. 

14 mL * 3 = 42 mL

Since Saanvi needs to combine 14 mL of the first medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine, the total amount of the second medicine is 42 mL.

Now, to find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we need to multiply the total amount of the second medicine by 8.

42 mL * 8 = 336 mL

The final answer is: 336"
"To find the capacity of John's school, we need to calculate 1/8 of the capacity of Ali's class and then multiply it by 2 since John has two classes.

Capacity of Ali's class = 120 students
1/8 of Ali's class capacity = 120 / 8 = 15 students
Since John has two classes, the combined capacity of John's school = 15 * 2 = 30 students

The combined capacity of both schools = 120 (Ali's school) + 30 (John's school) = 150 students"
"To find the total amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to calculate the interest first. 

The interest is 2% of the initial $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount he will pay in the first 11 months is 11 * 25 = $275.

The total amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is the sum of the interest and the amount he has already paid, which is 275 + 6 = $281.

The final answer is: $281"
"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we need to first calculate the total number of diapers that need to be changed. Since Jordan has 2 children and each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, the total number of diapers that need to be changed is 2 * 5 = 10.

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, Jordan will change the other half. Therefore, Jordan will change 10 / 2 = 5 diapers per day.

"To find the volume of the jar, we need to multiply the length, width, and height. 

Volume = length * width * height 
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15 
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans have 80% efficiency in packing, we need to divide the volume by 0.8 to get the total number of jelly beans.

Total number of jelly beans = Volume / 0.8 
Total number of jelly beans = 540 / 0.8 
Total number of jelly beans = 675

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we need to multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3 to get the number of red jelly beans.

Number of red jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans * 0.3 
Number of red jelly beans = 675 * 0.3 
Number of red jelly beans = 202.5

Since the true number of red jelly beans is 900, we can find the difference between the true number and the estimated number.

Difference = True number of red jelly beans - Estimated number of red jelly beans 
Difference = 900 - 202.5 
Difference = 697.5

The estimated number of red jelly beans was 697.5, which is 697.5 - 900 = -202.5 less than the true number of red jelly beans."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people on the bus after each stop.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. 

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, so the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first stop, 3/4 of 40 is 30. So, 30 people entered at the second stop. The total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

Since the bus has a capacity of 200 people, the remaining spaces on the bus are 200 - 180 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits, we need to calculate the cost of her visits for the first 5 years and the next 3 years separately.

Initially, the cost of one visit was $2. After a 150% increase, the new cost of one visit is $2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5.

For the first 5 years, Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year, so the total cost for the first 5 years is 3 * $2 = $6 per year. For 5 years, the total cost is 5 * $6 = $30.

For the next 3 years, Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year, so the total cost for the next 3 years is 3 * $5 = $15 per year. For 3 years, the total cost is 3 * $15 = $45.

The total amount Pauline spent on all visits is $30 + $45 = $75.

"To determine the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed and the time each group will take.

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

Total students = 3 grades * 10 students per grade = 30 students
Number of groups = Total students / 8 students per group = 30 students / 8 = 3.75 groups

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we'll round down to 3 groups (as we can't have a partial group).

Each group will take 45 minutes to try the escape room. To find the total time, we multiply the number of groups by the time per group:

Total time = Number of groups * Time per group = 3 groups * 45 minutes per group = 135 minutes

Therefore, it will take 135 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

The total cost is $80 + $20 = $100.

John has to pay Ali $100."
"To find the length of the longer piece, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as 'x'. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

The total length of the board is 40 feet, so the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40. We can write the equation as:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x = 8), we can find the length of the longer piece:

Longer piece = 4x = 4(8) = 32

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs per pound, we can divide 80 by 16 to find the number of pounds needed.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds

Since Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound of ground beef, we can multiply the number of pounds needed by 2 to find the total amount of seasoning required.

5 pounds * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for the cookout.

"To find the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the number of windows by the width of each window. 

Number of windows = 5
Width of each window = 35 inches

Total width = Number of windows * Width of each window
Total width = 5 * 35
Total width = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2.

Total fabric needed = 2 * Total width
Total fabric needed = 2 * 175
Total fabric needed = 350 inches

"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute, so the total cost is:
16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.20 per minute, so the total cost is:
20 minutes * $0.20/minute = $4.00

The total cost of the 36-minute call is the sum of these two costs:
$4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of treats Carly made. Since each person gets two treats and there are five people in the class, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

We know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Let's represent the number of cupcakes as 'c'. Then, the number of brownies can be represented as 3c - 2.

Since the total number of treats is 10, we can set up the equation: c + (3c - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4c - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides: 4c = 12

Divide both sides by 4: c = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To find the total cost of the manicure and pedicure with nail art, we need to calculate the discount first. 

The basic manicure costs $35 and the basic pedicure costs $40. The total cost of both is $35 + $40 = $75. 

Since there's a 20% discount for getting both, we calculate the discount as 20% of $75, which is 0.20 * $75 = $15. 

The discounted price of the manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60. 

Now, we need to add the cost of nail art for each of the 10 fingers (5 fingers for each foot). The cost of nail art is $3 per nail, so the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30. 

The total cost of the manicure, pedicure, and nail art is $60 + $30 = $90."
"To find the total number of magazines Susan receives per year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them together.

The 3 magazines that send 12 issues each will send a total of 3 * 12 = 36 issues per year.

The 1 magazine that sends 6 issues per year will send 1 * 6 = 6 issues per year.

The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so it sends 4 * 6 = 24 issues per year.

Now, let's add the total number of issues from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

So, Susan receives 66 magazines per year.

66"
"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. Let's represent the number of paintings Shelley has as 'x'. Since Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, we can express this as:

Samantha's paintings = Shelley's paintings - 12
27 = x - 12

Now, we can solve for 'x' by adding 12 to both sides of the equation:

x = 27 + 12
x = 39

Now that we know Shelley has 39 paintings, we can use the information that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. Let's represent the number of paintings Kim has as 'y'. We can express this as:

Shelley's paintings = Kim's paintings + 8
39 = y + 8

Now, we can solve for 'y' by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

y = 39 - 8
y = 31

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the earnings from both the standard lessons and the lessons with veterans.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the standard lessons:
4 lessons * $80 per hour = $320

Since Charlie reduces his rate by 25% for veteran lessons, the reduced rate is:
$80 - (25% of $80) = $80 - $20 = $60 per hour

Now, let's calculate the earnings from the veteran lessons:
2 lessons * $60 per hour = $120

Now, we add the earnings from both types of lessons:
$320 + $120 = $440

The total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."

"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to first determine how many pomelos she had after giving some away. Since she is left with 1/4 of the original amount, we can set up the equation:

Original amount - Pomelos given away = 1/4 of the original amount

Let's represent the original amount as x. Then, the equation becomes:

x - Pomelos given away = x/4

We know that Eve had 20 pieces of pomelos originally, so we can substitute x = 20 into the equation:

20 - Pomelos given away = 20/4

To find the number of pomelos given away, we can simplify the equation:

20 - Pomelos given away = 5

Now, we can solve for Pomelos given away:

Pomelos given away = 20 - 5
Pomelos given away = 15

Then, he gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples. To find 25% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.25.

36 * 0.25 = 9 apples

Walter gave his sister 9 apples. Now, he has:

36 - 9 = 27 apples

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find the total amount of money he received, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 1200 minutes / 60
Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 20 hours

The custodian works 8 hours a day. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we can divide the total time spent cleaning by the total hours worked and multiply by 100:

Percentage of day spent cleaning classrooms = (Total time spent cleaning classrooms / Total hours worked) * 100
Percentage of day spent cleaning classrooms = (20 hours / 8 hours) * 100

"To determine the number of bookcases Elly needs, we need to calculate the total number of books each shelf can hold and then divide the total number of books by the total capacity of the shelves.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, and since each middle shelf can hold 10 books, the bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of the middle shelves: 2 middle shelves * 10 books/shelf = 20 books.

The total capacity of all the shelves is: 20 (bottom) + 20 (middle) + 15 (top) = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, she needs at least 2 bookcases to hold all of them, as 110 books / 55 books/bookcase = 2 bookcases.

"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first find the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's on sale for $3.00 off. 

$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can divide the total cost by the number of sticks to find the cost per stick.

$15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100.

$0.50 × 100 = 50 cents

"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly in both tests.

Since she needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, we can calculate the total number of questions as follows:

Total questions = (70% of 70) + (40)
Total questions = (0.7 * 70) + 40
Total questions = 49 + 40
Total questions = 89

Now, we can calculate the number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly in the first test:

Questions correct in the first test = 60% of 70
Questions correct in the first test = 0.6 * 70
Questions correct in the first test = 42

Since she needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, we can set up an equation:

Questions correct in the first test + Questions correct in the second test = Total questions
42 + Questions correct in the second test = 89

Now, we can solve for the number of questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test:

Questions correct in the second test = 89 - 42
Questions correct in the second test = 47

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 47 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

"To solve this problem, we can start by letting 'x' be the number of strawberry cubes Mary makes. Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, we can represent the number of blueberry cubes as 5x - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can set up the equation:

x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6x - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6x = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting x into the equation 5x - 4:

Number of blueberry cubes = 5(20) - 4

"To calculate the total number of points Ara has scored, we need to multiply the number of games she has played by the points she scores per game.

Number of games played per year = 40
Number of years = 4
Points scored per game = 21

Total points scored = Number of games played per year * Number of years * Points scored per game
Total points scored = 40 * 4 * 21
Total points scored = 3360

The total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is 3360."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Brendan started with 10 marbles.
2. He dropped half of them, so he lost 10 / 2 = 5 marbles.
3. He found 3 more marbles, so now he has 10 - 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.
4. He then found 1 more marble, but it was a bead, so he got rid of it. This doesn't change the number of marbles he has, so he still has 8 marbles.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know that for every 2 customers who come into the dealership, 1 car is sold. Since Jason needs to sell 15 cars, he needs 15 / 1 = 15 customers to come into the dealership.

Next, we know that for every 2 customers, 1 comes in. So, to get 15 customers, Jason needs 15 / 0.5 = 30 customers to come into the dealership.

Finally, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes in. So, to get 30 customers, Jason needs 30 / 0.04 = 750 telephone calls.

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of each type of light source and add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. There are 4 people and 2 flashlights per room, and there are 8 rooms. So, the total number of flashlights is 4 * 2 = 8.

Next, let's calculate the number of candles. There are 4 small candles for half the rooms (4 rooms) and 5 medium candles for the other half of the rooms (4 rooms). So, the total number of small candles is 4 * 4 = 16, and the total number of medium candles is 5 * 4 = 20.

Now, let's add the total number of flashlights and candles together: 8 (flashlights) + 16 (small candles) + 20 (medium candles) = 44.

The total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using when the lights go out is 44."
"To find out how many chips each person gets, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of family members. 

First, we need to find the total number of chips. Since Mitchell bought two bags of chips with 55 chips each, the total number of chips is 2 * 55 = 110.

Now, we divide the total number of chips by the number of family members: 110 / 5 = 22.

So, each person gets 22 chips."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes to complete each side of the Rubik's cube and then add them up.

The first side takes 5 minutes.
The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each.
The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time it takes to complete each side:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

Therefore, it takes John 30 minutes to complete the Rubik's cube.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of robots and footballs. 

Since there are half as many robots as helmets, and there are 20 helmets, we can calculate the number of robots as follows:

Number of robots = Number of helmets / 2
= 20 / 2
= 10

Since there are half as many helmets as footballs, we can calculate the number of footballs as follows:

Number of footballs = Number of helmets * 2
= 20 * 2
= 40

Now, we can find the total number of items by adding the number of robots, helmets, and footballs:

Total number of items = Number of robots + Number of helmets + Number of footballs
= 10 + 20 + 40
= 70

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, we need to first calculate the total number of minutes he spends on calls per day. 

Since he spends 6 hours per day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the hours to minutes by multiplying 6 hours by 60 minutes per hour, which equals 360 minutes per day.

Now, we can divide the total minutes per day by the time it takes to deal with a single call (15 minutes) to find the number of calls per day. 

360 minutes per day / 15 minutes per call = 24 calls per day

Since Tim works 5 days a week, we can multiply the number of calls per day by 5 to find the total number of calls per week.

24 calls per day * 5 days per week = 120 calls per week

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the difference in drying time, we need to calculate the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings and subtract the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

Time for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings = 7 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 42 minutes
Time for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings = 12 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 72 minutes

The difference in drying time = 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes

The new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry on 6 paintings compared to the old varnish.

"To find the total amount of water needed, we need to calculate the water required for each group of plants and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the water needed for the 4 plants that require half a cup of water:
4 plants * 0.5 cups/plant = 2 cups

Next, let's calculate the water needed for the 8 plants that require 1 cup of water:
8 plants * 1 cup/plant = 8 cups

Now, let's calculate the water needed for the remaining plants. Since Crista has 20 plants in total, and 4 + 8 = 12 plants have been accounted for, the remaining number of plants is:
20 - 12 = 8 plants

Since these 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water, we can calculate the total water needed as follows:
8 plants * 0.25 cups/plant = 2 cups

Now, let's add up the water needed for all the plants:
2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups

Therefore, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it takes to hop on land and the time it takes to swim in the water.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance is 200 yards. Therefore, the distance on land is 200 / 2 = 100 yards.

The time it takes to hop on land is the distance divided by the speed, which is 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes.

The time it takes to swim in the water is also 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes.

Since these two parts are independent, we add the times together to get the total time: 5 minutes (hopping) + 10 minutes (swimming) = 15 minutes.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total cost, we need to divide the number of popsicle sticks needed by the number of sticks per box and then multiply by the cost per box.

"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in a month. Since there are approximately 30 days in June, we can multiply the number of doughnuts he sells per day by 30.

10 dozen doughnuts per day is equivalent to 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.

In June, Derrick sells 120 doughnuts per day for 30 days, so the total number of doughnuts sold is 120 * 30 = 3600 doughnuts.

Since each doughnut is sold for $2, the total amount of money Derrick makes in June is 3600 * 2 = $7200.

Alicia spends $47.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate John's new speaking speed after training and then determine how long it would take him to speak 10 pages.

First, we need to find John's new speaking speed. Since his speed is 2.5 times faster than his original speed, we multiply his original speed by 2.5.

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Now, we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages. Since each page has 450 words, we multiply the number of pages by the number of words per page.

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words/page = 4500 words

Now, we can calculate the time it would take John to speak 4500 words at his new speed.

Time = Total words / New speed
Time = 4500 words / 375 WPM
Time = 12 hours

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the number of people on each day.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the number of people is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the total number of people was twice the number on the second day, so the number of people is 2 * 70 = 140.

Now, we know the number of people on the first three days. To find the total number of people for the rest of the week, we need to multiply the average number of people (60) by the number of days (5) and add it to the total number of people on the first three days.

Total number of people on the first three days = 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

Total number of people for the rest of the week = 60 * 5 = 300.

Total number of people for the rest of the week = 300.

Total number of people Conor saw that week = 260 + 300 = 560.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of kernels that popped during the entire process.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped. 
In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount popped, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increased to four times the initial rate, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.
In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate decreased to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 80 / 2 = 40 kernels popped.

Now, let's calculate the total number of kernels that popped during the entire process:
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels.

A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat. 
A quarter of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Now, we need to add the kernels that popped from the residual heat to the total number of kernels that popped during the entire process:
200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

"To determine the total number of lemons needed, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for 5 gallons of lemonade. 

Since Tim needs 1 cup of lemon juice per gallon, he will need 5 cups of lemon juice for 5 gallons. 

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 5 cups as follows:

5 cups / 1 cup per 6 lemons = 5 * 6 = 30 lemons

For the extra gallon that is twice as tart, we need to calculate the amount of lemon juice required. Since it's twice as tart, it will require half the amount of juice as the other gallons. 

So, for the extra gallon, we need 1/2 cup of lemon juice. 

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 1/2 cup as follows:

1/2 cup / 1 cup per 6 lemons = 1/2 * 6 = 3 lemons

Now, we add the lemons needed for the 5 gallons and the extra gallon:

30 lemons + 3 lemons = 33 lemons

2 Bulldogs * 3 kg/day = 6 kg/day
Total daily consumption = 15 kg/day + 6 kg/day = 21 kg/day

Now, let's calculate the weekly consumption:
21 kg/day * 7 days = 147 kg

The Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs, we need to calculate the total number of legs of all the animals and then divide by 2.

The 2-legged animals have 2 legs each, so the total number of legs from these animals is 10 * 2 = 20.

The 4-legged animals have 4 legs each, so the total number of legs from these animals is 15 * 4 = 60.

Now, we add the total number of legs from both types of animals: 20 + 60 = 80.

To find the total number of pairs of animal legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2: 80 / 2 = 40.

Therefore, there are 40 pairs of animal legs on the farm.

"To find the number of red blocks, we need to first determine the total number of blue and yellow blocks. 

Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, and there are 4 blue blocks, the number of yellow blocks is 2 * 4 = 8.

The total number of blue and yellow blocks is 4 + 8 = 12.

Since the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, the number of red blocks can be found by subtracting the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks: 32 - 12 = 20.

Therefore, there are 20 red blocks."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Elvis traveled. 

Since Elvis traveled west for 5 hours at 18mph, the distance he covered is 5 * 18 = 90 miles.

Then, he turned around and traveled east for 8 hours at the same speed of 18mph. The distance he covered in this part is also 8 * 18 = 144 miles.

Since he traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the net distance from his house. 

The net distance is the difference between the two distances, which is 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

So, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house.

"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial value = $9000
Depreciation = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after Year 1 = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Year 2: 
Initial value = $6300
Depreciation = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after Year 2 = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Year 3: 
Initial value = $4410
Depreciation = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after Year 3 = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The boat is worth $3528 after three years."
"To find the number of pink candies, we need to first find the number of orange and yellow candies. 

We know that the bag has 54 red candies. Since there are twice as many orange candies as red candies, the number of orange candies is 2 * 54 = 108.

We also know that there are half as many yellow candies as red candies, so the number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, we can find the total number of candies that are not pink by adding the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

Since the total number of candies in the bag is 232, the number of pink candies is 232 - 189 = 43.

"To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we need to first determine how many marbles Dallas had initially. 

Dallas had 21 marbles after dropping 4, so we can calculate the initial number of marbles Dallas had by adding the marbles dropped to the marbles he had left: 21 + 4 = 25.

Since Mazie gave the marbles to both Dallas and Darla, the total number of marbles given away is 52. We know Dallas initially had 25 marbles, so we can subtract this from the total number of marbles given away to find out how many marbles Darla received: 52 - 25 = 27.

Therefore, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla.

Weight of the car = 1200 pounds
Weight of the luggage = 250 pounds
Weight of the children = 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we can calculate it as follows:

Force = 1% of 1600 pounds = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

Therefore, John needs to push the car with a force of 16 pounds."

"To find the average of their ages, we need to first find their ages. 

Since Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart, Emma's age can be calculated by adding 16 to Mia's age. 

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now, we can find the average of their ages by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2

"To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga practice, we need to calculate the time spent each week and then multiply it by the number of weeks.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes in the evening, so she spends 30 minutes per day on meditation. 

She practices 1 hour (60 minutes) of yoga 5 days a week. 

Total time spent on meditation per week: 30 minutes * 2 (morning and evening) = 60 minutes
Total time spent on yoga per week: 60 minutes * 5 days = 300 minutes

Total time spent on meditation and yoga per week: 60 minutes + 300 minutes = 360 minutes

Since there are 4 weeks, the total time spent on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks is: 360 minutes * 4 = 1440 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the number of pens Timothy has, since we know George has 18 pens. 

Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, we can multiply the number of pens George has by 3 to find Timothy's pens. 

18 * 3 = 54

Now that we know Timothy has 54 pens, we can find out how many pens Sarah has. Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we divide Timothy's pens by 2.

54 / 2 = 27

Therefore, Sarah has 27 pens.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

We know Albert is 36"" tall. Since Anne is twice the size of Albert, we can calculate Anne's height as 2 * 36"" = 72"".

We also know Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, so we can calculate Jackie's height as 72"" - 2"" = 70"".

Since Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, we can calculate her height before the summer as 70"" - 3"" = 67"".

The final answer is 67""."
"To find the total amount of money the company will receive for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks and then multiply it by the selling price per bar.

Since the company produces 5000 bars in one day, in two weeks (14 days), it will produce 5000 * 14 = 70,000 bars.

The selling price per bar is $2, so the total amount of money the company will receive is 70,000 * 2 = $140,000.

140,000"
"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a 50% discount on the original price of $8. 

The original price of 2 T-shirts is 2 * $8 = $16.
The discount on 2 T-shirts is 50% of $16, which is 0.5 * $16 = $8.
The price of 2 T-shirts after the discount is $16 - $8 = $8.

Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, the cost of 1 T-shirt after the discount is $8 / 2 = $4.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and there is a 40% discount.

The discount on the shoes is 40% of $40, which is 0.4 * $40 = $16.
The price of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, we can find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store by adding the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes.

The total amount of money Jake spends is $4 (T-shirts) + $24 (shoes) = $28.

The final answer is: $28"
"To find out how much money Ryan has, we need to calculate his earnings from completing chores and subtract the cost of the ice cream cones.

Ryan earns $6 per week for 3 weeks, so his total earnings are:
6 * 3 = 18

He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each, so the total cost of the ice cream cones is:
1.25 * 4 = 5

Now, subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from his total earnings:
18 - 5 = 13

Ryan has $13 left. To find out how many movie tickets he can buy, we need to divide the remaining amount by the cost of each ticket:
13 / 6.50 = 2

Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets."

"To find the total cost of making one jar of the mixture, we need to calculate the cost of the ingredients. 

Cost of passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6 per pound = $12
Cost of jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8 per pound = $12
Cost of honey: 2 pounds * $10 per pound = $20
Total cost of one jar: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Now, to find the profit per jar, we subtract the cost from the selling price: $50 - $44 = $6 per jar.

To find the total profit from selling 10 jars, we multiply the profit per jar by 10: $6 * 10 = $60.

The final answer is $60."
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add them together.

The value of a quarter is $0.25, so 32 quarters is 32 * $0.25 = $8.
The value of a dime is $0.10, so 95 dimes is 95 * $0.10 = $9.50.
The value of a nickel is $0.05, so 120 nickels is 120 * $0.05 = $6.
The value of a penny is $0.01, so 750 pennies is 750 * $0.01 = $7.50.

Now, let's add the values together: $8 + $9.50 + $6 + $7.50 = $31.

The total dollar amount in the jar is $31."

Janet has $13 left."
"To find out how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to calculate the number of days he is open and the total number of cars he services in that time.

Josh is open 6 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday). In 2 weeks, he is open 2 * 6 = 12 days.

Since Josh services 3 cars a day, in 12 days, he services 12 * 3 = 36 cars.

He gets paid $4 per car, so his total earnings in 2 weeks would be 36 * 4 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find out how many cookies Randy has now, we need to calculate the number of cookies he had initially, subtract the cookies he ate, and then add the cookies he baked.

Initially, Randy had 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. 

He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. So, he ate 3 cookies in total. 
9 - 3 = 6 oatmeal cookies
4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies

Then, he ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. 
6 - 2 = 4 oatmeal cookies

He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. 
4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies

Now, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. 
4 + 4 = 8 oatmeal cookies
3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies
2 + 4 = 6 sugar cookies

So, Randy now has 4 oatmeal cookies, 7 chocolate chip cookies, and 6 sugar cookies.

Total number of cookies = 4 + 7 + 6 = 17 cookies.

"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the earnings from each half of the collection and add them together.

Half of the collection is 12 / 2 = 6 toys.

For the first half (6 toys at $5 each), the total earnings would be 6 * 5 = $30.

For the second half (6 toys at $7 each), the total earnings would be 6 * 7 = $42.

The total earnings would be the sum of these two amounts: $30 + $42 = $72.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then determine how many holes Nate fills per week.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is:
6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

Since Nate fills 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night, the net change in the number of holes per day is:
9 holes/day (filled) - 6 holes/day (dug) = 3 holes/day

To find the number of days it takes Nate to fill the holes, we can divide the total number of holes by the net change in the number of holes per day:
84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert the number of days to weeks:
28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

Therefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we need to first calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School. 

Since Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

Average enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * Average enrollment at Norman High School
= (3/4) * 4000
= 3000

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools:

Difference in average enrollment = Average enrollment at Norman High School - Average enrollment at Butler High School
= 4000 - 3000
= 1000

The average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 greater than the average enrollment at Butler High School."
"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Number of chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies made - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)
= 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

The Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, so Igor gathered half as many, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

We also know that Igor gathered 2 more Petri dishes than requested, so the number of Petri dishes he gathered is 14 + 2 = 16.

The total number of items Igor gathered is 8 test tubes + 16 beakers + 16 Petri dishes = 40.

However, the total number of items he placed on the lab bench is 29. This means that the number of beakers he gathered is 40 - 29 = 11.

Since Igor gathered 16 beakers, the number of beakers he lost is 16 - 11 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the total number of screws needed, we need to multiply the number of tables by the number of legs per table and then by the number of screws per leg.

Number of tables: 4
Number of legs per table: 4
Number of screws per leg: 2

Total screws needed = 4 * 4 * 2 = 32

James has 40 screws. To find the number of screws left over, we subtract the total screws needed from the total screws he has:

40 - 32 = 8

James will have 8 screws left over."
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket. 

Since there are 10 eggs in the first basket and twice as many eggs in the second basket, we can calculate the number of eggs in the second basket as 2 * 10 = 20 eggs.

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets: 10 + 20 = 30 eggs.

The total number of eggs in both baskets is 30."
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount each girl raised and then add them together.

Alexandra raised $430.
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.
Sarah raised $300.

Now, let's add the amounts raised by each girl:
$430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2080.

The total amount of money raised is $2080."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the speeds and distances of Aaron and Vanessa. 

Let's denote Aaron's speed as 'a' miles per minute and Vanessa's speed as '2a' miles per minute, since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa. 

We know that Vanessa ran 4 miles, and we need to find out how long it took her to run that distance. 

Since Vanessa's speed is 2a miles per minute, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. 

So, the time it took Vanessa to run 4 miles is 4 / (2a) = 2 / a minutes.

We are given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron's speed is 'a' miles per minute, we can set up an equation to find 'a'. 

Let's denote the distance Aaron ran as 'd'. Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, the distance Vanessa ran is 2d. We know that Vanessa ran 4 miles, so 2d = 4, which means d = 2 miles. 

Now, we can set up the equation for Aaron's time: 2d / a = 16. Substituting d = 2, we get 2 * 2 / a = 16, which simplifies to 4 / a = 16. 

Solving for 'a', we get a = 4 / 16 = 1/4 miles per minute. 

Now that we know 'a', we can find the time it took Vanessa to run 4 miles: 2 / (1/4) = 2 * 4 = 8 minutes.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we first need to calculate the total length of line required for the existing dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3.

200 feet of dock * 3 feet of line per foot of dock = 600 feet of line required

Since the caretaker already has 6 feet of line, we subtract this from the total required.

600 feet of line required - 6 feet of line available = 594 feet of line needed

The caretaker needs 594 feet of line in total."
"To calculate the total revenue per night, we need to calculate the total cost of meals and add the cost of the wine. 

The cost of meals per night is 6 * $5 = $30. 
Adding the cost of the wine, the total cost per night is $30 + $5 = $35.

Since they are open 2 days a week, the total revenue per week is 2 * $35 = $70.

The final answer is: $70"
"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to first find the total cost of all the watermelons and then calculate the selling price.

The total cost of 50 watermelons is $80. 

Since the profit is 25%, we can calculate the selling price as follows:

Selling price = Cost price + Profit
= $80 + (25% of $80)
= $80 + (0.25 * $80)
= $80 + $20
= $100

Now, to find the selling price of each watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:

Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons
= $100 / 50
= $2

The fruit vendor sold each watermelon for $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that Dora will turn 12 in 3 years. So, her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

We also know that John had a son when he was 19, and that son is James. So, John's current age is 18 + 18 = 36 years.

Now, we need to find the age of John's youngest son, who was born when John was 32. Since John is 36 now, his youngest son is 36 - 32 = 4 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 4 + 3 = 7 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time each person spends peeling oranges and then find the difference in the number of oranges they peel.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, and Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes. 

In 1 hour (60 minutes), Ana will peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges, and Jane will peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator first. 

The original price of the radiator is $400. Since Mark gets it for 80% off, we need to find 20% of the original price (100% - 80% = 20%). 

20% of $400 is 0.20 * $400 = $80. 

So, the cost of the radiator is $400 - $80 = $320.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the labor. The mechanic charges $50 per hour, and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator. 

The cost of labor is $50 * 3 = $150.

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of labor to get the total cost. 

Total cost = $320 + $150 = $470.

The final answer is: $470"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of legs each type of animal has. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. 

Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'b'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write an equation: c + b = 20.

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can write another equation: 2c + 4b = 70.

We can simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 2: c + 2b = 35.

Now we have two equations:

1) c + b = 20
2) c + 2b = 35

Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get: b = 15.

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens by substituting b into the first equation: c + 15 = 20, so c = 5.

Therefore, Farmer Brown has 5 chickens.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, we need to find the total number of slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is 7 * 8 = 56.

Now, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people, which is 4 (Henry and his 3 friends). 

56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person.

The final answer is 14."
