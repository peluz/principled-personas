"To determine how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs she lays and then subtract the eggs she consumes and bakes.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left. She bakes 4 muffins, which means she uses 4 eggs for baking. 

Now, subtract the eggs used for baking from the remaining eggs: 13 - 4 = 9 eggs.

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. 

To find out how much she makes, multiply the number of eggs sold by the price per egg: 9 * 2 = 18 dollars.

The final answer is 18."
"To determine the total number of bolts required, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fibers separately and then add them together.

The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 
It takes half that much white fiber, which is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt.

So, the total number of bolts required is 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

"To calculate Josh's profit, we need to first determine the original value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. After the repairs, the value increased by 150%. 

To find the new value, we multiply the original value by 2.5 (1 + 1.5, or 150% increase). 

New value = $80,000 * 2.5 = $200,000

Now, we subtract the cost of the repairs from the new value to find the profit.

Profit = New value - Cost of repairs
Profit = $200,000 - $50,000
Profit = $150,000

The final answer is: $150,000"
"To determine the total number of meters James runs per week, we need to calculate the total distance he covers in a week.

Since James runs 3 sprints per session, and he does this 3 times a week, the total number of sprints per week is 3 sessions * 3 sprints/session = 9 sprints.

Each sprint is 60 meters, so the total distance covered per week is 9 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 540 meters.

Therefore, James runs a total of 540 meters per week."
"To determine the total amount of feed Wendi needs for her chickens, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she has already given them. 

In the morning, she gave 15 cups of feed to 20 chickens, which is 15 / 20 = 0.75 cups per chicken. 
In the afternoon, she gave 25 cups of feed to 20 chickens, which is 25 / 20 = 1.25 cups per chicken.

The total amount of feed per chicken is 0.75 + 1.25 = 2 cups.

Since Wendi has 20 chickens, the total amount of feed she needs for the final meal is 20 * 2 = 40 cups.

The final answer is: 40"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to consider the cost of the first glass and the cost of the subsequent glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
For every second glass, the cost is 60% of the original price, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can calculate the cost as follows:

- The cost of the first glass: $5
- The cost of the remaining 15 glasses: 15 * $3 = $45
- Total cost: $5 + $45 = $50

The final answer is: $50"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many sheep Charleston has. Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Next, we know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we can add up the number of sheep each city has: 20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260.

The total number of sheep is 260."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where Carla downloads 60% of the file, and the second part where she downloads the remaining 40% of the file.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download 60% of the file. Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, we can calculate the time as follows:

Time = Total size / Download rate
Time = 0.6 * 200 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time = 0.6 * 100 minutes
Time = 60 minutes

Now, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning, which takes 20 minutes. So, the total time elapsed so far is:

Total time elapsed = 60 minutes + 20 minutes
Total time elapsed = 80 minutes

Now, Carla starts the download again from the beginning. Since she has already downloaded 60% of the file, she still needs to download 40% of the file. We can calculate the time it takes to download the remaining 40% of the file as follows:

Time = Total size / Download rate
Time = 0.4 * 200 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time = 0.4 * 100 minutes
Time = 40 minutes

Now, we add the time it takes to download the remaining 40% of the file to the total time elapsed:

Total time = Total time elapsed + Time to download remaining 40%
Total time = 80 minutes + 40 minutes
Total time = 120 minutes

Therefore, it takes Carla 120 minutes to download the 200 GB file.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into segments and calculate the distance covered in each segment.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

Then, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move.

Next, he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.

Finally, he drives for 2 hours at 80 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 2 = 160 miles.

To find the total distance covered, we add the distances covered in each segment: 180 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles.

Since John started 180 miles away from home and drove a total of 355 miles, he is 355 - 180 = 175 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for this week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings would be 40 * $10 = $400.

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so her overtime rate is $10 * 1.2 = $12. Her earnings for the overtime hours would be 5 * $12 = $60.

Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for this week would be $400 + $60 = $460.

$460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and then add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which equals 54. So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

Now, we add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

The total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts: 3 dozen donuts * $68 per dozen = 3 * 68 = $204.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes: 2 dozen cupcakes * $80 per dozen = 2 * 80 = $160.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen cheesecakes * $55 per dozen = 6 * 55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year. 

The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, which can be sold for $1.5 each, resulting in a revenue of 7 * $1.5 = $10.5. However, it also costs $3 to water and feed the tree each year. 

The net profit each year is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5. 

To find out how many years it will take for the tree to start earning money, we need to subtract the initial cost from the net profit. 

$7.5 (net profit) - $90 (initial cost) = -$82.5. Since the net profit is negative, the tree is not yet earning money. 

However, we can continue to calculate the net profit for subsequent years until it becomes positive. 

Year 1: $7.5 (net profit) 
Year 2: $7.5 + $7.5 = $15 (net profit) 
Year 3: $15 + $7.5 = $22.5 (net profit) 
Year 4: $22.5 + $7.5 = $30 (net profit) 
Year 5: $30 + $7.5 = $37.5 (net profit) 
Year 6: $37.5 + $7.5 = $45 (net profit) 
Year 7: $45 + $7.5 = $52.5 (net profit) 
Year 8: $52.5 + $7.5 = $60 (net profit) 
Year 9: $60 + $7.5 = $67.5 (net profit) 
Year 10: $67.5 + $7.5 = $75 (net profit) 
Year 11: $75 + $7.5 = $82.5 (net profit) 
Year 12: $82.5 + $7.5 = $90 (net profit) 

It will take 12 years for the tree to start earning money on itself.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as 'x'. 

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners. 

Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, the total number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green and red houses is x/3 + 2.

Now, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. This means she sold (x - (x/3 + 2))/2 vacuum cleaners at the orange house.

We know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:

x - (x/3 + 2) - (x - (x/3 + 2))/2 = 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - (x/3 + 2) - (2x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - (x/3 + 2) - x/3 + 1 = 5

Combine like terms again:

x - 2x/3 - 1 = 5

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3x - 2x - 3 = 15

Combine like terms:

x - 3 = 15

Add 3 to both sides:

x = 18

Therefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students
Number of students remaining = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the merchant's best choice, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option.

For the jewelry option:
Initial cost: $5,000
Market increase: 2.5%
Potential value: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,250

For the electronic gadgets option:
Initial cost: $8,000
Market increase: 1.2%
Potential value: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,160

Since the potential value of the jewelry ($5,250) is less than the potential value of the electronic gadgets ($8,160), the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit.

Profit = Potential value - Initial cost
For jewelry: $5,250 - $5,000 = $250
For electronic gadgets: $8,160 - $8,000 = $160

The merchant would make a profit of $160 by choosing the electronic gadgets."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered by each train on the first day and the distance covered by each train on the second day.

On the first day, both trains travel westward for 80 miles. Since they are traveling in the same direction, we can consider them as moving in the same line. Therefore, the distance covered by each train on the first day is 80 miles.

On the second day, both trains travel northward for 150 miles. Since they are traveling in the same direction, we can again consider them as moving in the same line. Therefore, the distance covered by each train on the second day is 150 miles.

To find the total distance covered by each train in the two days, we add the distances covered on the first and second days. 

Total distance covered by each train = Distance covered on the first day + Distance covered on the second day
= 80 miles + 150 miles
= 230 miles

"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to first calculate her weekly income from both jobs and then multiply it by the number of weeks she works in a year.

Weekly income from teaching: 35 hours/week * $20/hour = $700/week
Weekly income from coaching: 15 hours/week * $30/hour = $450/week
Total weekly income: $700/week + $450/week = $1150/week

Since Jill works 50 weeks a year, her annual salary would be: $1150/week * 50 weeks/year = $57,500/year

57,500"
"To determine the number of dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs she consumes in that time frame. 

Since Claire makes 3 eggs every morning, we multiply the number of eggs she makes per day by the number of days in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so there are 28 days in 4 weeks.

Total eggs per day = 3 eggs
Total days in 4 weeks = 28 days

Total eggs in 4 weeks = Total eggs per day * Total days in 4 weeks
Total eggs in 4 weeks = 3 eggs/day * 28 days
Total eggs in 4 weeks = 84 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12.

Total dozens of eggs = Total eggs in 4 weeks / 12
Total dozens of eggs = 84 eggs / 12
Total dozens of eggs = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the required speed for the remaining distance, we first need to calculate the total distance Marissa has already covered. She walked 4 miles and then 2 miles, so the total distance covered is 4 + 2 = 6 miles.

Since Marissa wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we can calculate the total time she needs to spend walking the entire trail. 

Time = Total Distance / Average Speed
Time = 12 miles / 4 mph
Time = 3 hours

We know Marissa has already spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles. To find the remaining time, we subtract the time spent from the total time needed.

Remaining Time = Total Time - Time Spent
Remaining Time = 3 hours - 2 hours
Remaining Time = 1 hour

Since Marissa needs to cover the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour, we can calculate the required speed.

Required Speed = Total Distance / Remaining Time
Required Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Required Speed = 6 mph

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink separately, then add them together and subtract the spilled amount.

The orange drink is two-thirds water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water in both drinks: 20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = 49/3 liters.

However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract that from the total amount of water: 49/3 - 1 = 46/3 liters.

To convert this to a decimal, we can divide the numerator by the denominator: 46/3 ≈ 15.33 liters.

The final answer is 15.33."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of Raymond when his son was born. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is now 31, we can calculate Raymond's current age as follows:

Raymond's current age = Samantha's current age - 6
Raymond's current age = 31 - 6
Raymond's current age = 25

Now, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract Raymond's age at the time of his son's birth from his current age:

Years since son's birth = Raymond's current age - Raymond's age at son's birth
Years since son's birth = 25 - 23
Years since son's birth = 2

The final answer is: 2"
"To determine the total number of DVDs sold, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to each group of customers and then add them together.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought 3 DVDs in total.

The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs in total.

The last 3 customers bought 0 DVDs each, so they bought 0 DVDs in total.

Now, let's add the DVDs sold to each group: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7.

Therefore, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"To determine the total length of the candle that will be melted, we need to calculate the total number of hours the candle burns. 

From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is a total of 4 hours.

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting:

4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the original price as 'x'. Since Kyle got a 25% discount, the amount he paid is 75% of the original price. 

We can express this as: 0.75x = 19.50

To find the original price 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75.

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she has already ordered. 

The cost of the chicken meal is $12. 
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15. 
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6. 

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33. 

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the remaining amount she spent on pizza is $50 - $33 = $17. 

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, the number of boxes she ordered is $17 / $8.50 = 2.

"To find the total amount Mishka spent, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing and then add them together.

The cost of 3 pairs of shorts is 3 * $16.50 = $49.50.
The cost of 3 pairs of pants is 3 * $22.50 = $67.50.
The cost of 3 pairs of shoes is 3 * $42 = $126.

Now, let's add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items."
"To determine the total cost of ice cream for Cynthia, we need to calculate the number of cartons she buys and the total cost.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will need 60 servings in 60 days. 

60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

The cost of each carton is $4.00, so the total cost will be:

4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to determine the total distance he traveled before his second stop and then subtract the distance he traveled after his second stop.

Henry traveled 20 miles before his first stop. 

The remaining distance after his first stop is 60 - 20 = 40 miles.

His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, so the distance he traveled after his second stop is 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

Now, we can find the distance between his first and second stops by subtracting the distance traveled after the second stop from the remaining distance after the first stop: 40 - 45 is incorrect, as it would be negative. 

The correct calculation is: 20 (distance before the first stop) + 15 (distance before the second stop) = 35 miles.

The correct answer is 35 miles."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the cost of the boots as B. We know that the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. Since one pair of heels costs $33, the other pair must cost $33 + $5 = $38. 

We also know that the other pair of heels costs twice as much as the first pair, so its cost is 2 * $33 = $66. 

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total cost of the boots and the heels: B + $33 + $38 = B + $71. 

However, this equation is not helpful, as it doesn't involve the cost of the boots. Let's re-examine the problem. We know that the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. So, we can set up the equation: $33 + $66 = B - $5. 

Simplifying the equation, we get $99 = B - $5. Adding $5 to both sides, we get $104 = B.

The final answer is: 104"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios and algebra. Let's assume Darrell's current age is 7x and Allen's current age is 11x, where x is a constant.

We know that their total age is 162, so we can set up the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms:

18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age:

Allen's current age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is: 109"
"To find the average guess, we need to first calculate the number of jelly beans each person guessed.

The first person guessed 80 jelly beans.

The second person guessed 20 more than half of the first person's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than that is 40 + 20 = 60.

The third person guessed 25% more than the first person's guess. 25% of 80 is 0.25 * 80 = 20. So, 25% more than that is 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, we have the number of jelly beans guessed by each person: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add these numbers together and divide by 3: (80 + 60 + 100) / 3 = 240 / 3 = 80.

The average guess is 80."
"To determine the total hours John spends taking care of dogs per week, we need to calculate the daily hours and then multiply it by 7.

Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. Since John has 10 dogs, the total daily hours spent on dog care would be:

10 dogs * 0.5 hours/dog = 5 hours/day

To find the total hours spent per week, we multiply the daily hours by 7:

5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

The final answer is: 35"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic equation. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'. 

We know that the total number of coins is 110, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins (x = 40), we can find the number of gold coins by adding 30:

Number of gold coins = x + 30
= 40 + 30
= 70

The final answer is 70."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, we know that Raymond has 40 jewels.

Since Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, we need to find half of Raymond's jewels first. Half of 40 is 20.

Aaron has 5 more jewels than 20, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

"To find the total points scored, we need to calculate the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the points scored in the second 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4 points, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which equals 1 point. 

So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in both periods: 4 (first 20 minutes) + 5 (second 20 minutes) = 9 points.

Therefore, Mike scored a total of 9 points.

"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of yogurts he eats in 30 days and then multiply it by the cost per yogurt.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The sale is 4 yogurts for $5.00, so the cost per yogurt is $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.

Now, we multiply the total number of yogurts by the cost per yogurt: 60 yogurts * $1.25 = $75.00.

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total amount of money John has after selling his Lego sets. 

He sells 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he gets is 13 * 15 = $195.

After buying 8 video games for $20 each, he spends 8 * 20 = $160. 

So, the amount of money he has left is 195 - 160 = $35.

However, the question asks how many Lego sets he still has, not how much money he has. Since he started with 13 Lego sets and spent all of them, he now has 0 Lego sets left.

"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week and then divide it by the total time he spends running.

First, let's calculate the total distance he runs in a week:

- He runs 3 hours on the first day, which is 3 miles (since we don't know his speed, we'll use the given distance).
- He runs half as much on the other two days, which is 1.5 hours per day. Since he runs 3 miles on the first day, he runs 1.5 miles on each of the other two days. 
  - Total distance for the other two days = 1.5 * 2 = 3 miles
- Total distance in a week = 3 miles (first day) + 3 miles (other two days) = 6 miles

Now, let's calculate his speed:

Speed = Total distance / Total time
Speed = 6 miles / 6.5 hours (3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours)
Speed = 6 / 6.5
Speed ≈ 0.9231 miles per hour

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine Dana's running and walking speeds. 

Given that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and skipping is half as fast as running, we can calculate her running speed as follows:

Running speed = 2 * skipping speed
Running speed = 2 * 3 miles per hour
Running speed = 6 miles per hour

Since Dana can walk at a rate that is one-fourth of her running speed, we can calculate her walking speed as follows:

Walking speed = Running speed / 4
Walking speed = 6 miles per hour / 4
Walking speed = 1.5 miles per hour

Now, we know Dana's running and walking speeds. We also know that she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. 

To find the total distance she can travel in six hours, we need to calculate the distance she covers while running and walking separately and then add them together.

Time spent running = 1/3 * 6 hours = 2 hours
Distance covered while running = Running speed * Time spent running
Distance covered while running = 6 miles per hour * 2 hours
Distance covered while running = 12 miles

Time spent walking = 2/3 * 6 hours = 4 hours
Distance covered while walking = Walking speed * Time spent walking
Distance covered while walking = 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours
Distance covered while walking = 6 miles

Total distance covered = Distance covered while running + Distance covered while walking
Total distance covered = 12 miles + 6 miles
Total distance covered = 18 miles

The final answer is: 18"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the age of each iPhone based on the given information. 

We know that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, we can calculate Ben's iPhone age as follows: 
Ben's iPhone age = 2 * Suzy's iPhone age
Ben's iPhone age = 2 * 1
Ben's iPhone age = 2 years

Now, we know that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's. Therefore, we can calculate Brandon's iPhone age as follows:
Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * Ben's iPhone age
Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * 2
Brandon's iPhone age = 8 years

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone. Since she can throw the javelin three times farther when holding the gemstone, we can multiply the original distance by 3. 

The original distance is 400 feet, so when holding the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 * 3 = 1200 feet.

Since the dragon's flames can reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the gemstone.

The final answer is: 200"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of pie pieces available initially. Since Grandma Jones baked 5 pies and cut each pie into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is 5 x 8 = 40.

We know that 14 pieces of pie remained after the guests took some. To find out how many pieces were taken, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces: 40 - 14 = 26.

Therefore, the guests took 26 pieces of pie.

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to calculate the total calories available for consumption. Since you have already consumed 1800 calories, you have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left.

Since each serving has 250 calories, we can calculate the number of servings you can have with 200 calories as follows: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since each serving is 5 grams, we can multiply the number of servings by the weight per serving to find the total weight: 0.8 servings * 5 grams/serving = 4 grams.

Therefore, you can eat 4 grams of chips.

"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each:

Total Revenue = Number of candles * Price per candle
Total Revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total Revenue = $40.00

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of making 20 candles. Since it takes 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks to make one candle, and Charlie makes 20 candles, he needs:

20 candles * 1 pound of beeswax and wicks per candle
= 20 pounds of beeswax and wicks

The cost of 20 pounds of beeswax and wicks is $10.00. 

Total Cost = Cost of beeswax and wicks
Total Cost = $10.00

Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

Net Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Net Profit = $40.00 - $10.00
Net Profit = $30.00

The final answer is: $30."
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply that by the average time it takes to write an article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is 5 * (2/5) = 2 more articles. So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles written:
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours

The final answer is: 104"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice used. We know that she used 220 Post-it notes at work and had 23 remaining. 

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as 'x'. Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. 

The total number of Post-it notes she used is the sum of the Post-it notes she initially had and the ones she purchased. Since she had 23 remaining, the total number of Post-it notes she used is 80 + x - 23 = 57 + x.

We also know that she used 220 Post-it notes at work. Therefore, we can set up the equation 57 + x = 220.

Solving for x, we get x = 220 - 57 = 163.

The final answer is: 163"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of blue ties John bought. We know he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. 

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is 2 times the number of blue ties.
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
= 10

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the blue tie. 
Cost of each red tie = $40 + (50% of $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches and then divide it by the length of each piece.

There are 12 inches in 1 foot. So, 4 feet is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches):

48 ÷ 6 = 8

Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire.

"To find the total number of unoccupied units, we first need to determine the total number of units in the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor contains 8 units, the total number of units is 15 * 8 = 120.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is 3/4 * 120 = 90.

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units: 120 - 90 = 30.

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs produced per week:
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens:
1764 eggs / 12 = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, we can multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen to find the total weekly earnings:
147 dozen eggs * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

The final answer is: $294"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance Tom traveled from 1 to 4 PM and then use that distance to find the time it takes to travel back.

Since Tom is sailing from 1 to 4 PM, he is traveling for 3 hours at a rate of 10 miles per hour. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, to find the time it takes to travel back, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the weight of the comic books Uriah is removing. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

30 * 1/4 = 30/4 = 7.5 pounds

Since Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total, the weight of the toys he needs to remove is:

15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Now, we know that each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we can divide the weight of the toys by the weight of each toy:

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

"To determine which day had the higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The total revenue for Thursday is:
6 * $60 (truck tires) + 4 * $40 (car tires) = $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and 0 truck tires. The total revenue for Friday is:
12 * $40 (car tires) = $480

Since $520 is greater than $480, the mechanic earned more revenue on Thursday.

The difference in revenue between the two days is:
$520 - $480 = $40

The final answer is 40."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, we can calculate Patchy's kittens as follows:

Patchy's kittens = 3 * Trixie's kittens
Patchy's kittens = 3 * 12
Patchy's kittens = 36

Now, we need to add the number of kittens the Doubtfire sisters adopted (7) to the number of kittens Patchy and Trixie had. 

Total kittens = 7 (adopted) + 36 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens)
Total kittens = 55

The Doubtfire family now has 55 kittens."
"To determine the number of bags Jean can fill, we need to first find out how many lollipops are left after Jean eats 2. 

Jean started with 30 lollipops and ate 2, so the number of lollipops left is 30 - 2 = 28.

Since Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag, we can divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to find out how many bags can be filled.

28 ÷ 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

"To determine how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the total cost of a movie outing and then divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of a single outing.

The total cost of a movie outing is the sum of the ticket price and the popcorn price, which is $7 + $7 = $14.

Now, we can divide the total amount of money Peter has ($42) by the cost of a single outing ($14) to find out how many times he can go to the movies:

$42 ÷ $14 = 3

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week.

"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit and then divide the result by the weight of a single box.

Weight limit of the bridge = 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck = 3755 pounds
Weight of a single box = 15 pounds

First, subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit:
5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Now, divide the result by the weight of a single box:
1245 / 15 = 83

So, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to calculate the number of raspberries in the clusters and add it to the number of individual raspberries.

There are 6 clusters of 20 fruit each, so the total number of raspberries in the clusters is 6 * 20 = 120.

Adding the 67 individual raspberries, the total number of raspberries is 120 + 67 = 187.

The total number of raspberries is 187."
"To find the number of good oranges, we first need to determine the total number of oranges that are not good. 

We know that 20% of the oranges are unripe, so the number of unripe oranges is 20% of 25, which is 0.2 * 25 = 5.

We also know that 2 oranges are sour. 

The total number of oranges that are not good is the sum of the unripe and sour oranges, which is 5 + 2 = 7.

Since there are 25 oranges in total, the number of good oranges is 25 - 7 = 18.

"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to break down her pension into two parts: the initial 20 years and the remaining 10 years.

For the first 20 years, her annual pension is $50,000. 

For the remaining 10 years, her pension increases by 5% each year. We can calculate the value of the pension for each year as follows:

Year 21: $50,000 * 1.05 = $52,500
Year 22: $52,500 * 1.05 = $55,125
Year 23: $55,125 * 1.05 = $57,863.75
Year 24: $57,863.75 * 1.05 = $60,750.9375
Year 25: $60,750.9375 * 1.05 = $64,000.984375
Year 26: $64,000.984375 * 1.05 = $67,340.328125
Year 27: $67,340.328125 * 1.05 = $70,857.3453125
Year 28: $70,857.3453125 * 1.05 = $74,493.858359375
Year 29: $74,493.858359375 * 1.05 = $78,261.19140625
Year 30: $78,261.19140625 * 1.05 = $82,144.52099609375

The total pension for the remaining 10 years is the sum of these values: 
$52,500 + $55,125 + $57,863.75 + $60,750.9375 + $64,000.984375 + $67,340.328125 + $70,857.3453125 + $74,493.858359375 + $78,261.19140625 + $82,144.52099609375 = $609,737.5

Now, we add the pension for the first 20 years to the pension for the remaining 10 years:
$50,000 + $609,737.5 = $659,737.5

So, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be $659,737.5."
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break down the payment into two parts: the initial amount for the first half of the year and the reduced amount for the second half of the year.

The initial amount for the first half of the year is $140. Since there are 6 months in the first half of the year, the total amount paid for the first half is 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charges 10% less money. 10% of $140 is $14, so the reduced amount for the second half of the year is $140 - $14 = $126. Since there are 6 months in the second half of the year, the total amount paid for the second half is 6 * $126 = $756.

To find the total amount paid for the year, we add the amounts paid for the first and second halves: $840 + $756 = $1596.

The final answer is: 1596"
"To determine how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate the total capacity of her tank and the amount of gas she has already used.

The owner's manual states that her tank holds 12 gallons of gas. Since she has already used 4 gallons to fill it up, we need to subtract the amount used from the total capacity to find out how much gas is left in the tank.

12 gallons (total capacity) - 4 gallons (used) = 8 gallons (remaining gas)

Now, we need to find out how many miles she can drive on 8 gallons of gas. We know that she has already traveled 100 miles since the last fill-up. To find the miles per gallon, we can divide the distance traveled by the amount of gas used:

100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know the miles per gallon, we can multiply it by the remaining gas in the tank to find out how far Sophia can drive on a single tank:

8 gallons * 25 miles per gallon = 200 miles

Therefore, Sophia can drive 200 miles on a single tank of gas.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time spent on TV and reading per week, and then multiply it by 4.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV per session. Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent on TV per week is 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

He reads for half as long as he watches TV, so he reads for 2 / 2 = 1 hour per session. Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent on reading per week is 1 * 3 = 3 hours.

The total time spent on TV and reading per week is 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

In 4 weeks, Jim spends 9 * 4 = 36 hours on TV and reading.

"To determine the total number of people sent by the schools, we need to calculate the number of teams and coaches.

Each school has sent 2 teams (1 boys' and 1 girls'), and each team has 5 players. So, the total number of players is 2 teams per school * 5 players per team = 10 players per school.

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of players is 10 players per school * 4 schools = 40 players.

Each school has also sent 1 coach for each team, so the total number of coaches is 2 coaches per school * 4 schools = 8 coaches.

Therefore, the total number of people sent by the schools is 40 players + 8 coaches = 48 people.

"To solve this problem, we need to first identify the number of rubies and emeralds. 

We know there are 175 diamonds. Since there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, the number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140.

The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so the number of emeralds is 2 * 140 = 280.

Now, we can find the total number of gems by adding the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds: 175 + 140 + 280 = 595.

Since she had a total of $100 at the end of 8 weeks, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Initial amount + $40 = $100

To find the initial amount, we subtract $40 from both sides of the equation:

Initial amount = $100 - $40
Initial amount = $60

Therefore, Bailey started with $60.

"To calculate the total amount Shiela will pay each month, we need to first calculate the total cost of the cell phones and then add the interest.

The total cost of the cell phones is 5 units * $150 per unit = $750.

Since the interest is 2% per unit, the interest for each unit is 2% of $150, which is $3.

The total interest for 5 units is 5 * $3 = $15.

The total amount Shiela will pay each month is the cost of the cell phones plus the interest, which is $750 + $15 = $765.

However, this amount is for 3 months. To find the monthly payment, we divide the total amount by 3: $765 / 3 = $255.

So, Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months.

Level 1 (top): 16
Level 2: 16 / 2 = 8
Level 3: 8 / 2 = 4
Level 4 (bottom): 4 / 2 = 2

Now, we add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30

"To determine the number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food she will use in the first year. 

In the first 180 days, she feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, in 180 days, she will use 180 cups of dog food. 

After the first 180 days, she feeds the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day. Since there are 365 days in a year, she will use 2 cups/day * 185 days (365 - 180) = 370 cups of dog food.

The total amount of dog food used in the first year is 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags used in the first year is 550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags.

30% of $100 = 0.3 * $100 = $30

Since the groomer is offering a discount, we subtract the discount from the original cost.

$100 - $30 = $70

The grooming cost after the discount is $70."
"To find out how many liters of water were left, we first need to determine the total amount of water the two girls initially had. Since each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters, we can calculate it as follows:

1/6 * 24 = 4 liters per girl

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they had is:
2 * 4 = 8 liters

After the boy got 6 liters, we subtract this amount from the total:
24 - 8 - 6 = 10 liters

So, there are 10 liters of water left.

"To find out how many stickers Charlie has left, we need to calculate the total number of stickers he initially had, then subtract the stickers he gave away and used.

Charlie initially had 10 stickers. He bought 21 stickers and got 23 for his birthday, so the total number of stickers he had is 10 + 21 + 23 = 54.

He gave 9 stickers to his sister, so we subtract 9 from 54: 54 - 9 = 45.

Then, he used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so we subtract 28 from 45: 45 - 28 = 17.

Therefore, Charlie has 17 stickers left.

"To find Alex's weight, we need to calculate 4 times what Grace weighs and then subtract 2 pounds. 

First, we multiply Grace's weight by 4: 
4 * 125 = 500

Then, we subtract 2 pounds from the result: 
500 - 2 = 498

Now, we add Alex's weight to Grace's weight to find their combined weight: 
125 + 498 = 623

The final answer is: 623"
"To find the total number of thorns, we need to multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush, and then multiply that result by the number of thorns per rose.

Number of rose bushes: 3
Number of roses per bush: 25
Number of thorns per rose: 8

Total number of roses: 3 * 25 = 75
Total number of thorns: 75 * 8 = 600

Therefore, there are 600 thorns in total."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic equation. Let's denote the number of games lost as 'x'. Since the team won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won can be represented as 'x + 8'. 

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so the sum of the games won and lost is equal to 22. This can be written as:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by adding 8:

x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

Therefore, the football team won 15 games.

"To determine the total number of quilt blocks Gene has, we need to calculate the number of blocks from each year of his vacations. Since he goes on four vacations a year and has been vacationing since he was 23 years old, we can calculate the number of blocks as follows:

1. Gene started vacationing at 23 years old, so the first year he went on vacation was at 23 years old.
2. He has been vacationing for 11 years (34 - 23 = 11).
3. Since he goes on four vacations a year, the number of blocks from each year of his vacations is equal to the number of years he has been vacationing.
4. Therefore, the number of blocks from each year of his vacations is 11 (11 years * 4 vacations per year).
5. To find the total number of blocks, we multiply the number of blocks from each year by the number of years: 11 * 11 = 121.

Gene has 121 quilt blocks in total."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of times the alarm rang. 

The first time it rang for 4 times. 
The second time it rang for 3 times as long as the first time, so it rang for 4 * 3 = 12 times. 
The third time it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang for 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, we add the number of times the alarm rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The alarm rang a total of 22 times.

"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to apply the 10% annual increase for each year. 

Initially, Sylvie's salary is $600. 

Year 1: $600 + 10% of $600 = $600 + $60 = $660
Year 2: $660 + 10% of $660 = $660 + $66 = $726
Year 3: $726 + 10% of $726 = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60
Year 4: $798.60 + 10% of $798.60 = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46
Year 5: $878.46 + 10% of $878.46 = $878.46 + $87.84 = $966.30

Since Sylvie has already clocked 5 years of service, we need to calculate her salary for the next three years. 

Year 6: $966.30 + 10% of $966.30 = $966.30 + $96.63 = $1062.93
Year 7: $1062.93 + 10% of $1062.93 = $1062.93 + $106.29 = $1169.22
Year 8: $1169.22 + 10% of $1169.22 = $1169.22 + $116.92 = $1286.14

The final answer is: $1286.14"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as 'x'. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, we can represent the number of copies Marilyn sold as 10x.

The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Marilyn and Harald, which is given as 88,000. So, we can write the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 8,000

Therefore, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

"To determine the number of gift bags needed, we first need to calculate the number of guests who will attend. Since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, we can calculate the number of guests who will attend as follows:

Number of guests who will attend = Total number of invited guests - Number of guests who don't show up
= 16 - (1/4 * 16)
= 16 - 4
= 12

Now, we can calculate the total number of gift bags needed:

Number of gift bags needed = Number of guests who will attend
= 12

Since each gift bag costs $2, the total cost can be calculated as follows:

Total cost = Number of gift bags needed * Cost per gift bag
= 12 * 2
= 24

"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed, we first need to calculate the amount each child will eat. Since a child eats half as much as an adult, and an adult eats 10 lbs, a child will eat 10 / 2 = 5 lbs.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults and children separately. There are 20 adults, and each adult eats 10 lbs, so the total amount for adults is 20 * 10 = 200 lbs.

There are 5 children, and each child eats 5 lbs, so the total amount for children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amount for adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

225"
"To solve this problem, we need to start with the information about Cindy's pets. Since Cindy has four pets, and Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

Now, we can add up the number of pets each person has to find the total number of pets: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

The total number of pets the three have is 28."
"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey. This means Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

We also know that Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Lastly, Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine Lee's original speed. Since Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, we can denote Gerald's original time as 'x'. Therefore, Lee's original time would be 'x - 2'. 

We know that Lee's new time is 38 seconds, and his speed has improved by 10%. This means his new time is 90% of his original time. We can express this as 0.9(x - 2) = 38.

Now, we can solve for 'x'. 

0.9(x - 2) = 38
0.9x - 1.8 = 38
0.9x = 39.8
x = 44.44

Now that we know Gerald's original time, we can calculate his new time. Gerald's new time is 90% of his original time, which is 0.9 * 44.44 = 40.00 seconds.

The final answer is 40."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, we can multiply the number of dogs by 2 to find the number of cats.

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
= 2 * 60
= 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we need to add the number of dogs and cats, and then subtract 12.

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 60 + 120
= 180

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
= 180 - 12
= 168

Now, we can find the total number of pets in the neighborhood by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
= 60 + 120 + 168
= 348

"To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls in the class. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 must be girls. 

Total students = 200
Number of boys = 2/5 * 200 = 80
Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

Now, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Number of girls not in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

"To find out how many hours James slept, we need to calculate 2/3 of the hours Harry slept. 

Since Harry slept 9 hours, we multiply 9 by 2/3. 

9 * 2/3 = 18/3 = 6 hours

So, James slept 6 hours. 

To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept.

9 - 6 = 3 hours

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to first determine how many ounces of tomatoes she used. Since she lost half of the volume when cooking, the 32 ounces of sauce she made came from 64 ounces of tomatoes (32 * 2 = 64). 

Since each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes, we can divide the total ounces of tomatoes (64) by 16 to find out how many cans she used, and then multiply that by 3 to find out how many tomatoes she used. 

64 / 16 = 4 cans
4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam. We know that 5 cars took an exit, so they did not drive through the traffic jam. 

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as 'x'. 

We also know that 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. 

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. 

Since there were originally 30 cars on the motorway, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25. 

We can set up the equation: x + 20 = 25. 

Solving for x, we get x = 5.

Therefore, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

"To determine the number of potted plants Mary will remain with, we need to calculate the total number of plants she currently has and subtract the number of plants she will give away.

Mary currently has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so the total number of plants she has is 2 * 40 = 80.

She will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family, which is 1 * 40 = 40 plants.

To find the number of plants Mary will remain with, we subtract the number of plants she will give away from the total number of plants she currently has: 80 - 40 = 40.

Therefore, Mary will remain with 40 potted plants.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and then sum them up.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times. 

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed 1/4 times more than the first friend, which means the second friend pressed 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of doorbell rings: 60 (fourth friend) + 70 (third friend) + 25 (second friend) + 20 (first friend) = 175.

The doorbell made 175 rings in total."
"To determine the total number of pages Solo needs to read, we need to add up the pages from all the textbooks. 

4 pages (Science) + 20 pages (Social Studies) + 7 pages (History) + 8 pages (Geography) = 39 pages

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Frankie spent watching TV on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. 

On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1 hour each night, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours. 

The total time spent watching TV on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours. 

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday can be calculated by subtracting the time spent on the other days from the total time. 

7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes. 

1.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 90 minutes.

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we can divide 90 minutes by 30 minutes to find the number of episodes. 

90 / 30 = 3.

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 episodes of a 30-minute show on Wednesday."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x.

Since Henry wants to make twice as many cookies this year, he will bake 2x cookies this year.

However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked this year is 2x + 15.

He drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has left is 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10.

We are given that the number of cookies he has left is 110, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 50

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we need to first calculate the total number of roll-ups each of them had.

Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 roll-ups wide * 24 rolls up long = 48 roll-ups
Marcell's roll-ups: 3 roll-ups wide * 14 rolls up long = 42 roll-ups

Since they both ate their entire amount, we can add the total number of roll-ups they had: 48 + 42 = 90 roll-ups

To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups by 2: 90 / 2 = 45

The average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice is 45.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the rate at which the boat is taking on water. We know that for every ten feet Julia rows, the boat takes on two liters of water. 

Since Julia rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, we can calculate her rowing speed as follows:

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 20 feet / 16 seconds
Speed = 1.25 feet/second

Now, we can calculate the time it takes Julia to row to the shore:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 64 feet / 1.25 feet/second
Time = 51.2 seconds

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we can calculate the total amount of water taken on as follows:

Total water taken on = (2 liters / 10 feet) * 64 feet
Total water taken on = 12.8 liters

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as B and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as D.

We are given that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, so we can write an equation:

6B = 1800

To find the value of B, we divide both sides by 6:

B = 1800 / 6
B = 300

Now, we are given that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. We can write another equation:

B = 50D

Substituting the value of B we found earlier, we get:

300 = 50D

To find the value of D, we divide both sides by 50:

D = 300 / 50
D = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

"To calculate Sasha's profit, we need to first calculate the total cost of the lumber and the total revenue from selling it.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $10 per board = $100.

The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $16 per board = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 per board.

The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 per board.

The total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $15 per board = $150.

The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $24 per board = $120.

The total revenue from selling all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

Sasha's profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles by 5: 20 / 5 = 4.

Therefore, 4 containers were imported on the second day."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up an equation to find Lylah's salary.

Let's denote Lylah's salary four years ago as x. Then, Adrien's salary four years ago would be 1.3x (since it's 30% higher). We know that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, so we can set up the equation:

1.3x = 40,000

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 1.3:

x = 40,000 / 1.3
x = 30,692.31

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,692.31.

Now, we know that Adrien's salary four years later is 40% higher than his salary four years ago. We can calculate his salary four years later by multiplying his salary four years ago by 1.4 (since it's 40% higher):

Adrien's salary four years later = 1.4 * 40,000
= 56,000

Since both Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, we can add their salaries four years later to find the total:

Total salary four years later = Adrien's salary four years later + Lylah's salary four years later
= 56,000 + (1.4 * 30,692.31)

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So, the total number of sheets used per week is 2 * 30 = 60 sheets.

Now, we multiply the number of sheets used per week by the number of weeks in a month (4):

60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the number of fruits each person brought and then add them together.

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, so the total number of fruits she brought is 5 + 8 = 13.

Kael brought twice the amount of apples, which is 2 * 5 = 10 apples. He also brought half the number of oranges, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges. So, the total number of fruits Kael brought is 10 + 4 = 14.

Now, we add the total number of fruits Morisette and Kael brought together: 13 + 14 = 27.

Therefore, Morisette and Kael have 27 fruits in total.

"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate the hours she slept each day.

On Monday, she slept 8 hours.
On Tuesday, she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours.
On Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less than Tuesday, so she slept 6 - 2 = 4 hours.
On Thursday, she slept 1 hour more than Wednesday, so she slept 4 + 1 = 5 hours.
On Friday, she slept 1 hour more than Thursday, so she slept 5 + 1 = 6 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours she slept each day:
8 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 29

The total hours Sadie slept throughout the week is 29."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 3 hours and the remaining 4 hours.

In the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. So, she covers a distance of 3 hours * 10 miles/hour = 30 miles.

In the remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 5 miles per hour. So, she covers a distance of 4 hours * 5 miles/hour = 20 miles.

To find the total distance covered in 7 hours, we add the distances covered in the two parts: 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand that Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. This means that the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters is equal to one-third of the original number of letters needing stamps.

Let's denote the original number of letters needing stamps as x. Since Jennie puts stamps on one-third of these letters, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters is x/3.

We are given that the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters is 30. So, we can set up the equation:

x/3 = 30

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 30 * 3
x = 90

This means that Jennie had 90 letters needing stamps initially. 

The final answer is: 90"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Initially, Julia bought a package of spoons, but the exact number is unknown. Let's call this number 'x'. 

Her husband also bought 5 spoons and gave them to Julia. So, the total number of spoons Julia had initially is x + 5.

Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so the number of spoons she had left after using 3 is (x + 5) - 3.

We are told that after setting the table, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. This means that the number of spoons she had left after using 3 is equal to 12. 

So, we can set up the equation: (x + 5) - 3 = 12.

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 2 = 12.

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: x = 10.

Therefore, the package that Julia bought initially contained 10 spoons.

"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages. 

First, we know Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. Since he bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, we can calculate the number of fish sausages by adding 6 to the number of chicken sausages. 

Number of fish sausages = 38 (chicken sausages) + 6 = 44

Now, we can find the total number of sausages by adding the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages.

Total number of sausages = 38 (chicken sausages) + 44 (fish sausages) = 82

The final answer is: 82"
"To find the total number of friends Amy and Lily have together, we need to add the number of friends each of them has. 

Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily has 50 friends, we can calculate Amy's friends as follows: 
Amy's friends = Lily's friends + 20
Amy's friends = 50 + 20
Amy's friends = 70

Now, we add the number of friends Amy and Lily have together:
Total friends = Amy's friends + Lily's friends
Total friends = 70 + 50
Total friends = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to first determine the cost of each item.

Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs 15$, a watermelon costs 3 * 15 = 45$.

An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so an orange costs 45 - 5 = 40$.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each item:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * 45 = 180$
- 20 peppers: 20 * 15 = 300$
- 10 oranges: 10 * 40 = 400$

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is 180 + 300 + 400 = 880$."
"To calculate the profit, we need to first calculate the total time spent on patients per day and then the total revenue from both the hospital and the patients.

Total time spent on patients per day = 500 patients * 24 minutes per patient = 12,000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The hospital charges the patients $200 an hour, so the total revenue from patients per day is:
500 patients * $200 per patient = $100,000

The hospital charges the doctors $150 an hour, so the total revenue from doctors per day is:
200 hours * $150 per hour = $30,000

The total revenue per day is the sum of the revenue from patients and doctors:
$100,000 + $30,000 = $130,000

The cost of seeing each patient is the time spent on each patient multiplied by the doctor's hourly wage:
200 hours * $150 per hour = $30,000

The total cost per day is the cost of seeing all patients:
$30,000 * 500 patients = $15,000,000

The profit per day is the total revenue minus the total cost:
$130,000 - $15,000,000 = -$14,870,000

The hospital makes a loss of $14,870,000 per day.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of elves who quit after the first incident and then subtract that from the total number of elves.

Initially, Nissa hires 60 elves.

A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. 
A third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20 elves.

So, 20 elves quit, leaving 60 - 20 = 40 elves.

Then, 10 more elves quit after kids kick their shins.

40 - 10 = 30 elves.

Therefore, there are 30 elves left.

"To determine the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the number of tickets used for the roller coaster and the luge rides separately and then add them together.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she used 2 + 2 = 4 rides. Since each ride costs 6 tickets, Pam used 4 * 6 = 24 tickets.

Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he used 4 + 2 = 6 rides. Since each ride costs 6 tickets, Fred used 6 * 6 = 36 tickets.

In total, Pam and Fred used 24 + 36 = 60 tickets that day.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many miles Walt walked on Tuesday. Since he walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday, and he walked 4 miles on Monday, we can calculate the miles walked on Tuesday as follows:

Miles walked on Tuesday = 6 * miles walked on Monday
Miles walked on Tuesday = 6 * 4
Miles walked on Tuesday = 24

Now, we know that Walt walked a total of 41 miles from Monday through Wednesday. We also know that he walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total miles walked:

Miles walked on Wednesday = Total miles walked - (Miles walked on Monday + Miles walked on Tuesday)
Miles walked on Wednesday = 41 - (4 + 24)
Miles walked on Wednesday = 41 - 28
Miles walked on Wednesday = 13

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5. 

Brian initially had 20 video games but lost 5, so he now has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Now, we know that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. We can represent this as an equation: 

Bobby's video games = 3 * Brian's video games - 5

Substituting the value of Brian's video games (15) into the equation, we get:

Bobby's video games = 3 * 15 - 5
Bobby's video games = 45 - 5
Bobby's video games = 40

The final answer is 40."
"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we first need to determine the total number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the total unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we can calculate this as follows:

Total unicorns = 27
Unicorns in Scottish Highlands = Total unicorns / 3 = 27 / 3 = 9

Now, we know that two thirds of the unicorns in the Scottish Highlands are female. To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we can calculate this as follows:

Female unicorns in Scottish Highlands = Unicorns in Scottish Highlands * 2/3 = 9 * 2/3 = 6

Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

The cost of the cookies is 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

The delivery fee is 20% of $20.00, which is 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00
The total cost of the order is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

"To determine the number of questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the total number of questions he completed in both tests and subtract that from the total number of questions.

For the first test, Mark completed 5 questions per hour for 8 hours, so he completed 5 * 8 = 40 questions.

For the second test, Mark completed 5 questions per hour for 6 hours, so he completed 5 * 6 = 30 questions.

The total number of questions Mark completed is 40 + 30 = 70.

The total number of questions on both tests is 75 + 100 = 175.

Therefore, Mark left 175 - 70 = 105 questions incomplete.

"To solve this problem, we need to translate the given information into an equation. Let's denote the number of blue gumballs as B and the number of pink gumballs as P. The problem states that there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. This can be written as:

P = 4B + 22

We are also given that there are 12 blue gumballs, so B = 12. We can substitute this value into the equation:

P = 4(12) + 22
P = 48 + 22
P = 70

Therefore, there are 70 pink gumballs.

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to first determine the total number of semi-automatic cars. Since there are 20 cars in total, and 12 are automatic and 4 are manual, we can subtract these from the total to find the number of semi-automatic cars.

20 (total cars) - 12 (automatic cars) - 4 (manual cars) = 4 (semi-automatic cars)

Now, we can calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars by dividing the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiplying by 100.

(4 / 20) * 100 = 20%

Therefore, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W. 

We are given the following information:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: W = 2B
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: B = 2Q
3. The total number of bees is 700: W + B + Q = 700

We can substitute the first two equations into the third one to get:
2B + B + Q = 700
3B + Q = 700

Now, we can substitute B = 2Q into the equation:
3(2Q) + Q = 700
6Q + Q = 700
7Q = 700

Dividing both sides by 7, we get:
Q = 100

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees:
B = 2Q
B = 2 * 100
B = 200

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees:
W = 2B
W = 2 * 200
W = 400

"To calculate the total cost, we need to first find the total cost of the food items and the total cost of the non-food items. 

The total cost of the food items is 2 dollars (milk) + 3 dollars (eggs) = 5 dollars.

The total cost of the non-food items is 3 dollars (light bulbs) + 3 dollars (cups) + 4 dollars (roach traps) = 10 dollars.

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate 10% of 10 dollars, which is 1 dollar. 

The total cost of the non-food items with tax is 10 dollars + 1 dollar = 11 dollars.

The total cost of everything is the sum of the total cost of the food items and the total cost of the non-food items with tax, which is 5 dollars + 11 dollars = 16 dollars.

"To calculate Kim's profit, we need to first calculate his total expenses and total income.

Total income: Kim has 3 clients and 5 potential clients, so he has a total of 8 clients. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. Therefore, the total number of bottles of bleach needed is 8 * 2 = 16, and the total number of packs of cloths needed is 8 * 1 = 8.

The total cost of bleach is 16 * $2 = $32, and the total cost of cloths is 8 * $5 = $40. Therefore, Kim's total expenses are $32 + $40 = $72.

Total income is given as $92. 

Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, so Kim's profit is $92 - $72 = $20.

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we need to calculate the number of harvests in a year. 
There are 12 months in a year, so:
12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests per year

The third lego set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first one, so it has 1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the number of pieces in each set together: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

Therefore, Johnny picks up 2125 legos if he picks up all the legos.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. 

In the next 6 hours, half of those bees return, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.

So, at this point, the total number of bees that have left and returned is 30 (initially left) + 15 (returned) = 45 bees.

In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as initially left (2 * 30 = 60 bees) leave the hive.

Now, we need to find out how many of these 60 bees have already returned. We know that 15 bees returned in the previous 6 hours, so 60 - 15 = 45 bees have left in the last 6 hours.

However, we are asked to find out how many bees return in the last 6 hours. Since all the bees that left before that hadn't already returned return in the next 6 hours, we need to find out how many bees left in the first two 6-hour periods. 

We know that 30 bees left initially and 15 returned, so 30 - 15 = 15 bees left in the first 6 hours. Then, 60 bees left in the next 6 hours, and 15 of those had already returned, so 60 - 15 = 45 bees left in the last 6 hours.

Therefore, all 45 bees that left in the last 6 hours return to the hive.

To find Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides by 3:

Dorothy's friends = 12 / 3
Dorothy's friends = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James's friends by multiplying Dorothy's friends by 4, since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy:

"To determine the winner and the waiting time, we need to calculate the time it takes for each person to reach home.

First, we need to convert the distances to the same units. Since Steve's speed is given in feet per minute, we'll convert Tim's distance to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile, so:

2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each person to reach home:

Time = Distance / Speed

For Steve: Time = 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile / 440 feet/minute = 60 minutes

For Tim: Time = 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 60 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will be the winner. 

The waiting time for the loser (Tim) is the difference between the time it takes for the winner (Steve) to reach home and the time it takes for the loser (Tim) to reach home:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Dave ate 14 fries, leaving the pack with 5/7 of the original amount.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 7 fries. So, the pack now has 5/7 - 7 = -2 fries. However, since we can't have negative fries, we need to re-evaluate this step. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 7 fries. So, the pack now has 5/7 of the original amount minus 7 fries. To simplify, let's express 5/7 as a decimal: 5/7 ≈ 0.7143. So, the pack now has 0.7143 * original amount - 7 fries.
3. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries. The pack now has 0.7143 * original amount - 7 - 9 fries.
4. The raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries. To find the remaining fries, we need to express 2/3 as a decimal: 2/3 ≈ 0.6667. So, the raccoon ate 0.6667 * (0.7143 * original amount - 16) fries.
5. The pack now has 0.7143 * original amount - 16 - 0.6667 * (0.7143 * original amount - 16) fries.
6. The ants ate 1 fry, leaving 5 fries behind. So, the pack now has 0.7143 * original amount - 16 - 0.6667 * (0.7143 * original amount - 16) - 1 fries.

Now, let's simplify the equation:

0.7143 * original amount - 16 - 0.6667 * (0.7143 * original amount - 16) - 1 = 5

Combine like terms:

0.7143 * original amount - 0.6667 * (0.7143 * original amount) - 17 = 5

0.7143 * original amount - 0.5 * 0.7143 * original amount - 17 = 5

0.2143 * original amount - 17 = 5

0.2143 * original amount = 22

original amount = 22 / 0.2143

original amount ≈ 102.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a fry, we can round down to the nearest whole number. The pack had approximately 102 fries when Dave bought it."
"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the total hours for each type of day and then add them together.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so that's 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 of these days in a week, the total hours for these days is 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 of these days in a week, the total hours for these days is 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week.

Now, we need to calculate the total hours for the entire semester. There are 16 weeks in a semester, so we multiply the weekly hours by 16. 

For the 3 days with 1-hour classes: 9 hours/week * 16 weeks = 144 hours
For the 2 days with 2-hour classes: 8 hours/week * 16 weeks = 128 hours

Total hours = 144 hours + 128 hours = 272 hours

"To determine the winner, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so he covers the entire length of the field (100 yards) 15 times. This means he runs 15 * 100 = 1500 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, covering 100 yards, and then runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards. She does this 34 times. So, she runs 100 + 80 = 180 yards per round, and 180 * 34 = 6120 yards.

Since 6120 yards is greater than 1500 yards, Kelly wins the contest. 

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance: 6120 - 1500 = 4620 yards.

"To determine the number of tadpoles Finn can see, we need to subtract the number of tadpoles that are hiding from the total number of tadpoles initially present.

Initially, Finn saw 11 tadpoles.
6 tadpoles came out from under a lily pad, so now there are 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles.
Then, 2 tadpoles hid under a rock, so we subtract 2 from 17, which is 17 - 2 = 15 tadpoles.

Therefore, Finn can see 15 tadpoles in the pond now.

"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the depth on Tuesday. 

The depth on Monday was 17 feet. On Tuesday, the depth increased by 7 feet, so the depth on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

On Wednesday, the depth is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find the depth on Wednesday, we multiply the depth on Tuesday by 2/3. 

Depth on Wednesday = (2/3) * 24 = 16 feet.

The final answer is 16."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of fish each person caught and then add them together.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the number of fish each person caught:
Anakin: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19
Locsin: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

The total number of fish they caught is 19 + 13 = 32.

"To calculate the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to apply the 20% increase every two months. 

First, let's break down the 36 months into 18 two-month periods. 

The initial cost of the bag of marbles is $20. 

After the first two months, the price increases by 20% of $20, which is $4. So, the new price is $20 + $4 = $24.

After the next two months, the price increases by 20% of $24, which is $4.80. So, the new price is $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.

This pattern continues, and we can calculate the price after each two-month period:

- After 4 months: $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56
- After 6 months: $34.56 + $6.91 = $41.47
- After 8 months: $41.47 + $8.29 = $49.76
- After 10 months: $49.76 + $9.95 = $59.71
- After 12 months: $59.71 + $11.94 = $71.65
- After 14 months: $71.65 + $14.33 = $85.98
- After 16 months: $85.98 + $17.20 = $103.18
- After 18 months: $103.18 + $20.36 = $123.54
- After 20 months: $123.54 + $24.71 = $148.25
- After 22 months: $148.25 + $29.65 = $177.90
- After 24 months: $177.90 + $35.78 = $213.68
- After 26 months: $213.68 + $42.74 = $256.42
- After 28 months: $256.42 + $50.88 = $307.30
- After 30 months: $307.30 + $61.26 = $368.56
- After 32 months: $368.56 + $73.71 = $442.27
- After 34 months: $442.27 + $88.45 = $530.72
- After 36 months: $530.72 + $106.14 = $636.86

The final answer is: 636.86"
"To determine the total value of all the toys, we need to establish the cost of each toy based on the given information.

We know that one red car costs $4. Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and an action figure costs $5, the doll costs 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, we have the cost of one red car ($4) and the doll ($15). We also know there are 5 red cars. So, the total cost of the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

The total cost of the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

The total cost of all the toys is the sum of the costs of the red cars, the doll, and the action figures. Therefore, the total cost is $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the income she would have earned by doing her taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the income she would have earned by doing her taxes herself. She would lose 3 hours of freelance work, which would result in a loss of $35/hour. So, the total loss would be:

3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, let's calculate the cost of hiring the accountant. The accountant charges $90.

To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the total loss:

$105 (loss) - $90 (cost) = $15

Therefore, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

"To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer accessories she purchased.

The total cost of the accessories is the sum of the costs of the scanner, CD burner, and printer. 

Total cost of accessories = €157 (scanner) + €74 (CD burner) + €102 (printer) 
Total cost of accessories = €333

Now, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from the initial budget of €1500.

Money left for clothing = Initial budget - Total cost of accessories
Money left for clothing = €1500 - €333
Money left for clothing = €1167

The final answer is: 1167"
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we need to divide the total number of eggs required for the Spanish flans by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting job.

Total eggs required for 15 flans = 15 * 3 = 45 eggs
Eggs received per babysitting job = 9 eggs

Number of babysitting jobs required = Total eggs required / Eggs received per job
= 45 / 9
= 5

Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times to have enough eggs for 15 Spanish flans.

"To solve this problem, let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can express this relationship as S = 2B.

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This can be expressed as (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Substituting S = 2B into the equation, we get (2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Combine like terms: 3B + 4 = 28.

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3B = 24.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 8.

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into S = 2B, which gives us S = 2 * 8 = 16.

Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between Jimmy's and Ethel's money. The problem states that Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. 

Let's denote Ethel's money as E. According to the problem, Jimmy's money is 2 times Ethel's money plus $2. This can be expressed as 2E + 2.

We are given that Ethel has $8. So, we can substitute E with 8 in the equation: 2(8) + 2.

Now, we calculate the value: 2(8) = 16, and adding 2 to that gives us 18.

Therefore, Jimmy has $18.

"To determine the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the miles he walks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, Pancho walks 20 miles per day. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so he walks 5 * 20 = 100 miles on weekdays.

On weekends, Pancho walks 10 miles per day. There are 2 weekend days in a week, so he walks 2 * 10 = 20 miles on weekends.

To find the total miles walked in a week, we add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants, and then add them together.

The hat costs $25. The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 * $25 = $75.

The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2: ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

Therefore, each uniform costs $150.

We know Sally Thirty-two is 8 years old. Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirty-two, Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we can calculate the total age of the four birds: 8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) + 8 (Sally Thirty-two) = 51.

"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to calculate the total monthly payment and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the total minimum payment: 
$300 (student loans) + $200 (credit card) + $500 (mortgage) = $1000

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum payment:
50% of $1000 = 0.5 * $1000 = $500

Now, we add this amount to the total minimum payment to get the new monthly payment:
$1000 (minimum) + $500 (50% more) = $1500

To find the yearly payment, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:
$1500 * 12 = $18,000

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To determine the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato, then multiply that by the total number of potatoes.

Since it takes 1.5 minutes to peel a potato and 5 seconds to cut it, we need to convert the time to seconds for consistency. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 1.5 minutes is 1.5 * 60 = 90 seconds.

Now, we add the time it takes to peel and cut each potato: 90 seconds (peeling) + 5 seconds (cutting) = 95 seconds per potato.

Since there are 60 potatoes, we multiply the time per potato by the total number of potatoes: 95 seconds * 60 potatoes = 5700 seconds.

To convert this to minutes, we divide by 60: 5700 / 60 = 95 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total revenue and total cost. 

Let's start with the total revenue. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10. Since they made $25 in profit, their total revenue must be $25 + $3 (cost of lemons and sugar) = $28.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of lemons and sugar. We know that the total revenue is $28 and the cost of sugar is $2 per gallon. Since they made $25 in profit, the total cost of lemons and sugar must be $28 - $25 = $3. 

Since the cost of sugar is $2 per gallon, the cost of lemons must be $3 - $2 = $1 per gallon.

Chinese participants = Total participants - Japanese participants
Chinese participants = 240 - 80
Chinese participants = 160

Now, we know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

"To find out how much money Zaid will have left, we need to calculate his expenses and donations step by step.

First, we calculate the total amount Zaid spends on rent and car fuel. 

Rent: 1/4 of 6000 = 600
Car fuel: 1/3 of 6000 = 2000
Total spent on rent and car fuel: 600 + 2000 = 2600

Now, we subtract this amount from Zaid's total salary to find the remaining amount.
6000 - 2600 = 3400

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to charity. Half of 3400 is 1700.
3400 - 1700 = 1700

Zaid also gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$. The total amount given away is 200 + 700 = 900.

Now, we subtract this amount from the remaining amount.
1700 - 900 = 800

Therefore, Zaid will have 800$ left after all these expenses and donations.

To find the total number of crabs, we add the number of crabs each person has: 40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122 crabs.

The total number of crabs the three have together is 122."

For the second week, Lloyd tutored 8 hours at $10 per hour, so he earned 8 x $10 = $80.

To find the total earnings for the first two weeks, we add the earnings from each week: $50 + $80 = $130.

The total amount Lloyd earned for the first two weeks is $130."

The number of votes the loser got is 20."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of red roses and white carnations. We know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. This means the number of red roses is 4x.

We also know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations. Since Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, we can set up the equation 5x = 200 to find the value of x.

Solving for x, we get x = 200 / 5 = 40.

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote Jan's current age as J, Mark's current age as M, and Jean's current age as E.

From the given information, we know:
1. Jean is two years older than Mark, so E = M + 2.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age, so M - 2 = (J - 2) / 2.

We are also given that Jan is 30 years old, so J = 30.

Substituting J = 30 into the second equation, we get:
M - 2 = (30 - 2) / 2
M - 2 = 28 / 2
M - 2 = 14
M = 16

Now that we know Mark's age, we can find Jean's age using the first equation:
E = M + 2
E = 16 + 2
E = 18

Therefore, Jean is 18 years old.

"To determine the winning time of the faster team, we first need to calculate the total time taken by each team. 

The faster team's time for each leg is 55 seconds. Since there are four members, the total time for the faster team is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner runs 60 seconds. The subsequent runners are 3 seconds faster than the previous one. So, the times for the subsequent runners are 60, 57, 54, and 51 seconds.

To find the total time for the less well-rounded team, we add the times for each leg: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The difference in their times is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds. Therefore, the faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of two independent events: rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is 3/6, since there are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. This simplifies to 1/2.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2), since the events are independent. There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die (2, 4, and 6), so the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6, and the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 3/6. 

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (3/6) * (3/6) = 9/36 = 1/4.

Now, we can find the difference in probability by subtracting the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/4) * 100 = 25%.

Therefore, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

Jenna's apples = 20 / 2
Jenna's apples = 10

Now, to find the total number of apples they both picked, we add Jenna's apples to her mom's apples.

Total apples = Jenna's apples + Mom's apples
Total apples = 10 + 20
Total apples = 30

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of straw pieces used among the hamsters and rabbits. 

The hamsters have 10 cages, each with 5 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw pieces used among the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

The rabbits have 20 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw pieces used among the rabbits is 20.

The total number of straw pieces used among the hamsters and rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70.

Since the total number of straw pieces distributed among the small rodents is 160, the number of straw pieces used among the rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'x'. Then, the total number of straw pieces used among the rats is 3x * 6 = 18x.

Since the total number of straw pieces used among the rats is 90, we can set up the equation 18x = 90 and solve for 'x'. 

Dividing both sides of the equation by 18, we get x = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 rats in each cage."

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue. 

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. The total cost is the cost of buying the bags plus the cost of transportation. The total revenue is the selling price of the bags.

Total cost = (cost per bag * number of bags) + (transportation cost per bag * number of bags)
Total cost = 20x + 2x
Total cost = 22x

Total revenue = selling price per bag * number of bags
Total revenue = 30x

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost. We are given that the profit is $400.

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
400 = 30x - 22x

Initially, Tom has 50 trees.

Each year, Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, resulting in a net gain of 8 trees per year.

Over 10 years, the net gain would be 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we need to calculate 30% of the total number of trees after 10 years.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards. So, now she has 80 + 40 = 120 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokémon cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number is 60 + 40 = 100 cards. Twice that number is 2 * 100 = 200 cards. So, now she has 120 + 200 = 320 cards.

Therefore, Elaine now has 320 Pokémon cards.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we can divide the total number of sentences by 2.

1000 sentences / 2 = 500 sentences per publisher

Since Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, we can calculate the total amount Mark earns from Publisher A:

500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, we can calculate the total amount Mark earns from Publisher B:

500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we add the amounts from both publishers:

2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

Mark makes 7500 cents in a week."
"To determine the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the total number of pails he gets and then multiply it by the amount of water in each pail.

Baldur gets 5 pails of water in the morning and 6 pails of water in the afternoon. So, the total number of pails he gets in a day is 5 + 6 = 11 pails.

Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, the total amount of water he gets in a day is 11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters.

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider the monetary reward and the raise in salary.

First, let's calculate the monetary reward: $5000.

Since John received the award on the first day of the year, he will receive the raise for the entire year. The raise is 5% of his weekly salary, which is $2000. 

5% of $2000 is 0.05 * $2000 = $100. 

So, the total raise for the year is $100 * 52 weeks = $5200.

Now, let's calculate John's total earnings for the year:

- His base salary for the year is $2000 * 52 weeks = $104,000.
- The monetary reward is $5000.
- The total raise is $5200.

Total earnings = $104,000 + $5000 + $5200 = $110,200.

Therefore, John's total earnings for the year are $110,200.

"To determine the total number of barrels of wine produced, we need to calculate the total number of tons of grapes produced and then multiply it by the number of barrels produced per ton.

First, we calculate the total number of tons of grapes produced per year: 
10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons

Next, we multiply the total number of tons by the number of barrels produced per ton: 
50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

Therefore, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.

"To determine the total number of cheese slices Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal and then add them together.

Carl ate a sandwich for lunch every day, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he used 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. So, for 3 days, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

Carl also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese, using 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add up the slices of cheese Carl used: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices of cheese.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the number of pens she initially had and then add the pens she bought.

Initially, Janet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. So, the total number of pens she initially had is 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens, each containing 9 pens, so she got 6 x 9 = 54 blue pens. She also bought 2 bags of red pens, each containing 6 pens, so she got 2 x 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, we add the pens she initially had to the pens she bought: 32 (initial pens) + 54 (blue pens) + 12 (red pens) = 98 pens.

Janet now has 98 pens.

"To find the required score, we first need to calculate the total score Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93. Since there are six tests, the total score required for an average of 93 is 93 * 6 = 558.

We know Brinley's scores for the first five tests: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The sum of these scores is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 358.

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score among the given scores. The lowest score is 71.

To find the total score Brinley needs, we subtract the lowest score from the total required score: 558 - 71 = 487.

Now, we subtract the sum of the remaining scores from the total score Brinley needs: 487 - 358 = 129.

This means Brinley needs a score of 129 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

"To find the total number of kilometers Micheal rode his bike, we need to calculate the total kilometers he rode in the first four weeks and the total kilometers he rode in the last three weeks.

In the first four weeks, Micheal rode his bike 5 times a week, 25 kilometers each time. So, the total kilometers he rode in the first four weeks is 5 * 25 * 4 = 100 kilometers.

In the last three weeks, Micheal rode his bike 2 times a week, 60 kilometers each time. So, the total kilometers he rode in the last three weeks is 2 * 60 * 3 = 360 kilometers.

To find the total number of kilometers Micheal rode his bike, we need to add the total kilometers he rode in the first four weeks and the total kilometers he rode in the last three weeks. So, the total number of kilometers is 100 + 360 = 460 kilometers.

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately and then add them together.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, so each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. Since there are 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples together to get the total weight of the bag of candy: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

The final answer is: 2600"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cakes Rose bought each day and then add them together.

On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add the number of cakes she bought each day: 4 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 60 (Wednesday) = 76 cakes.

The total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 76."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since there are 6 plates in a dozen, half a dozen plates would be 3 plates. The cost of 3 plates is 3 * $6000 = $18000.

Now, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since twenty dozen cups is equivalent to 240 cups, we can set up an equation:

240 * cost of a cup = $18000 - $1200
240 * cost of a cup = $16800

To find the cost of a cup, we divide both sides by 240:

cost of a cup = $16800 / 240
cost of a cup = $70

The total cost of buying each cup is $70.

"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn to afford the jacket and shoes. 

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20, so the total cost is $30 + $20 = $50.

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs to earn $50 - $10 = $40 more.

She earns $5 per babysitting session and $4 per lawn mowing session. To find out how many babysitting sessions she needs to earn $40, we divide $40 by $5, which equals 8 sessions.

However, since she earns $4 per lawn mowing session, we need to find out how many sessions she needs to earn $40. We can divide $40 by $4, which equals 10 sessions.

Since she needs to earn $40 from babysitting and she can earn $5 per session, she will have enough money from babysitting after 8 sessions. However, she needs 10 sessions to earn $40 from mowing the lawn. 

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 - 8 = 2 more times to earn enough money to afford the jacket and shoes.

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so we can express this as w = r + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected each day is 42. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Therefore, we can set up the equation 3r + 5w = 42.

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42.

Expanding the equation, we get 3r + 5r + 10 = 42.

Combining like terms, we get 8r + 10 = 42.

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get 8r = 32.

Dividing both sides by 8, we get r = 4.

Therefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find the total time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park, as he is walking around its edge. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the dimensions of the park (1.5 miles by 6 miles), we can substitute these values into the formula:

P = 2(1.5 + 6)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Now, we can calculate the time Gary spends walking by dividing the perimeter by his walking speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day. We know that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. 

Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. On the second day, Sloane counted 50 more customers than the first day, so the number of customers on the second day is x + 50.

The total number of customers by the third day is the sum of the customers on the first two days, which is x + (x + 50). We are given that this total is 500.

So, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 50) = 500.

Combine like terms: 2x + 50 = 500.

Subtract 50 from both sides: 2x = 450.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 225.

Now that we know the number of customers on the first day (x = 225), we can find the number of customers on the second day: x + 50 = 225 + 50 = 275.

The number of customers on the third day is the sum of the customers on the first two days, which is 225 + 275 = 500.

However, we are asked to find the number of customers on the third day, which is 500."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool was 2x gallons.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the total amount of water lost from both pools in 4 minutes is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as 'y' gallons. This means the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y gallons.

Since the big pool initially had 2x gallons and lost 16 gallons, the current amount of water in the big pool is 2x - 16. We know this is equal to 4y, so we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4y

We also know that the small pool initially had x gallons and lost 16 gallons, so the current amount of water in the small pool is x - 16. We are told that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool, so we can set up another equation:

4y = x - 16

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x and y by substituting the expression for y from the second equation into the first equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)
2x - 16 = 4x - 64
-2x = -48
x = 24

Now that we know x, we can find y by substituting x into one of the equations:

4y = x - 16
4y = 24 - 16
4y = 8
y = 2

So, the small pool has 2 gallons of water now.

"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn. The total cost of the shoes and the belt is $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00.

Since she earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total amount she needs to earn by her hourly wage to find the number of hours she needs to work:

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

Therefore, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we first need to calculate the total amount she needs to pay back, which includes the initial $2000 and 10% of that amount.

10% of $2000 is $200. So, the total amount she needs to pay back is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Since she is paying $165 per month for 12 months, we can calculate the total amount she will pay as follows:

$165 * 12 = $1980

Now, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she needs to pay back to find her remaining balance:

$2200 - $1980 = $220

Janeth's remaining balance will be $220."
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to add the number of roses and dahlias. 

We know there are 4 roses. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias by adding 7 to the number of roses: 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias.

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of roses and dahlias: 4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15 flowers.

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet's age: 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack's age: 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian's age: 63 + 3 = 66 years

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3:

The average age of the three in three years will be 45."
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna.

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know that the total points scored by all four students is 251. We can subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total to find out how many points Jojo scored.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the combined rate at which Kalinda and her mom can complete the puzzle. 

Since Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute, her mom can add half of that, which is 2 pieces per minute. 

Combined, they can complete 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Since the puzzle has 360 pieces, we can divide 360 by their combined rate to find the time it takes to complete the puzzle: 

360 / 6 = 60 minutes

"To calculate the total cost, we need to break it down into several steps.

First, we calculate the total cost of the cars before tax and registration. Since Mark buys 12 cars at $20,000 each, the total cost is:

12 * $20,000 = $240,000

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars. The tax rate is 10%, so we multiply the total cost by 0.10:

$240,000 * 0.10 = $24,000

Now, we add the tax to the total cost:

$240,000 + $24,000 = $264,000

Finally, we calculate the total registration cost for all 12 cars, which is $1000 per car:

12 * $1000 = $12,000

Now, we add the registration cost to the total cost:

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many tomatoes Steve eats per week. Since he eats 6 tomatoes per day, we can multiply this by 7 to get the total number of tomatoes he eats per week.

6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we can assume his girlfriend eats half of what he eats. So, she eats 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes per week.

Now, we know that Steve eats 42 tomatoes per week and his girlfriend eats 21 tomatoes per week. To find the total number of tomatoes they eat per week, we add these two numbers together.

42 + 21 = 63 tomatoes/week

Since a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, we can divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by 3 to find the number of vines needed.

63 tomatoes/week ÷ 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the initial number of pens Ram buys and the number of new pens he can create from the ink of the used pens.

Initially, Ram buys 25 pens. When the ink runs low, he can mix the ink from 5 used pens to make 1 new pen. This means that for every 5 used pens, he gets 1 new pen.

Let's calculate the number of new pens Ram can create:

25 (initial pens) / 5 (used pens per new pen) = 5 new pens

So, Ram can create 5 new pens from the ink of the 25 used pens.

Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary's age is 25 - 2 = 23 years.

Now, we can find the sum of their ages: 20 (Jessa) + 25 (Joan) + 23 (Mary) = 68 years.

The sum of the ages of the three girls is 68."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A: 
   30% of 1000 students = 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students.

2. Calculate the number of students remaining after 300 students went out through exit A:
   1000 - 300 = 700 students.

3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B:
   3/5 of the remaining 700 students = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students.

4. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C:
   The remaining students after exit B = 700 - 420 = 280 students.

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of candies Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies, we can set up the equation:

2x = 54, where x is the number of candies Robert has.

Solving for x, we get:

x = 54 / 2
x = 27

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find the number of candies James has by adding 6 to Robert's amount:

James = 27 + 6
James = 33

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract James' amount from John's amount:

Difference = 54 - 33
Difference = 21

The final answer is: 21"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of books each person has and the number of books they read.

Dolly has 2 books and Pandora has 1 book. 

When Dolly reads Pandora's book, she adds 1 book to her collection. 
When Pandora reads Dolly's book, she also adds 1 book to her collection.

So, after reading each other's books, Dolly will have 2 (her original books) + 1 (Pandora's book) = 3 books.
Pandora will have 1 (her original book) + 1 (Dolly's book) = 2 books.

Therefore, the total number of books they collectively read is 3 (Dolly's books) + 2 (Pandora's books) = 5 books.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we need to find out how many letters Mike receives and responds to per week. Since he has 3 remaining penpals and they each send 2 letters a week, he receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters per week.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters per week.

Now, we need to find out how many pages he writes per week. Each letter is 5 pages long, so he writes 6 * 5 = 30 pages per week.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, we need to find out how many minutes he spends writing per week. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 7 = 420 minutes in a week.

Now, we can divide the total number of pages he writes per week by the number of minutes it takes him to write one page to find out how many minutes he spends writing per week. 30 pages / 6 minutes per page = 5 minutes per week.

To convert this to hours, we divide the total minutes by 60. 5 minutes / 60 = 1/12 hours per week.

The final answer is: 1/12"
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to first calculate the total minutes he has used so far. 

He has a 15-minute call with his boss every day, and there are 30 days in the month. So, the total minutes used for his daily calls with his boss is 15 * 30 = 450 minutes.

Additionally, he has had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. 

Now, let's add these two amounts together: 450 minutes (for his daily calls with his boss) + 300 minutes (for his extra calls) = 750 minutes.

Since Jason's phone plan is 1000 minutes per month, we subtract the total minutes used from his plan: 1000 - 750 = 250 minutes.

Therefore, Jason has 250 minutes left for the month.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 fries, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, but we don't know how many she gave yet. Let's call the number of fries Ginger gave 'x'. After Ginger gave her fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now, Griffin has 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We are given that Griffin ended up with 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27.

Solving for x, we get x = 20.

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails. According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Since x represents the number of fish in each aquarium, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

"To calculate the total amount Jean paid, we need to first calculate the total hours worked. 

She works 6 hours a day, 4 days a week, for 5 weeks. 
Total hours worked = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

Since she gets a 10% discount, the amount she pays is 90% of the total hours worked. 
Total cost = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000
Discount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000
Amount paid = Total cost - Discount = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

"To find out how much each person paid, we need to first calculate the total cost of all the party supplies. 

Total cost = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are 3 people in total. 

Cost per person = Total cost / Number of people
Cost per person = $96 / 3
Cost per person = $32

The final answer is 32."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total weight of the onions and then multiply it by the cost per pound.

The chef spent $300."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cookies each person ate and then find the difference in calories.

On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, who ate 13 cookies. So, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total calories consumed by each person. Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 20 * 200 = 4000 calories on Monday and 26 * 200 = 5200 calories on Tuesday. Her sister consumed 5 * 200 = 1000 calories on Monday and 13 * 200 = 2600 calories on Tuesday.

The total calories consumed by Sue is 4000 + 5200 = 9200 calories. The total calories consumed by her sister is 1000 + 2600 = 3600 calories.

The difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister is 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories.

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the school. Since the school is 50% girls, and there are 3 classes, we can calculate the total number of girls as follows:

Total number of girls = 50% of 3 classes = 0.5 * 3 = 1.5 classes

Since each class has 20 students, we can calculate the total number of students in the school as follows:

Total number of students = 20 students/class * 3 classes = 60 students

Since the school is 50% girls, the number of girls in the school is half of the total number of students:

Number of girls = 50% of 60 students = 0.5 * 60 = 30 girls

We already know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. To find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls:

Number of girls in the third class = Total number of girls - (Number of girls in the first class + Number of girls in the second class)
= 30 - (15 + 12)
= 30 - 27
= 3 girls

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 30. To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the number of girls in the third class from the total number of boys:

Number of boys in the third class = Total number of boys - Number of girls in the third class
= 30 - 3
= 27 boys

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many cougars Rick killed today. We know he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, and he killed 15 cougars the previous night. 

So, the number of cougars killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Now, we know Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today. Since he killed 12 cougars, the number of wolves he killed today is 3 * 12 = 36.

Now, let's add up the total number of animals Rick killed. He killed 10 wolves the previous night and 36 wolves today, and 15 cougars the previous night and 12 cougars today.

Total number of wolves = 10 + 36 = 46
Total number of cougars = 15 + 12 = 27

Total number of animals killed = 46 + 27 = 73

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many times Anne went down the water slide. 

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we can calculate this as follows:

Mitchel went down the slide 30 times.
Anne went down 30% less than Mitchel, which is 70% of 30.
70% of 30 is 0.7 * 30 = 21.

So, Anne went down the slide 21 times.

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. 
Robert went down the slide 4 * 21 = 84 times.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of cows Mr. Sylas has after buying 40 cows. 

Initially, there were 20 cows in each stall, and there are 10 stalls. So, the total number of cows is 20 * 10 = 200.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, so the total number of cows becomes 200 + 40 = 240.

Now, he divides the 240 cows equally among the 20 stalls. To find out how many cows are in each stall, we divide 240 by 20, which equals 12.

Since we are asked to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in each stall (12) by 8. 

12 * 8 = 96.

The final answer is 96."

Brady has $45 in his piggy bank."
"To find the total weight of the redwood, we first need to calculate the weight of the wood that the termites ate. Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, we can find the weight of the eaten wood by multiplying the total weight of the redwood by 0.3.

First, we need to find the total weight of the redwood. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can divide the total height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 to find the number of sections. 

200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections

Now, we can multiply the number of sections by the weight per section to find the total weight of the redwood.

20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds

Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, we can find the weight of the eaten wood by multiplying the total weight of the redwood by 0.3.

8000 pounds * 0.3 = 2400 pounds

Now, we can find the weight of the remaining wood by subtracting the weight of the eaten wood from the total weight of the redwood.

8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

Therefore, the redwood weighs 5600 pounds.

"To calculate the total amount Nancy owes, we need to first calculate the cost of the overdue books and then add the flat fee.

The cost of the overdue books is $0.50 per book, and she has 8 books. So, the total cost of the overdue books is 8 * $0.50 = $4.00.

Since she has at least one book that's over a week overdue, she has to pay the flat fee of $2.00.

The total amount she owes is the sum of the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee: $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

Therefore, Nancy owes the library a total of $6.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the number of bananas Jamal has and then calculate the total number of fruits.

Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples, we can find Jamal's apples by subtracting 8 from 52. 

Jamal's apples = 52 - 8 = 44

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal's bananas = 44 + 4 = 48

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea's bananas = 48 / 2 = 24

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas for both Andrea and Jamal.

Total fruits = Andrea's apples + Andrea's bananas + Jamal's apples + Jamal's bananas
Total fruits = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48
Total fruits = 128

"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we first need to calculate the amount of flour required for each day separately. 

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since two cups of flour are needed for a dozen (12) cookies, we can calculate the amount of flour needed for 36 cookies as follows:

36 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 3 dozen
3 dozen = 3 * 2 cups = 6 cups

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. We can calculate the amount of flour needed for 30 cookies similarly:

30 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 2.5 dozen
2.5 dozen = 2.5 * 2 cups = 5 cups

To find the total amount of flour Carla needs, we add the flour required for both days:

6 cups (today) + 5 cups (tomorrow) = 11 cups

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we need to find the time it takes for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees. Since it takes 40% longer than the initial 20 minutes, we calculate 40% of 20 minutes and add it to 20 minutes. 

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. 

So, the time it takes for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees is 20 + 8 = 28 minutes.

Next, we need to find the time it takes to cook the chicken. It takes 5 minutes less than the time it took to warm up the oil, so it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook the chicken.

Now, we need to find the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken. This is the sum of the time it took to warm up the oil and the time it took to cook the chicken.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette. 

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches used for the body, which is 900 stitches. 
So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know that the total number of stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette is 1800. 
So, the total number of stitches used for the sleeves is 1800 - (900 + 90 + 180) = 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total number of stitches used for the sleeves by 2 to find the number of stitches per sleeve. 
So, the number of stitches per sleeve is 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Substituting R = 6S into the second equation, we get:
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
Subtracting 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27
Subtracting 9 from both sides:
3S = 18
Dividing both sides by 3:
S = 6

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find the number of spots on each type of snake. 

Since the cobra has twice as many spots as the mamba, and the cobra has 70 spots, the mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

Now, we can calculate the total number of spots for each type of snake. 
Cobras: 40 * 70 = 2800 spots
Mambas: 60 * 35 = 2100 spots

The total number of spots for both types of snakes is 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

Half of the total number of spots is 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is: 2450"
"To determine the total number of people attending the soccer game, we need to calculate the number of team members and their guests. 

There are 12 team members, and each team member brings 2 guests. So, the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. 

Adding the team members and their guests, we get 12 + 24 = 36 people.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we need 36 / 3 = 12 pizzas.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost will be 12 * $15 = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we need to first calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones. Since there are 8 gemstones, each 1 inch long, the total length occupied by the gemstones is 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and the gemstones occupy 8 inches, so the remaining space for the silver beads is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Each silver bead is 1/4 inch long, so to find the number of beads, we divide the remaining space by the length of each bead: 17 / (1/4) = 17 * 4 = 68.

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

68"
"To calculate the total number of stories written, we need to first find out how many stories each person wrote in the second week. 

In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, so in the second week, she wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories. 
In the first week, Braylen wrote 40 stories, so in the second week, he wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories. 
In the first week, Margot wrote 60 stories, so in the second week, she wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

Now, we add up the total number of stories written by each person in both weeks. 
Alani's total stories: 20 + 40 = 60
Braylen's total stories: 40 + 80 = 120
Margot's total stories: 60 + 120 = 180

The total number of stories written altogether is 60 + 120 + 180 = 360."
"To find the brother's current age, we need to multiply Ann's age by 2 since he is twice her age.

"To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has and subtract the cost of the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, the total value of her quarters is 5 * 25 = 125 cents.

She also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, the total value of her dimes is 2 * 10 = 20 cents.

Now, let's add the value of her quarters and dimes: 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how many cents she will have left, we subtract the cost of the pop from the total amount of money she has: 145 - 55 = 90 cents.

Kelly will have 90 cents left.

"To find the total number of rows of 5 stars, we first need to determine the total number of stars on the flag. 

The flag has 3 rows of 8 stars, which is 3 * 8 = 24 stars. It also has 2 rows of 6 stars, which is 2 * 6 = 12 stars. 

The total number of stars is 24 + 12 = 36 stars. 

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the remaining stars must be 5-star rows. 

The number of 5-star rows can be found by subtracting the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total number of stars: 76 - 36 = 40 stars. 

Since each 5-star row has 5 stars, the number of 5-star rows is 40 / 5 = 8 rows."
"To determine the number of trucks needed, we need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones being transported. 

Since each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, the total weight of 80 flagstones is 80 * 75 = 6000 pounds.

Now, we need to divide the total weight by the weight capacity of each truck, which is 2000 pounds. 

6000 / 2000 = 3

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since it is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, its speed is 60 miles/hour / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance as the car in the fast lane."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of medals Ali has as A and the number of medals Izzy has as I. We know that Ali has 22 medals, so A = 22.

We also know that Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so I = A - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17.

The total number of medals they have together is A + I = 22 + 17 = 39.

The problem states that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means that the total number of medals they have is 1/10 of the total number of medals given out. Let's denote the total number of medals given out as T. Then, we can set up the equation:

A + I = (1/10)T

Substituting the values we know, we get:

22 + 17 = (1/10)T

Combine like terms:

39 = (1/10)T

Multiply both sides by 10 to solve for T:

390 = T

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390.

The final answer is: 390"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available. Since there are 4 adults and 8 children, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, we can calculate the total number of chocolate bars as follows:

4 adults * 6 chocolate bars/adult = 24 chocolate bars
8 children * 5 chocolate bars/child = 40 chocolate bars
Total chocolate bars = 24 + 40 = 64 chocolate bars

Since the remaining chocolate bars after giving 6 to each adult are to be shared equally among the children, we need to subtract the chocolate bars given to the adults from the total:

64 - (4 * 6) = 64 - 24 = 40 chocolate bars

Now, we can divide the remaining chocolate bars among the children:

40 chocolate bars / 8 children = 5 chocolate bars/child

Therefore, each child will get 5 chocolate bars."
"To determine how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total number of 10-minute intervals she works. 

First, let's break down her work period into intervals. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works for 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total minutes she works. 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.

Now, we need to divide the total minutes she works by 10 to find out how many 10-minute intervals she completes. 150 / 10 = 15 intervals.

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval. 15 * $5 = $75.

The final answer is 75."
"To find the initial points of each player, we can start by determining the points of each player before the fourth round.

Since Jim has 3 points less than Mike, and Mike has 21 points, we can calculate Jim's points as follows:
Jim's points = Mike's points - 3
Jim's points = 21 - 3
Jim's points = 18

Since Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, we can calculate Tony's points as follows:
Tony's points = 2 * Mike's points
Tony's points = 2 * 21
Tony's points = 42

Now, let's add up the points of all three players before the fourth round:
Total points before the fourth round = Mike's points + Jim's points + Tony's points
Total points before the fourth round = 21 + 18 + 42
Total points before the fourth round = 81

In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. Since all three players have more than 20 points, they will each receive an extra point. 

Now, let's add the extra points to the total points:
Total points after the fourth round = Total points before the fourth round + 3
Total points after the fourth round = 81 + 3
Total points after the fourth round = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges each son will wash and then subtract that from the total number of oranges.

The oldest son is 8 years old, so he will wash 8 oranges.

The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. He will wash 4 oranges.

In total, the two sons will wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Initially, Will had 15 oranges. After washing 12, he will have 15 - 12 = 3 oranges left unwashed.

"To find the total count of activities Darren has done in the two days, we need to calculate the number of each activity for each day and then add them together.

Day 1:
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Day 2:
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's add the total count of each activity for both days:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

The total count of activities Darren has done in the two days is 220 + 90 + 60 = 370."
"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week. 

Since each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

With 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

To find out how many days the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the daily consumption: 42 kg / 2 kg = 21 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of days by 7 to find out how many weeks the rice will last: 21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks.

The 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold. 

He sold 20 crates on the weekend, and 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday. 

Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates.

Since his target was 120 crates, we subtract the total crates sold from the target to find the difference.

Difference = 120 - 65 = 55 crates.

Therefore, Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week."
"To determine the cost of the desk to Carmen, we need to consider the sequence of bids. 

The bids start at $200 and increase by $50 each time. Since there are 3 other people who bid once, and Carmen bids after each of them, the sequence of bids would be as follows:

1. The first bid is $200.
2. The second bid is $250 (after the first person).
3. The third bid is $300 (after the second person).
4. The fourth bid is $350 (after the third person).
5. The fifth bid is $400 (after Carmen).

Since Carmen wins after the fifth bid, the cost of the desk to her is $400.

The final answer is: $400"
"To calculate the total cost of driving, we need to first calculate the total miles driven per year. Since John drives to work and back, the total distance per day is 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles. 

Since he goes to work 5 days a week, the total miles driven per week is 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles. 

Since he works for 50 weeks a year, the total miles driven per year is 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles.

The cost per mile driven is $2, so the total cost of driving per year is 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000.

Additionally, John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus paid per year is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

Therefore, the total cost of driving per year is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

"To determine how much time Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to find the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined. 

On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes. On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes. 

Total time exercised on Monday and Sunday = 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we multiply the total time by 2.

Time needed on Tuesday = 2 * 39 = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed, we need to consider the number of pages printed on each side of the paper. 

In this scenario, we have two sides: the left side and the right side. 

- The left side has 16 pages (pages 1-16).
- The right side has 16 pages (pages 17-32).

Since each piece of paper is used for both sides, we need 16 pieces of paper for the left side and 16 pieces of paper for the right side. 

Therefore, the total number of pieces of paper needed is 16 + 16 = 32.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of books Elise sold in the first year. Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, and she sold 45 books this year, she must have sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We know that she has 250 books in total and 50 unsold books, so the total number of books sold is 250 - 50 = 200. Since she sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books this year, the number of books sold in the first year is 90 + 45 = 135.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money she earned in the first year by multiplying the number of books sold by the price per book: 135 * 20 = 2700.

The total amount of money she earned in the second year is the same as the total amount of money she earned in the first year, since the price per book remains the same. Therefore, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is also 2700.

The final answer is: 2700"
"To calculate Watson's total earnings for April, we need to calculate his regular earnings and the bonus he received.

First, let's calculate his regular earnings for the month. Since he works 10 hours a day, 5 days a week, and there are approximately 30 days in April, his total hours worked in April would be:

10 hours/day * 5 days/week * 4 weeks = 200 hours

Since he earns $10 per hour, his regular earnings for April would be:

200 hours * $10/hour = $2000

Next, we need to add the bonus he received for the month. Since the company performed well for the whole month, he would receive a $300 bonus. 

So, his total earnings for April would be:

$2000 (regular earnings) + $300 (bonus) = $2300

The final answer is: $2300"
"To find the number of people John lost to, we need to calculate 20% of 20, since he beats 80% of the people.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning. Two-thirds of 60 loaves is (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves.

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. This would be 60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

Since half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening, we divide the remaining loaves by 2. So, 20 / 2 = 10 loaves are sold in the afternoon.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the rate at which Joey loses weight. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can calculate his weight loss rate as follows:

Weight loss rate = Total weight lost / Number of weeks
Weight loss rate = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weight loss rate = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy wants to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and her weight loss rate is 2 pounds per week, it will take her the same amount of time it takes Joey to lose 8 pounds.

However, the question states that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week. This is a trick question, as it implies that Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, which is not the case. Joey loses 2 pounds per week, and it would take him 4 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

Since Sandy's weight loss rate is 2 pounds per week, it will take her 4 weeks to lose 8 pounds, just like Joey. Therefore, the answer is 4 weeks.

"To determine how much Theo has to spend on gifts for his business partners, we first need to calculate the total cost of his trip. 

The cost of 6 business suits is 6 * $100 = $600. 
The cost of 3 suitcases is 3 * $50 = $150. 
The cost of a flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit, which is 5 * $100 = $500. So, the flight ticket costs $500 + $700 = $1200. 
The total cost of the trip is $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950. 

Since Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, he has $6000 - $2000 = $4000. 

Therefore, he has to spend $4000 - $1950 = $2050 on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

The remaining two people eat two eggs each day, so the total number of eggs consumed by this group is 2 * 2 = 4 eggs per day.

The total number of eggs consumed by the family in a day is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

The family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the age relationships between Trent, Jane, and Quinn. 

We know that Quinn is 30 years old. Since Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, Jane's age can be calculated as 30 - 3 = 27 years.

Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so Trent's age can be calculated as 27 + 5 = 32 years.

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote Noah's current age as N and Cera's current age as C. We are given that Cera is currently 46 years old, so C = 46.

We are also given that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. This means that six years ago, Noah's age was N - 6, and Cera's age was C - 6. Since Noah was half as old as Cera, we can set up the equation:

N - 6 = (1/2)(C - 6)

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Let's denote the population of Chile six years ago as P. We can set up the equation:

P = 3000(N - 6)

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. This means that the current population of Chile is 2P. We can set up the equation:

2P = current population of Chile

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. We can substitute the expression for P from the first equation into the second equation:

2(3000(N - 6)) = current population of Chile

Simplifying the equation, we get:

6000(N - 6) = current population of Chile

Now we can substitute C = 46 into the equation N - 6 = (1/2)(C - 6):

N - 6 = (1/2)(46 - 6)
N - 6 = (1/2)(40)
N - 6 = 20
N = 26

Now that we have found N, we can find the current population of Chile:

6000(N - 6) = 6000(26 - 6)
6000(20) = current population of Chile
120000 = current population of Chile

The final answer is: 120000"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'x'. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

The problem also states that there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is x/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms:

7x = 210

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 30

Therefore, there are 30 players on the defense.

"To determine the number of people who show up for Martha's party, we first need to calculate the total number of people invited. 

There are 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 * 6 = 12 people. 
There are 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 * 4 = 12 people. 
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people. 
We subtract these 2 people from the total number of people who were initially unable to attend: 16 - 2 = 14.

Therefore, 14 people show up for Martha's party."
"To find the total weight of marbles, we first need to calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has. 

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 

2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. 

So, Solomon's father gave him 8 marbles. 

Now, we add the marbles Solomon bought from Johanna (20) to the marbles his father gave him (8) to get the total number of marbles: 20 + 8 = 28.

The store already had 50 marbles. 

The total number of marbles in the store is 50 (initial marbles) + 28 (marbles bought and given by Solomon) = 78.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, the total weight of the marbles is 78 * 2 = 156 kgs.

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who left as follows:

1/4 * 40 = 10

This means 10 people left the party. 

We are given that 22 men stayed at the party. To find the number of women who stayed, we subtract the number of men who left from the total number of men and add the number of people who left:

Number of men who left = 1/4 * 25 = 6.25 (round down to 6 since we can't have a fraction of a person)

Number of men who stayed = 25 - 6 = 19

Now, we can find the number of women who stayed by subtracting the number of men who stayed from the total number of people who stayed:

Number of women who stayed = Total number of people who stayed - Number of men who stayed
= 40 - 19
= 21

Therefore, 21 women are left at the party.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the cost of the magazine first. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Next, we know that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. Therefore, the cost of the pen is $2 - $1 = $1.

The final answer is 1."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of pencils Jam has. We know that Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. 

Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as 'x'. Since Jam has 3 boxes, the total number of pencils in the boxes is 3x. Adding the 2 loose pencils, we get the equation: 3x + 2 = 26.

Solving for x, we get: 3x = 24, x = 8.

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Now, we know that Jam has 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 3*8 + 2 = 26 pencils.

Now, we need to find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have. We know that Meg has 46 pencils. So, the total number of pencils is 26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72.

Since each box contains 8 pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by 8 to find the number of boxes needed: 72 / 8 = 9.

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the effect of adding cream. 

First, let's calculate the total cooling effect of the ice cubes. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, and the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, we can calculate the number of ice cubes needed to achieve this cooling effect. 

Number of ice cubes = Total cooling effect / Cooling effect per ice cube
= 65 / 13
= 5

Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, the total weakening effect of the ice cubes is:

Total weakening effect of ice cubes = Number of ice cubes * Weakening effect per ice cube
= 5 * 12
= 60 milliliters

Now, let's consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. This will further weaken the coffee by 15 milliliters.

Total weakening effect = Total weakening effect of ice cubes + Weakening effect of cream
= 60 + 15
= 75 milliliters

Therefore, Shannon's iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the ratio of old records to new records. We know that for every 2 old records, 1 new record is obtained. 

Given that 5 people come in and leave with 7 new records, we can set up an equation to represent the situation. Let's assume the number of old records brought in by the 5 people is x.

Since each person trades 2 old records for 1 new record, the total number of old records traded is 2x. However, this is the total number of old records traded, not the total number of old records brought in. Since 5 people are involved, the total number of old records brought in is 5x.

We know that the 5 people leave with 7 new records, so the total number of new records obtained is 7. Since each person gets 1 new record, the total number of new records obtained is equal to the total number of old records traded, which is 2x. However, this is not the case here, as the total number of new records is 7, not 2x.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of junior programmers and then the number of senior programmers. 

Given that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, and there are 100 employees in total, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100 = 40

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, and junior programmers are paid $2000 per month, we can calculate the salary of senior programmers as follows:

Salary of senior programmers = $2000 + $400 = $2400

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month:

Total amount = (Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers) + (Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers)
= (40 * $2000) + (60 * $2400)

"To determine the time required to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to hours.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so the remaining charge is 100% - 60% = 40%.

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time required to charge the remaining 40% as follows:

40% / 1% = 40 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time to hours by dividing by 60:

40 minutes / 60 = 2/3 hours

Therefore, it will take 2/3 hours to fully charge the phone.

"To determine the amount the customer paid, we need to calculate the total amount they spent after applying the rewards and the coupon.

First, the customer spent $80 and used their rewards, which is $1 off for every $20 spent. Since they spent $80, they earned $4 in rewards ($80 / $20 = 4). 

However, the customer also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since the rewards were $4, the coupon took $8 off the price (2 * $4 = $8). 

So, the total discount is $4 (rewards) + $8 (coupon) = $12.

Now, subtract the total discount from the original price: $80 - $12 = $68.

Therefore, the customer paid $68 on this shopping trip.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in the smallest group as x. Since the other two groups are equal in number, each of them has x + 10 students.

We know that the total number of students is 200, so we can set up the following equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x + 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x + 20 = 200

Subtract 20 from both sides:

3x = 180

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 60

Therefore, the smallest group has 60 students.

Combine like terms: 3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3: x = 20

Now that we know the number of cows (x = 20), we can find the number of chickens: 2x = 2 * 20 = 40

Now, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. 

Total number of legs = (number of chickens * 2) + (number of cows * 4)
Total number of legs = (40 * 2) + (20 * 4)
Total number of legs = 80 + 80
Total number of legs = 160

Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, and it weighs the same as a blue beetle, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal and the container itself. 

The total weight is the sum of the weights of the animals and the container: 
50 (frog) + 50 (beetle) + 50 (toad) + 60 (snake) + 30 (bird) + 20 (container) = 260 pounds.

The final answer is: 260"
"To find the total number of baby outfits Laurel has, we need to add the outfits she received from her friend, the new outfits she received at the baby shower, and the outfits her mom gifted her.

Laurel initially received 24 outfits from her friend.
At the baby shower, she received twice that amount, which is 2 * 24 = 48 outfits.
Her mom gifted her 15 more outfits.

Now, let's add all the outfits together: 24 + 48 + 15 = 87

Laurel has 87 baby outfits for her baby."
"To determine the total distance Tyson covered in June, we first need to calculate the new daily distance he runs after taking his coach's advice. 

Initially, Tyson runs 5000 meters per day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters, which is 5000 * 1/5 = 1000 meters. 

So, the new daily distance is 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters.

Since June has 30 days, the total distance covered in June would be 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.

180,000"
"To find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we need to first determine the price of Juice Box B. Since Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, and Juice Box A is 4 dollars, Juice Box B is 4 + 5 = 9 dollars.

Now, we know Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, which is 4 dollars. So, Juice Box C is 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

To find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we subtract the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C. 11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

The final answer is: 2"
"To calculate the total number of legs, we need to multiply the number of tables by the number of legs each table has.

For the tables with 4 legs: 40 tables * 4 legs = 160 legs
For the tables with 3 legs: 50 tables * 3 legs = 150 legs

Now, we add the total number of legs from both types of tables: 160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs

The total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310."
"To determine how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and her husband.

Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

The total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since the bag has 36 cookies, the number of cookies left for Jenny to eat is 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies.

"To find the total cost of the shirts after the discount, we need to first calculate the original total cost of the shirts and then apply the discount.

The original total cost of the shirts is 2 shirts * $30/shirt = $60.

Since Davos got a 40% discount, we need to calculate 40% of the original total cost and subtract it from the original total cost.

40% of $60 is 0.4 * $60 = $24.

Now, subtract the discount from the original total cost: $60 - $24 = $36.

So, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.

"To find the increase in production, we need to calculate the daily revenue and production before and after the change.

Before the change:
Daily revenue = 10 tractors * $100/tractor = $1000
Daily production = 10 tractors

After the change:
Daily revenue = 5 silos * $220/silo = $1100
Daily production = 5 silos

To find the percentage increase in revenue, we can use the formula:
Percentage increase = ((New value - Old value) / Old value) * 100
Percentage increase in revenue = (($1100 - $1000) / $1000) * 100 = 10%

However, the question asks for the percentage more they are making per day now, which seems to be a misunderstanding. Assuming the question is asking for the percentage increase in revenue, the answer is 10%.

If the question is asking for the percentage increase in production, we can calculate it as follows:
Percentage increase in production = ((5 - 10) / 10) * 100 = -50%

Since the production decreased, the percentage increase is negative."
"To calculate the total monthly expenditure on the dog, we need to first calculate the weekly expenditure and then multiply it by 4.

The weekly expenditure on food is $25. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly expenditure on food is $25 * 4 = $100.

The monthly expenditure on treats is $20.

The monthly expenditure on medicine is $100.

The total monthly expenditure on the dog is $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220.

To calculate the yearly expenditure, we multiply the monthly expenditure by 12. 

$220 * 12 = $2,640.

The final answer is: 2640"
"To determine the total time of Peyton's after-work activities, we need to calculate the time for each activity and add them together.

Monday's yoga class is 1 hour.
Tuesday's cooking class is three times as long as Monday's yoga, so it is 3 * 1 = 3 hours.
Wednesday's cheese-tasting event is half an hour, which is 0.5 hours.
Thursday's museum tour is half as long as the cooking class, so it is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours.
Friday's errands are 2 hours.

Now, let's add up the time for all activities: 
1 (Monday) + 3 (Tuesday) + 0.5 (Wednesday) + 1.5 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 8 hours.

The total time for Peyton's after-work activities is 8 hours."
"To determine the number of plant pots April has left over, we need to calculate the total number of pots she needs for the daisies and roses, then subtract that from the total number of pots she initially bought.

She needs 30 plant pots for the daisies and twice as many for the roses, which means she needs 30 * 2 = 60 plant pots for the roses. 

The total number of pots needed is 30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = 90 plant pots.

Since April initially bought 100 plant pots, the number of pots she has left over is 100 - 90 = 10 plant pots.

"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent and gave away from the total amount she had initially.

Andrea initially had $36. She spent $11 on a sweater and gave her brother $4. 

First, let's add the amount she spent and gave away: $11 (sweater) + $4 (given to her brother) = $15

Now, subtract this amount from the initial amount: $36 (initial amount) - $15 (amount spent and given away) = $21

So, Andrea saved $21.

"To find the total time John spent on vacation, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them up.

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. 

He watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so he spent 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows.

The total time spent on these activities is 6 (boating) + 3 (swimming) + 6 (watching shows) = 15 hours.

Since 30% of his time was spent watching shows, we can set up an equation to find the total time spent on vacation. Let's call the total time spent on vacation 'x'. 

30% of x is equal to 15 hours, so 0.3x = 15. 

To find x, we divide both sides by 0.3: x = 15 / 0.3 = 50.

Since John spent 40% of his time sightseeing, we can find the time spent sightseeing by multiplying 40% (or 0.4) by the total time spent on vacation (50 hours): 0.4 * 50 = 20 hours.

The final answer is: 20"
"To determine how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and subtract the amount she already has in her savings.

First, let's calculate her earnings from the first job: 
20 hours * $10/hour = $200

Next, let's calculate her earnings from the second job: 
15 hours * $5/hour = $75

Now, let's add her earnings from both jobs: 
$200 + $75 = $275

Since Annabelle already has $80 in her savings, we subtract this amount from her total earnings: 
$275 - $80 = $195

Annabelle still needs $195 to save for the phone.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the height of the second tree, which is 5 feet more than the shortest tree. 

The shortest tree is 6 feet tall, so the second tree is 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.

Now, we know the combined height of the two shorter trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet. 

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the two shorter trees, so the tallest tree is 2 * 17 = 34 feet tall.

"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he bought and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he had.

The total cost of the toy cars is 6 * $2 = $12.
The total cost of the teddy bears is 5 * $1 = $5.
The total cost of the items Dean bought is $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially had $28. After buying the items, he had $28 - $17 = $11.
His mother then gave him an extra $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

The final answer is 21."
"To determine the number of friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has available for the activities. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do:

- 1 round of mini-golf: $5
- Arcade tokens: $5
- 2 rides on the go-karts: 2 * $10 = $20

Total cost: $5 + $5 + $20 = $30

Now, let's subtract the total cost from her budget: $90 - $30 = $60

Since each friend will also get $5 in arcade tokens, we need to subtract this amount from the remaining budget: $60 - $5 = $55

Now, we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend (including the arcade tokens): $55 / $10 = 5.5

Since we can't invite half a friend, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Morgan can invite 5 friends to her party."
"To find out how much money Marisa saves, we need to calculate the total amount she spends on lollipops and subtract that from her daily pocket money.

Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day. She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, which is 4 * 0.25 = $1.

So, the amount she saves each day is $5 - $1 = $4.

Since she saves for 5 days, the total amount she saves is $4 * 5 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Billy spent on gumballs. Since each gumball costs $0.05 and he bought 40 gumballs, the total cost of gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since Billy took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, the amount of money he had left is also $2. This means he had $10 - $2 = $8 left.

Now, we know that the candy costs $1.5 per pound. Let's denote the number of pounds of candy Billy bought as 'x'. The total amount of money he had left ($8) is equal to the cost of the candy (1.5x) plus the cost of the gumballs ($2). So, we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 2 = 8

Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us:

1.5x = 6

Dividing both sides by 1.5 gives us:

x = 4

Therefore, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S. 

We know that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, so we can write the equation as:

C = 2S - 5

We also know that Carver is 45 years old, so we can substitute C with 45:

45 = 2S - 5

Now, we can solve for S by adding 5 to both sides of the equation:

45 + 5 = 2S - 5 + 5
50 = 2S

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

50 / 2 = 2S / 2
25 = S

Therefore, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To determine the total distance traveled by the train in one trip, we need to calculate the distance from the first city to the third city. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles, and from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the other two segments, which is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. 

So, the distance from the third city to the first city is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance traveled in one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance by the service interval: 18,000 / 900 = 20 days.

The train goes between services for 20 days."
"To determine the amount of stuffing needed, we first need to find the average amount of stuffing for a collie bed. 

The amount of stuffing for a Rottweiler bed is 8 pounds, and for a chihuahua bed is 2 pounds. The average of these two is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of stuffing for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. 

For 4 chihuahua beds, we need 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing. 
For 3 collie beds, we need 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.

The total amount of stuffing needed is 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time taken for the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the journey and then add them together.

First, we calculate the time taken for the trip to his friend's house:
Distance = 200 miles
Speed = 70 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 200 / 70 = 2.86 hours

Next, we add the detour:
Total distance to his friend's house = 200 + 10 = 210 miles
Time taken for the detour = 210 / 70 = 3 hours

Now, we calculate the time taken for the trip back home:
Distance = 240 miles
Speed = 80 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 240 / 80 = 3 hours

Total time taken for the entire trip = Time taken to his friend's house + Time taken for the detour + Time taken to come back home
Total time = 2.86 + 3 + 3 = 8.86 hours

The final answer is: 8.86"
"To find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to subtract the number of absent students from the total number of students. 

First, we subtract the number of absent girls from the total number of girls: 
96 (total girls) - 5 (absent girls) = 91 girls present.

Since we know the total number of students is 96, we can subtract the number of girls present from the total number of students to find the number of boys present:
96 (total students) - 91 (girls present) = 5 boys present.

However, we are asked to find the number of boys at the school on Friday, not the number of boys present. Since 4 boys were absent, we add the number of boys present to the number of absent boys:
5 (boys present) + 4 (absent boys) = 9 boys.

Therefore, there were 9 fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday.

Now, to find the total number of kids in the park, we need to add the number of boys and girls together.

Total number of kids = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of kids = 3 + 6
Total number of kids = 9

"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test, we need to first calculate the total points she has so far. 

She scored 15 points on the first test and 18 points on the second test. 

15 + 18 = 33 points

Since she needs at least 42 points in total, we subtract the points she has so far from the required total to find the minimum points she needs on the third test.

42 - 33 = 9 points

Therefore, Jane must score at least 9 points on the third test to pass.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as x. According to the problem, 3x - 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 

We also know that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, so 3(3x - 5) were kicked out for physical violence.

The total number of people kicked out is 50. We can set up an equation to represent this:

x (refusing to wear masks) + (3x - 5) (shoplifting) + 3(3x - 5) (physical violence) = 50

Combine like terms:

x + 3x - 5 + 9x - 15 = 50

Combine like terms:

13x - 20 = 50

Add 20 to both sides:

13x = 70

Divide both sides by 13:

x = 5.38 (round down to 5 since we can't have a fraction of a person)

Now that we know x, we can find the number of people kicked out for shoplifting and physical violence:

Shoplifting: 3x - 5 = 3(5) - 5 = 10

Physical violence: 3(3x - 5) = 3(10) = 30

Now, we can find the number of people kicked out for other reasons by subtracting the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence from the total:

50 - 5 - 10 - 30 = 5

Therefore, 5 people were kicked out for other reasons.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 as 'x'. 

Since Erin now has three times more points than Sara, we can write the equation as: 
x + 14 = 3 * 8

Simplifying the equation, we get:
x + 14 = 24

Subtracting 14 from both sides, we get:
x = 10

So, Erin had 10 points before scoring 14.

"To calculate the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to break down the costs into several components.

1. Picture frames: 44 seniors * $20 per frame = $880
   Since each frame needs to be etched with a logo, we need to add 20% of the cost of the frame. 
   20% of $20 is $4, so the total cost of the etched frames is $20 + $4 = $24 per frame.
   The total cost of the etched frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. Pins: 2 seniors will receive pins, so the total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. Cords for officers: 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 44 * 1/4 = 11 officers.
   The total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we add up the costs of the picture frames, etched frames, pins, and cords to get the total cost of the senior gifts.
$880 + $1056 + $10 + $132 = $2078.

The final answer is: $2078"
"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the cost of the materials first. 

Let's assume the cost of materials is x. 

Since the DIY costs 20% less than the market price, we can set up the equation:

x + 20% of 400 = 400 - 20

20% of 400 is 0.2 * 400 = 80. 

So, the equation becomes:
x + 80 = 400 - 20
x + 80 = 380

Subtracting 80 from both sides:
x = 300

Now that we know the cost of materials is $300, we can find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper:
Total cost = cost of materials + cost of labor
Since the problem doesn't mention the labor cost, we assume it's zero.

Total cost = 300

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $300."
"To determine the total number of tennis shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and then add them together.

On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did the day before, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs, so we need to subtract those from the total.

"To calculate the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to find the number of faulty pieces of equipment and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

Given that 40% of the equipment were faulty, we can calculate the number of faulty pieces as follows:

Number of faulty pieces = 40% of 400,000
= 0.4 * 400,000
= 160,000

Since the total number of pieces is 400,000, the number of functioning pieces is:

Number of functioning pieces = Total number of pieces - Number of faulty pieces
= 400,000 - 160,000
= 240,000

The total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is the value of these pieces, which is:

Total amount spent on functioning pieces = Value of functioning pieces

Since Mary has 30 sheep, she has 15 sheep in each half. 

She gets 1 kg of milk from half of the sheep, which is 15 sheep. So, the milk from this half is 15 * 1 = 15 kg.

She gets 2 kg of milk from the other half, which is also 15 sheep. So, the milk from this half is 15 * 2 = 30 kg.

Now, we add the milk from both halves: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

Therefore, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of rolls left after feeding the children. Since Mrs. Sherman started with a dozen (12) and fed 6 children, she has 12 - 6 = 6 rolls left.

Then, she broke each of the remaining rolls into 8 pieces. To find the total number of pieces, we multiply the number of rolls by the number of pieces each roll was broken into: 6 rolls * 8 pieces/roll = 48 pieces.

Therefore, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

Now, we are left with 40 - 20 = 20 pupils who do not like blue. One-fourth of these 20 pupils like green. To find out how many pupils like green, we divide 20 by 4: 20 / 4 = 5 pupils who like green.

The rest of the pupils who do not like blue or green like yellow. We already know that 20 pupils do not like blue, and 5 of those like green. So, the number of pupils who like yellow is 20 - 5 = 15.

Therefore, 15 pupils like the color yellow.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of apples Lucy picked each day and then calculate the total number of apples.

On Monday, Lucy sold all the apples she picked, and she got $56. Since each apple is sold at $4, we can calculate the number of apples she picked on Monday by dividing the total amount she got ($56) by the price per apple ($4).

Number of apples picked on Monday = Total amount / Price per apple
= $56 / $4
= 14 apples

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday. So, she picked 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, let's calculate the total number of apples picked over the three days:
Total number of apples = Apples picked on Monday + Apples picked on Tuesday + Apples picked on Wednesday
= 14 + 12 + 24

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the monthly interest and add it to the principal amount. 

First, we need to calculate the total interest for five months. 

Total interest = Principal * Rate * Time
Total interest = $3,650 * 10% * 5 months
Total interest = $3,650 * 0.1 * 5
Total interest = $1,825

Now, we need to add the total interest to the principal amount to get the total amount Karan has to pay.
Total amount = Principal + Total interest
Total amount = $3,650 + $1,825
Total amount = $5,475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we need to divide the total amount by 5.
Monthly payment = Total amount / Number of months
Monthly payment = $5,475 / 5
Monthly payment = $1,105

Axel has 50 silver pesos and Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so Anna has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. 

Axel has 80 gold pesos and Anna has 40 more gold pesos, so Anna has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 (Axel) + 100 (Anna) = 150.

The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 (Axel) + 120 (Anna) = 200.

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 (silver) + 200 (gold) = 350.

"To determine Millie's profit per hour, we first need to calculate the total number of cups of lemonade she can make with the initial investment. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she buys enough supplies for 3 pitchers, she can make 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

Next, we need to calculate the total revenue generated from selling the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1 and she sells 4 cups per hour, her revenue per hour is 4 * $1 = $4.

Now, we need to calculate the cost of making the lemonade. Since she spends $18 on supplies and she can make 36 cups of lemonade, the cost per cup is $18 / 36 = $0.5 per cup. Her total cost per hour is 4 * $0.5 = $2.

To find the profit per hour, we subtract the total cost per hour from the revenue per hour: $4 - $2 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the initial amount of land as 'x'. 

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, the amount he sold is 3/5 * x. The amount he has left is 2/5 * x, which is given as 12.8 hectares.

So, we can set up the equation: 2/5 * x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2 to isolate x: 
x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

Therefore, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, the choir has 52 members, with 50% boys and 50% girls. This means there are 26 boys and 26 girls.

The choir decides to perform with just its female members, so they will sing with 26 girls.

However, half the people performing can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down. This means half of the 26 girls won't be able to perform. Half of 26 is 13, so 13 girls won't be able to perform.

The choir's 3 teachers will also sing with them, so we need to add these 3 teachers to the number of girls who can perform. 26 - 13 = 13 girls can perform, and adding the 3 teachers, the total number of people singing is 13 + 3 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores. 

First, we add the scores: 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 400

"To determine how much David saves, we need to calculate the cost of buying tickets for both of them and compare it to the cost of buying a ride bracelet for both of them.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying tickets for both of them. Each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, so the cost of one ride is 2 * 2 = $4. Since they want to ride all 9 rides, the total cost of tickets for both of them would be 9 * 4 = $36.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying a ride bracelet for both of them. The cost of a ride bracelet is $30, which gives 9 rides. Since they want to ride all 9 rides, the cost of buying a ride bracelet for both of them is $30.

To find out how much David saves, we subtract the cost of buying a ride bracelet from the cost of buying tickets: 36 - 30 = $6.

David saves $6 by buying a ride bracelet instead of buying tickets."
"To determine how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to divide the total amount of ribbon she has by the total number of gifts she wants to make bows for.

First, let's calculate the total number of gifts: 
6 (for her family) + 4 (for her friends) + 2 (for her teachers) = 12 gifts

Now, let's divide the total amount of ribbon by the total number of gifts:
144 inches / 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.

"To find the number of popsicles each person has, we can use the ratio. Let's assume the common multiplier for the ratio is x. 

The total number of popsicles is 5x + 6x = 165. 

Combine like terms: 11x = 165.

Divide both sides by 11: x = 15.

Now that we know x, we can find the number of popsicles each person has. Betty has 5x = 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles, and Sam has 6x = 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the amount of money Tim saves by canceling his cable subscription, we need to calculate the cost of the streaming services he chooses.

First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services. The cost of Netflix is $10 per month. The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 per month each, but since he gets a 20% discount for bundling, the cost of each of these services will be 80% of their original price. 

80% of $10 is $8. Since he is getting two of these services, the total cost for Hulu and Disney Plus will be $8 + $8 = $16.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the streaming services: $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

The cost of the cable package is $60. To find the amount of money Tim saves by canceling his cable subscription, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package: $60 - $26 = $34.

Therefore, Tim saves $34 by canceling his cable subscription.

"To find the total work time, we need to convert all the time to the same unit. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, we can convert 4 hours to minutes as follows: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the total work time:
- Writing time: 240 minutes
- Recording time: 240 minutes / 2 = 120 minutes
- Editing time: 90 minutes
Total work time: 240 + 120 + 90 = 450 minutes

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we can divide the editing time by the total work time and multiply by 100:
(90 minutes / 450 minutes) * 100 = 20%

"To find the total number of books Wendy needs, we first need to calculate the total capacity of the shelving system. Since it has 6 rows and 6 columns, the total capacity is 6 * 6 = 36 books.

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in the system. Double the capacity is 2 * 36 = 72 books. To find 20 more than this, we add 20 to 72, which equals 92 books.

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

92"
"To determine the total number of Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we need to calculate the initial number of cards she had, the number of cards she received, and the number of cards she gave away.

Initially, Erica made 20 Valentine's cards. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made cards, each containing 15 cards. So, the total number of pre-made cards she received is 2 * 15 = 30.

The total number of cards Erica initially had is the sum of the cards she made and the cards she received: 20 + 30 = 50.

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so the total number of cards she gave away is 24 + 5 = 29.

To find the total number of cards Erica now has, we subtract the number of cards she gave away from the total number of cards she initially had: 50 - 29 = 21.

Therefore, Erica now has 21 Valentine's Day cards.

"To find out how many slices are left, we first need to determine the total number of slices that Jenny gave away. 

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill and 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 12 in this case. 

1/3 can be written as 4/12, and 1/4 can be written as 3/12. 

So, Jenny gave away 4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12 of the pizza.

Since the pizza has 12 slices, we can find the number of slices given away by multiplying 7/12 by 12. 

7/12 * 12 = 7

Now, we know that Jenny gave away 7 slices. Since she started with 12 slices and ate 2, the number of slices left is 12 - 7 - 2 = 3.

The final answer is 3."
"To determine how many days Mark needs to save his money, we need to divide the cost of the bike by the amount he earns per day.

Mark needs 30 days to save enough money to buy the bike."
"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs first.

The number of millipedes is 1/3rd the number of spiders, which is 1/3 * 90 = 30.

The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12, which is 2 * 30 - 12 = 48.

Now, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs to find the total number of bugs: 90 + 30 + 48 = 168.

The total number of bugs Nancy counted is 168."
"To find the difference in age between Alice and Erica, we first need to determine the ages of Alice and Beth. 

Since Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years younger than Erica, Beth's age is 30 - 5 = 25 years.

Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice's age is 25 + 7 = 32 years.

The difference in age between Alice and Erica is 32 - 30 = 2 years.

"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of each ingredient required for the quadruple batch.

For the quadruple batch, Mark needs 4 times the amount of the normal recipe. So, he needs 4 * 3 cups of flour = 12 cups of flour. Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, he needs 12 / 2 = 6 bags of flour.

Similarly, for the quadruple batch, Mark needs 4 times the amount of milk. So, he needs 4 * 1 cup of milk = 4 cups of milk. Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, he needs 4 / 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour: 6 - 2 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days. 

First, we calculate the energy used per day: 
900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (or 7.2 kilowatt-hours, since 1 kilowatt-hour = 1000 watt-hours)

Next, we calculate the energy used in 30 days: 
7.2 kilowatt-hours * 30 days = 216 kilowatt-hours

Now, we need to calculate the energy used when the air conditioner is used for 3 hours a day (8 hours - 5 hours = 3 hours). 
Energy used per day: 
900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours (or 2.7 kilowatt-hours)

Next, we calculate the energy used in 30 days: 
2.7 kilowatt-hours * 30 days = 81 kilowatt-hours

Now, we subtract the energy used in 30 days with reduced usage from the energy used in 30 days with full usage to find the energy saved: 
216 kilowatt-hours - 81 kilowatt-hours = 135 kilowatt-hours

Adding the zebra with 36 stripes, we have 34 + 36 = 70 stripes. 
The zebra with half the number of stripes of the second zebra has 36 / 2 = 18 stripes. 
Adding this to the total, we have 70 + 18 = 88 stripes. 

To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras, which is 3. 
88 / 3 = 29.33. 

The average number of stripes is 29.33."
"To determine the total cost of the ingredients, we first need to calculate the total number of muffaletta sandwiches required. Since each sandwich serves 4 people and there are 20 people watching the game, we divide 20 by 4 to get 5 sandwiches.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required. Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, so we need 5 pounds of each. 

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so 5 pounds of meat will cost 5 x $7.00 = $35.00. 

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so 5 pounds of cheese will cost 5 x $3.00 = $15.00.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese: $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

The final answer is: $50."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in his house.

We know that Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, we can set up an equation to find the number of corns: 

Let's denote the number of corns as C. Since there are twice as many corns as cannolis, we can write the equation as: C = 2 * 40
C = 80

However, this is incorrect because we are told that Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. This implies that the initial number of corns is actually 40 fewer than the number of cannolis. So, the correct equation is: C = 40 - 40
C = 0

This doesn't make sense, as we can't have 0 corns. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

We know that Allan bought 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns. Let's denote the initial number of cannolis as C and the initial number of corns as C/2. 

The initial number of cannolis is 40, so C = 40. The initial number of corns is C/2 = 40/2 = 20.

Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total of cannolis is 40 + 60 = 100.

Allan bought 40 fewer corns, so the new total of corns is 20 - 40 = -20. However, we can't have a negative number of corns. This implies that the initial number of corns was actually 40 more than the number of cannolis. So, the correct equation is: C = 2 * 40 + 40
C = 120

Now we can find the new total of corns: 120 - 40 = 80.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 + 80 = 180.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of steps Elliott completed before his jog. 

Elliott finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. He also did 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, the total steps completed before his jog is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we need to subtract the remaining steps from the total steps he completed before his jog. 

Steps taken during the jog = Total steps completed before jog - Remaining steps
Steps taken during the jog = 6,000 - 2,000
Steps taken during the jog = 4,000

"To determine how many minutes it will take Toby to finish the book, we need to calculate the total number of words in the book and then divide it by his reading rate.

The book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page, so the total number of words is 45 * 200 = 9000 words.

Toby can read 300 words per minute, so the time it will take him to finish the book is 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes.

Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 10 minutes to get there, so he will arrive at the airport 60 - 10 = 50 minutes after he finishes the book.

Since it will take him 30 minutes to finish the book, he will arrive 50 - 30 = 20 minutes early.

40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours/week = $24,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 of 40 employees left the company. So, 10 employees left, and 30 employees remained.

The remaining 30 employees worked for the full 40 hours in June. The total amount paid to the employees in June is:

30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours/week = $18,000

"To determine how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds, and the first pound is full price ($3), the second pound is half off ($3 * 0.5 = $1.50). So, the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50, and the 4 magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1. So, the total cost of the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1 = $2.50.

Now, let's add the cost of the taffy and the seashells and magnets to find the total cost of the items Sally purchased: $4.50 + $2.50 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the probability of a candle exploding and the probability of a candle smelling like wet dog.

Given:
- The probability of a candle exploding is 5% or 0.05.
- The probability of a candle smelling like wet dog is also 5% or 0.05.

Since these are independent events, we can multiply the probabilities to find the probability of both events occurring together. 

Probability of a candle smelling like wet dog and exploding = Probability of exploding * Probability of smelling like wet dog

Discount per blouse = 30% of $20 = 0.3 * $20 = $6

Now, we subtract the discount from the regular price to get the discounted price:

Discounted price per blouse = $20 - $6 = $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

Total cost = 4 * $14 = $56

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into variables and equations. 

Let's denote the number of apples gathered from the tallest trees as T, the number of apples gathered from the shortest trees as S, and the number of apples gathered from the average trees as A.

From the problem, we know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so T = 30. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister's T = 2 * 30 = 60.

Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as her sister, so S = 0.5 * S. Since her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, her S = 3 * S. This implies that S = 0.5 * 3 * S = 1.5 * S. Therefore, S = 1.5 * S, which means S = 0.

Since the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, we can set up the equation: T + S + A = 500. Substituting the values we know, we get 30 + 0 + A = 500.

Solving for A, we get A = 500 - 30 = 470.

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, the total number of bumps can be represented as 2C + D = 304.

We also know that the total number of heads is 180, and since each animal has one head, we can represent this as C + D = 180.

Now we have two equations:

1) 2C + D = 304
2) C + D = 180

We can solve these equations simultaneously. Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1), we get:

2C + D - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into equation (2) to find the number of dromedaries:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts. 

First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days. He traveled 200 kilometers every day, so the total distance for the first 4 days is 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.

Next, we need to calculate the distance Tom traveled in the next 2 days. He traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers.

Now, let's add the distance traveled in the first 6 days (4 days + 2 days) to the distance traveled in the last 2 days of the second week. Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day for 2 days, so the total distance for the last 2 days is 300 * 2 = 600 kilometers.

The next 8 months cost $12 per month, so the total cost for the next 8 months is 8 * $12 = $96.

The final 20 months cost $14 per month, so the total cost for the final 20 months is 20 * $14 = $280.

Now, we add the costs of all three periods: $48 + $96 + $280 = $424.

Therefore, 2 years of the service cost Bill $424.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the original price of the tattered jeans is x + 6.

Cole bought both jeans and saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. This means he saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans and 2/3 of the savings from the tattered jeans.

The amount saved from the jogger jeans is 1/3 * (x - 6) = (1/3)x - 2. The amount saved from the tattered jeans is 2/3 * (x + 6) = (2/3)x + 4.

The total savings is the sum of the savings from both jeans, which is equal to $6. So, we can set up the equation:

(1/3)x - 2 + (2/3)x + 4 = 6

Combine like terms:

(1/3)x + (2/3)x = 6 - 2 + 4
(1/3)x + (2/3)x = 8

Combine the fractions:

(3/3)x = 8
x = 8

Now that we know the original price of the jogger jeans, we can find the original price of the tattered jeans:

x + 6 = 8 + 6
x + 6 = 14
x = 8

However, this would mean the jogger jeans cost the same as the tattered jeans, which is not possible. Let's re-evaluate the equation.

The correct equation should be:

(1/3)x - 2 + (2/3)(x + 6) = 6

Simplify the equation:

(1/3)x - 2 + (2/3)x + 4 = 6

Combine like terms:

(1/3)x + (2/3)x = 6 - 2 + 4
(1/3)x + (2/3)x = 8

Combine the fractions:

(3/3)x = 8
x = 8

However, this is still not correct. Let's re-evaluate the equation again.

The correct equation should be:

(1/3)x - 2 + (2/3)(x + 6) = 6

(1/3)x + (2/3)x = 8

Combine the fractions:

(1/3)x + (2/3)x = 8

To get rid of the fractions, multiply both sides by 3:

x + 2x = 24

"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and add them together.

The 4 buses can hold 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
The 6 minibusses can hold 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
The 10 minivans can hold 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, let's add the capacities of all the vehicles together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

Therefore, a total of 570 employees can join the day trip.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder. 

Let's denote the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders as x. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is x + 10.

We know that Lillian builds 3 homemade feeders and buys 3 store-bought feeders. So, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10), and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x.

Since the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same, we can set up the equation:

3(x + 10) = 3x

Expanding the equation, we get:

3x + 30 = 3x

Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get:

30 = 0

This equation is not true, which means that the initial assumption that the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same is incorrect. However, we can still solve for x by setting up another equation.

Let's say the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is y. Then, we can set up the equation:

3(x + 10) + 3x = y

Combine like terms:

3x + 30 + 3x = y

Combine like terms again:

6x + 30 = y

Now, we know that the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10), and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x. Since the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is y, we can set up the equation:

3(x + 10) + 3x = y

We also know that the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10), and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x. Since the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is y, we can set up the equation:

3(x + 10) + 3x = y

Since the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same, we can set up the equation:

3(x + 10) = 3x + 30

Expanding the equation, we get:

3x + 30 = 3x + 30

Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get:

30 = 30

This equation is true, which means that the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is indeed the same.

Now, we can find the value of x by using the information that each type of feeder attracts 20 birds. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, the store-bought feeders attract 20 - 10 = 10 birds.

So, 3 store-bought feeders attract 3 * 10 = 30 birds.

Since the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same, the homemade feeders also attract 30 birds.

Now, we know that 3 homemade feeders attract 30 birds, so each homemade feeder attracts 30 / 3 = 10 birds.

Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, the store-bought feeders attract 10 - 10 = 0 birds.

However, this is not possible, as the store-bought feeders must attract some birds. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The bagel costs $4. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, so the soup costs $4 + (25% of $4) = $4 + $1 = $5.

The cake is half the price of the bagel, so the cake costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add the costs of the bagel, soup, and cake together: $4 + $5 + $2 = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much money Kenny has after selling the cards. We know he has $50 in spending cash and he plans to keep 1/3 of the cards, but we don't know how many cards he has. Let's call the total number of cards 'x'. 

Since Kenny sells the cards for $1.5 each, the total amount of money he gets from selling the cards is 1.5x. He keeps 1/3 of the cards, so he sells 2/3 of the cards. 

We know that the total amount of money Kenny has after selling the cards is $100 (the cost of the amusement park ticket) plus the $50 he already has. So, the equation becomes:

1.5x = 100 + 50
1.5x = 150

To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 150 / 1.5
x = 100

So, Kenny started with 100 cards.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of hotdogs the caterer prepared. Since the caterer prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs, and there are 36 guests, the caterer prepared 36 / 2 = 18 hotdogs for the first round. However, since everyone wanted a second hotdog, the total number of hotdogs needed is 36 guests * 2 = 72 hotdogs.

Since the caterer only prepared 18 hotdogs, there aren't enough hotdogs for everyone to get a second hotdog. To find out how many guests did not get a second hotdog, we subtract the number of hotdogs prepared from the total number of hotdogs needed: 72 - 18 = 54.

Therefore, 54 guests did not get a second hotdog.

"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we first need to find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Indras has 6 letters, so half of that is 6 / 2 = 3. 

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than that, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Now, we need to find the total number of letters in both names. 

The total number of letters is 6 (Indras) + 7 (sister) = 13.

The final answer is 13."
"To calculate the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to first find the total cost of the items before the discount. 

The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00, the cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00, and the cost of the utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00. 

The total cost of the items before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Since the items are 20% off, we need to calculate 20% of $165.00. 20% of $165.00 is 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost before the discount: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

Therefore, Charlotte's order after the 20% discount is $132.00.

"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and subtract the amount of money she already has.

The total cost of the items is: $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19.

Dora has $2 (from her allowance) + $16 (from her mother) = $18.

To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1.

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of dragons each prince slew.

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, which is 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, which is 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, which is 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

Therefore, Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons.

"To find out how many gallons Josey needed, we first need to determine the amount of gas in each container. Since 15 gallons were divided equally into 5 containers, we can divide 15 by 5 to find the amount in each container.

15 gallons / 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

Since Josey needed 1/4 of a container, we can multiply the amount in each container by 1/4.

3 gallons * 1/4 = 3/4 gallon

To convert gallons to pints, we know that 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints. So, we can multiply 3/4 gallon by 8 pints per gallon.

(3/4) * 8 pints = 6 pints

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much money George spent on chips. Since each bag of chips costs 40 cents and he bought 3 bags, the total cost of chips is 3 * 40 = 120 cents.

George started with $5, which is equivalent to 500 cents. After spending 120 cents on chips, he had 500 - 120 = 380 cents left. Since he had 1% of his money left, we can calculate the amount of money he had left as 1% of 500 cents, which is 5 cents.

Now, we can subtract the amount of money he had left from the amount he had after buying chips to find out how much he spent on candy bars. 380 - 5 = 375 cents.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can divide the amount he spent on candy bars (375 cents) by the cost of each candy bar (75 cents) to find out how many candy bars he bought. 375 / 75 = 5.

Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends. 

First, we need to find out how many lollipops Ray shared with his friends. He had 25 lollipops initially and kept 5 for himself. 

25 (initial lollipops) - 5 (lollipops kept by Ray) = 20 lollipops shared

Now, we divide the shared lollipops by the number of friends: 

20 (shared lollipops) / 4 (number of friends) = 5 lollipops per friend

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the two pieces that Rory and her mom each have from the total weight of the cake.

Rory and her mom each have a piece, so together they have 2 pieces. Since the cake is cut into 8 pieces, the weight of the two pieces they have is 2/8 of the total weight.

2/8 of 20 ounces is (2/8) * 20 = 5 ounces.

Now, we subtract the weight of the two pieces from the total weight of the cake: 20 - 5 = 15 ounces.

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces.

Total oranges = 34 (Sitti's oranges) + 22 (Juris's oranges) = 56 oranges

Now, we divide the total oranges by the total number of people: 
56 / 8 = 7

So, everyone will get 7 oranges."
"To determine the cost per serving, we first need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients. Antoine is doubling the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of the onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00. He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which cost 2 * $2.00 = $4.00. The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Since the soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes Bernadette to drive to the theater. Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to drive to the theater, the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to drive to the theater, she should leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 21 minutes before Wayne to get to the theater first.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we can convert 3 yards to feet by multiplying 3 by 3.

3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now that we have the length in feet, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width. The formula for the area of a rectangle is length * width. We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, so we can solve for the width.

Area = length * width
360 = 9 * width
width = 360 / 9
width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is 2 * (length + width). 

Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of Billie's room is 98 feet.

"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads each one bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Elizabeth has 1*20 + 2*20 = 40 beads.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Margareth has 3*20 + 4*20 = 100 beads.

Now, to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has: 100 - 40 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the change in temperature due to the oven and the window.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour, and it is on for 3 hours. So, the total temperature increase due to the oven is 5 * 3 = 15 degrees.

Next, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the window. The window cools down the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes it is open, and it is open for 30 minutes. So, the total temperature decrease due to the window is 2 * (30/10) = 6 degrees.

Now, we need to add the temperature increase due to the oven and subtract the temperature decrease due to the window to find the final temperature. 

Final temperature = Initial temperature + Temperature increase due to oven - Temperature decrease due to window
= 40 + 15 - 6
= 49 degrees.

The final temperature of the house is 49 degrees."
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the time it took James to complete each segment of the triathlon.

Jon's swim time is 40 minutes, and James finishes the swim 10% faster. To find James' swim time, we need to calculate 10% of 40 minutes and subtract it from 40 minutes.

10% of 40 minutes is 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes. 

So, James' swim time is 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

Jon's bike ride time is 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes. James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike, so James' bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Jon's run time is 50 minutes. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time must be 10 minutes more than Jon's total time.

Jon's total time is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes. 

James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Since James' run time is the only unknown, we can subtract James' swim and bike times from his total time to find his run time.

James' run time is 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes.

The final answer is 59."
"To solve this problem, we need to first convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. 

1 hour = 60 minutes
1.25 hours = 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes

Now, we know that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. 
Movie B = Movie C + 5 minutes
Movie B = 75 + 5 = 80 minutes

Since Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, 
Movie A = Movie B / 4
Movie A = 80 / 4
Movie A = 20 minutes

The final answer is 20."
"To determine the total amount of hay the horse eats, we first need to calculate the distance the horse runs. Since the horse runs at 32 miles per hour and runs for 30 minutes, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

30 minutes is 0.5 hours. 

Now, we can calculate the distance the horse runs: 
Distance = Speed * Time 
Distance = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours 
Distance = 16 miles 

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs, and a bail of hay costs $3, the total cost of the hay is:
Total cost = Distance * Cost per mile 
Total cost = 16 miles * $3/mile 
Total cost = $48 

Michael has six 5-dollar bills, so he has a total of:
Total money = 6 * $5 
Total money = $30 

Now, we can calculate the change Michael has after buying the hay:
Change = Total money - Total cost 
Change = $30 - $48 
Change = -$18 

Since Michael can't have a negative amount of money, this means he doesn't have enough money to buy the hay. He is short $18.

The final answer is: $-18"
"To determine the total number of eggs Rozanne has, we need to calculate the number of eggs in the cases and the loose eggs. 

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs would be 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass requires 5 eggs, so we divide the total number of eggs by 5 to find out how many glasses Rozanne can fill. 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays Rozanne can put out. 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

Marcy scored 10 points, but this doesn't affect Joey's score. 

Now, we need to compare Joey's score with Marcy's score. Marcy has 225 points. To find out by how many points Joey is winning, we subtract his score from Marcy's score: 225 - 188 = 37 points.

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's calculate the revenue from selling 17 sneakers at $20 each: 
17 * $20 = $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling the remaining sneakers at $25 each. There were 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left.
31 * $25 = $775

The total revenue is the sum of these two amounts: 
$340 + $775 = $1115

The total cost was $576. To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
$1115 - $576 = $539

The salesman's profit is $539."
"To find the total number of colors Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of colors in each type of packet and then add them together.

Six packets had eight colors each, so the total number of colors from these packets is 6 * 8 = 48.

Four packets had sixteen colors each, so the total number of colors from these packets is 4 * 16 = 64.

Now, we add the total number of colors from both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112.

Therefore, Beatrice bought 112 colors of crayons in all.

"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given information. 

Let's denote the regular price of a popcorn as P and the regular price of a soda as S. 

We know that the super ticket costs $20, and it includes a popcorn and a soda. We also know that the soda costs $3. 

The total cost of the super ticket is the sum of the cost of the ticket and the cost of the popcorn and soda. Since the super ticket costs $20, and the soda costs $3, the cost of the popcorn must be $20 - $3 = $17.

Now, let's consider the alternative option: buying a movie ticket for $12 and a popcorn and a soda at regular price. The total cost of this option is $12 + P + S.

We are given that the person saved $2 by choosing the super ticket over the alternative option. This means that the cost of the super ticket is $2 less than the cost of the alternative option. 

We can set up the equation: 20 = 12 + P + S - 2. Simplifying the equation, we get 20 = 10 + P + S.

Now, we know that the cost of the popcorn is $17. We can substitute this value into the equation: 20 = 10 + 17 + S. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 20 = 27 + S. Subtracting 27 from both sides, we get S = -7. However, this is not possible since the price cannot be negative. 

Let's re-examine the equation 20 = 10 + P + S. We can subtract 10 from both sides to get 10 = P + S. 

We know that the cost of the popcorn is $17. We can substitute this value into the equation: 10 = 17 + S. 

Subtracting 17 from both sides, we get S = -7. However, this is not possible since the price cannot be negative. 

Let's re-examine the equation 20 = 12 + P + S. We can subtract 12 from both sides to get 8 = P + S. 

We know that the cost of the soda is $3. We can substitute this value into the equation: 8 = P + 3. 

Subtracting 3 from both sides, we get P = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, we first need to find the original cost of filling one balloon. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as x. Since the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, we can set up the equation 20x = 900. 

Dividing both sides by 20, we get x = 45. This means the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Now, two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. So, the new cost of filling one balloon is 45 + 20 = 65.

To find the total cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we multiply the new cost of filling one balloon by 170: 65 * 170 = 11,100.

The final answer is: 11,100"
"To find the average speed of the car, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

The car drives at 60 mph for 2 hours, so the distance covered in this part of the trip is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles

The car then drives at 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance covered in this part of the trip is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 mph * 1 hour = 30 miles

The total distance covered is the sum of these two distances:
Total Distance = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

The total time taken is the sum of the times taken for each part of the trip:
Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

The average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires and rubies separately and then add them together.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires, each worth $800. So, the total value of the sapphires is 8 * $800 = $6400.

She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. The value of the 3 sapphires she gave up is 3 * $800 = $2400. 

The value of the 2 rubies she received is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

Now, we need to find the total value of all her jewels. We already know the value of the sapphires she gave up ($2400) and the value of the rubies she received ($2400). To find the value of the remaining sapphires, we subtract the value of the sapphires she gave up from the initial value of the sapphires: $6400 - $2400 = $4000.

Now, we add the value of the remaining sapphires ($4000) to the value of the rubies ($2400) to get the total value of all her jewels: $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"
"To find the total number of apples eaten by Marin and Nancy in 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of apples each of them eats in 30 days and then add them together.

Marin eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, he eats 4 * 30 = 120 apples.

Nancy also eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, she eats 4 * 30 = 120 apples.

The total number of apples eaten by both Marin and Nancy in 30 days is 120 + 120 = 240 apples.

"To determine the total cost of the potting soil, we need to calculate the volume of soil required for the raised beds. 

The volume of each raised bed is calculated as width * length * height = 2 * 8 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is 10 * 32 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags required is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

The cost of each bag is $12, so the total cost of the potting soil is 160 * $12 = $1920.

"To find the total number of cards, we first need to determine the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of green cards = Number of red cards + (60% of the number of red cards)
= 15 + (0.6 * 15)
= 15 + 9
= 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards. So, the number of yellow cards is:

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards:

Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. Then, 20 minutes later, her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. This means that 50 / 2 = 25 fairies joined from the east.

So, the total number of fairies now is 50 (initial fairies) + 25 (new fairies) = 75 fairies.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. To find the remaining number of fairies, we subtract 30 from the total number of fairies: 75 - 30 = 45.

Therefore, there are 45 fairies remaining.

"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add the number of puppies from both Jennifer's and Brandon's dogs. 

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. 
Total puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Now, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. 
Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. 
Total puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we divide the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

The final answer is 35."
"To determine the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of each item and then add them together.

The total weight of the sugar cubes is 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

The total weight of the carrots is 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

The total weight of the hay is 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

The total weight of the oats is 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

The total weight of all the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4400 pounds.

To find out how many trips the farmer needs to make, we divide the total weight of the feed by the capacity of the truck: 4400 / 2250 = 1.96.

Since the farmer cannot make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To determine Grayson's earnings from recycling, we need to calculate the total amount of money she earns from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately and then add them together.

For aluminum cans: 3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week
For plastic bottles: 5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly earnings by 4:
Aluminum cans: 6 cents/week * 4 weeks = 24 cents
Plastic bottles: 15 cents/week * 4 weeks = 60 cents

Total earnings from recycling in a month: 24 cents + 60 cents = 84 cents

The final answer is: 84"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate Toni's plants as follows:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + 60% of Frederick's plants
Toni's plants = 10 + 0.6 * 10
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find out how many plants Shondra has. Since Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, we can calculate Shondra's plants as follows:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much Ali has now, we need to calculate half of Leila's money and add it to Ali's initial amount.

"To find the total number of cards Miss Maria has, we need to calculate the number of basketball cards and baseball cards separately.

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, so the total number of basketball cards is 6 * 25 = 150.

She has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200.

The total number of cards Miss Maria has is 150 (basketball) + 200 (baseball) = 350 cards.

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is 350 - 50 = 300 cards.

Since each student gets 10 cards, the number of students can be found by dividing the total number of cards given to students by 10. 

Number of students = 300 / 10 = 30.

The final answer is 30."
"To find out how much Becky paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples she bought and subtract the discount she received. 

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each, so the total cost is 20 * 0.45 = $9. 

She received a $1 discount, so the amount she paid is 9 - 1 = $8.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the apples Kelly bought. Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each, so the total cost is 20 * 0.50 = $10.

Kelly received a 10 percent discount, which is 0.10 * 10 = $1. So, the amount she paid is 10 - 1 = $9.

To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we subtract the amount Becky paid from the amount Kelly paid: 9 - 8 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry, we need to calculate the number of each item per room and then multiply by 80.

Each room has:
- 2 sheets
- 1 comforter
- Twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases
- Twice as many towels as pillow cases, so 2 * 4 = 8 towels

Now, let's calculate the total number of pieces per room:
2 sheets + 1 comforter + 4 pillow cases + 8 towels = 15 pieces per room

To find the total number of pieces in 80 rooms, we multiply the number of pieces per room by 80:
15 pieces/room * 80 rooms = 1200 pieces

The final answer is: 1200"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of shoes Fireman Frank has before getting rid of any shoes on Saturday. 

He starts with 200 shoes. On Monday, he gets 5 pairs, which is 5 * 2 = 10 shoes. On Wednesday, he gains 15 pairs, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes. On Friday, he gains 30 pairs, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.

Now, we add the shoes he already had to the shoes he gained: 200 + 10 + 30 + 60 = 300 shoes.

However, on Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. So, we subtract 180 from the total: 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

Therefore, Fireman Frank will have 120 shoes on Sunday.

"To determine the number of pans Mary should bake, we first need to calculate the total number of cupcakes she can decorate with her sprinkles. Since she has 6 jars of sprinkles, and each jar can decorate 8 cupcakes, the total number of cupcakes she can decorate is 6 * 8 = 48 cupcakes.

Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we can divide the total number of cupcakes by 12 to find out how many pans she needs to bake. 48 / 12 = 4.

Therefore, Mary should bake 4 pans of cupcakes to use up all of her sprinkles.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, there are 30 students, each with 10 pencils. So, the total number of pencils is 30 * 10 = 300.

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils are used. This means 1/5 * 300 = 60 pencils are used. The remaining pencils are 300 - 60 = 240.

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils are left. This means 1/3 * 240 = 80 pencils are left.

Therefore, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is 80.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the given conditions. Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be represented as:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. First, we subtract 2 from both sides:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies in total.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we first need to calculate the total length of the remoras. Since there are 2 remoras, each 6 inches long, the total length of the remoras is 2 * 6 = 12 inches.

Now, we need to convert the length of the remoras to feet to match the unit of the shark's length. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 12 inches is equal to 1 foot. 

The total length of the remoras is 1 foot. The shark's length is 10 feet. 

To find the percentage, we divide the length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100: (1 / 10) * 100 = 10%.

The combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length."
"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home. Let's denote the total number of students as 'x'. 

Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, the number of students with a desktop computer is (3/4)x. 

We are also given that 20 students do not have desktop computers. This means the number of students without a desktop computer is (1/4)x, as the remaining one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer.

We can set up an equation based on this information: (1/4)x = 20.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to get x = 80.

Therefore, there are 80 students at that grade level.

"To determine the daily walking time, we need to divide the total walking time by the number of days available. 

First, we need to convert the total walking time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 240 minutes is equal to 240 / 60 = 4 hours.

Now, we can divide the total walking time in hours by the number of days available. Jason has three weeks, which is 3 * 7 = 21 days. 

So, the daily walking time is 4 hours / 21 days = 0.19048 hours per day.

To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60. 0.19048 * 60 = 11.4296 minutes per day.

The final answer is: 11.43"
"To find out how many books each child received, we need to first determine the total number of books Sarah bought. 

Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can divide the total amount spent by the cost of each book to find the total number of books:

300 / 15 = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by 4 to find out how many each child received:

20 / 4 = 5

Therefore, each child received 5 books.

"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. We start by adding the number of kids allergic to dairy (9) and the number allergic to peanuts (6), which gives us 15. However, we have double-counted the 3 kids allergic to both, so we need to subtract them once to avoid double-counting.

15 - 3 = 12

Now, we subtract the total number of kids allergic to something (12) from the total number of kids in the class (32) to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything.

32 - 12 = 20

The number of kids in Gina's class who aren't allergic to anything is 20.

The number of tour guides is not relevant to the total number of people going on the tour.

The total number of people going on the tour is 600."
"To calculate the total cost of the trip, we need to first find the cost of the hotel for 3 days. 

The normal price of the hotel per day is $1500. Since the hotel is 20% more expensive for a busy weekend, we need to calculate 20% of the normal price and add it to the normal price.

20% of $1500 is 0.2 * $1500 = $300. 

The price of the hotel for 3 days is $1500 + $300 = $1800. 

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the trip by adding the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel. 

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 * 2 = $10,000. 

The total cost of the trip is $10,000 + $1800 = $11,800.

Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint. Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, so Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so Jasper has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

Therefore, Jasper has a total of 2 (blue) + 9 (yellow) = 11 tubes of paint.

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to determine the weight of the 2010 penny. Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight as follows:

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * Weight of 1959 penny
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48 grains
Weight of 2010 penny = 36 grains

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their individual weights:

Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny
Combined weight = 48 grains + 36 grains
Combined weight = 84 grains

"To find out how many songs Luri can add to his player, we need to calculate 3 times the number of songs Gabriel has. 

Since Gabriel has 20 songs, Luri has 3 * 20 = 60 songs. 

Now, to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add, we subtract the number of songs Luri has from the maximum capacity of the player. 

100 (maximum capacity) - 60 (Luri's songs) = 40

So, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can add to his.

"To calculate the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to first find out how many oranges he ate. Since he ate 2/5 of the oranges, we can multiply the total number of oranges by this fraction.

Total oranges = 60
Fraction of oranges eaten = 2/5

Number of oranges eaten = Total oranges * Fraction of oranges eaten
= 60 * 2/5
= 60 * 0.4

Since her handbag cost $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes, we subtract $20 from $240 to find the cost of her handbag.

$240 - $20 = $220.

The cost of Jillian's handbag is $220."
"To find the total hours James runs per week, we need to calculate the total miles he runs in a week and then divide that by his speed.

Total miles run per week = miles run per day * days run per week
Total miles run per week = 12 miles/day * 5 days/week
Total miles run per week = 60 miles/week

Now, we can find the total hours he runs per week by dividing the total miles by his speed:
Total hours run per week = Total miles run per week / speed
Total hours run per week = 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour
Total hours run per week = 6 hours/week

"To determine the total amount of oats needed, we first need to calculate the daily consumption of oats by the horses. Since each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal and is fed twice a day, the total daily consumption per horse is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds.

With four horses, the total daily consumption is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

Since Uncle Ben wants to feed his horses for five days, the total amount of oats needed is 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how many bags of oats are required to meet this demand. Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats. To find the number of bags needed, we divide the total amount of oats required (200 pounds) by the weight of oats in each bag (50 pounds).

200 / 50 = 4

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

"To find the cost of each individual razor after the discount, we need to first calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors. 

Since each pack costs $4.00 and they are on sale for buy one get one free, the total cost for 2 packs would be $4.00 for the first pack and $0 for the second pack. 

So, the total cost for 2 packs is $4.00. 

Now, we need to subtract the $2.00 coupon from the total cost. 

$4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00

Since the coupon is in dollars, we need to convert it to cents. 

$2.00 = 200 cents

Now, we subtract the coupon amount from the total cost in cents. 

200 cents - 400 cents (since 2 packs cost 400 cents) = -200 cents

However, since we can't have negative cents, we need to reconsider the calculation. 

The correct calculation is: 

The first pack costs $4.00, and the second pack is free. The total cost for 2 packs is $4.00. 

Now, we subtract the $2.00 coupon from the total cost. 

$4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00

Since the coupon is in dollars, we need to convert it to cents. 

$2.00 = 200 cents

Now, we subtract the coupon amount from the total cost in cents. 

200 cents - 400 cents (since 2 packs cost 400 cents) = -200 cents

However, since we can't have negative cents, we need to reconsider the calculation. 

The correct calculation is: 

The first pack costs $4.00, and the second pack is free. The total cost for 2 packs is $4.00. 

Now, we subtract the $2.00 coupon from the total cost. 

$4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00

Since the coupon is in dollars, we need to convert it to cents. 

$2.00 = 200 cents

Now, we subtract the coupon amount from the total cost in cents. 

200 cents - 400 cents (since 2 packs cost 400 cents) = 200 cents

Since the second pack is free, we only pay for 1 pack. 

The cost of each individual razor is 200 cents.

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) plus $5x (food cost). The cost of the second venue is $25x (per guest charge). 

We want to find when these two costs are equal, so we set them equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of insects each person found. Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found B/2 insects. 

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found B/2 + 7 insects.

We also know that the total number of insects collected is 43. Therefore, the sum of the insects found by each person is equal to 43. 

We can set up the equation: B + B/2 + B/2 + 7 = 43.

Combine like terms: 2B/2 + 7 = 43.

Simplify: B + 7 = 43.

Subtract 7 from both sides: B = 36.

Now that we know Bodhi found 36 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: B/2 = 36/2 = 18.

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found: B/2 + 7 = 36/2 + 7 = 18 + 7 = 25.

"To find the length of the couch, we need to first find the width of the rug. Since the chair is 3 feet wide and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, the rug's width is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. Adding 2 feet to this gives us 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

Therefore, the couch is 18 feet long.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total amount Suzie paid for the grape and green apple gum. 

She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum and half as much for a pack of green apple gum, which is $2 / 2 = $1. 

The total amount she paid for these two packs is $2 + $1 = $3. 

Since she paid $7 in total, the amount she paid for the strawberry gum is $7 - $3 = $4. 

Since she bought two packs of strawberry gum, the cost of each pack is $4 / 2 = $2.

"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks, Frederick should buy the 2 x 8 lumber, as it provides more sticks per dollar. 

He can buy 4 2 x 8 pieces of lumber for $24, as 4 * $6 = $24. This will give him 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks.

The final answer is 1600."
"To determine the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs, we need to calculate the total number of pairs of snowshoes required. Since each dog has four legs and each pair of snowshoes covers two legs, we can divide the total number of legs by 2 to find the number of pairs needed.

6 dogs * 4 legs per dog / 2 legs per pair = 12 pairs of snowshoes

Now, we can multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair to find the total cost.

12 pairs * $12.00 per pair = $144.00

The total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs is $144.00."
"To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week without the pass and then subtract the cost of the pass.

Janet takes two bus trips per day, five days a week. So, the total number of bus trips per week is 2 trips/day * 5 days/week = 10 trips/week.

The cost of each bus trip is $2.20. Therefore, the total cost of her bus trips for a week is 10 trips/week * $2.20/trip = $22.

The weekly bus pass costs $20. To find out how much she would save, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of her bus trips: $22 - $20 = $2.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the number of cows and sheep in each location.

The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, and the farm has 30 cows. So, the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, and the zoo has 20 sheep. So, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals in the farm and zoo combined. The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, for a total of 30 + 10 = 40 animals. The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, for a total of 60 + 20 = 80 animals.

The combined total is 40 (farm) + 80 (zoo) = 120 animals.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the quantities of onions and potatoes bought by Sophia and Rose. 

Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can set up the following equations:

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as x and the number of potatoes Sophia bought as y.

We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, which is 4 times the number Sophia bought. So, we can write the equations:

Onions: 4x = 12
Potatoes: 4y = 4

Solving these equations, we get:

x = 12 / 4 = 3
y = 4 / 4 = 1

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

Total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought = 3 + 1 = 4

"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs, we first need to calculate the total number of days he has to lose the weight. 

From December 31st to July 19th, there are 183 days. 

Since Andy needs to lose 30 lbs, and each pound requires a 3500 calorie deficit, the total calorie deficit needed is 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days: 105,000 calories / 183 days ≈ 576 calories per day.

Therefore, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of approximately 576 calories to reach his goal."

"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on clothes: 
20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount:
$500 - $100 = $400

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on CDs:
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount:
$400 - $100 = $300

"To find the cost of the house, we need to determine the cost of the lot first. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, we can set up an equation: 

Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Then, the cost of the house is 3x. 

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write the equation: x + 3x = 120,000.

Combine like terms: 4x = 120,000.

Divide both sides by 4: x = 30,000.

Now that we know the cost of the lot is $30,000, we can find the cost of the house by multiplying the cost of the lot by 3: 3 * 30,000 = 90,000.

Therefore, the house costs $90,000.

"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total amount of money Ali has. 

Ali has 4 $10 bills, which is 4 * $10 = $40. He also has 6 $20 bills, which is 6 * $20 = $120. The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives his sister half of the total money, which is $160 / 2 = $80. So, he is left with $160 - $80 = $80.

Then, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. 3/5 of $80 is (3/5) * $80 = $48. 

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.
Kathy picks twice as many quarts per hour as Bobby, so Kathy picks 5 * 2 = 10 quarts per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, so Ricky picks 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, we add the individual rates together: 6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29 quarts per hour.

Since a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins, and she has 27 cups of raisins, we can divide 27 by 3/4 to find the total number of batches.

To divide 27 by 3/4, we can multiply 27 by the reciprocal of 3/4, which is 4/3. 

27 * (4/3) = 36

So, Heather can make 36 batches of oatmeal cookies with the raisins."
"To calculate the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we first need to calculate her current weekly consumption and the new weekly consumption.

Current weekly consumption: 
12 kilowatts per hour * 7 hours = 84 kilowatt-hours per week
New weekly consumption: 
12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour
14 kilowatts per hour * 7 hours = 98 kilowatt-hours per week

Now, we calculate the weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device:
Weekly electric bill before: 84 kilowatt-hours per week * $1.50 per kilowatt-hour = $126 per week
Weekly electric bill after: 98 kilowatt-hours per week * $1.50 per kilowatt-hour = $147 per week

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $147 - $126 = $21.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the rate at which one person paints the house. Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can calculate the rate as follows:

Rate = 1/2 house / 5 days = 1/10 house per day

Now, if 5 people are working together, their combined rate would be 5 times the individual rate:

Combined rate = 5 * (1/10) = 1/2 house per day

Since they need to paint a whole house, we can calculate the time required as follows:

Time = 1 house / (1/2 house per day) = 2 days

To convert this to hours, we multiply the number of days by 24:

Time (in hours) = 2 days * 24 hours/day = 48 hours

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of chairs Ophelia has. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, and Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can set up an equation to find the number of chairs Ophelia has.

Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as 'x'. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna has 3x chairs. We know that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so the number of chairs Ophelia has is 2 more than the number of sofas she has. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x = 20 + 2

Solving for x, we get:

x = 22

Now that we know Ophelia has 22 chairs, we can find the number of chairs Jenna has:

Jenna's chairs = 3x
Jenna's chairs = 3 * 22
Jenna's chairs = 66

Now, we can find the total number of sofas and chairs they have:

Total number of sofas = 20
Total number of chairs = 22 + 66 = 88

Total number of sofas and chairs = 20 + 88 = 108

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks, we need to calculate the total hours for the weeks he worked out 4 hours, the weeks he worked out 5 hours, and the week he worked out 6 hours.

For the weeks he worked out 4 hours, there are 6 weeks (since he didn't work out 4 hours for 2 weeks). 
6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 24 hours

For the week he worked out 5 hours, there is 1 week.
1 week * 5 hours/week = 5 hours

For the week he worked out 6 hours, there is 1 week.
1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jame's current age be x. 

In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5) + 5 = x + 10 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. 

So, we can set up the equation: 
x + 10 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:
x + 10 = 2x + 5

Subtracting x from both sides:
10 = x + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides:
5 = x

Now that we know Jame's current age is 5, we can find the age of his cousin. 

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 + 8 = 13 years old.

The age difference between Jame and his cousin is 13 - 5 = 8 years.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of seashells brought back by the boys. We know that each boy brought 60 shells, and there are 20 boys in total. 

Total shells brought by boys = 60 shells/boy * 20 boys = 1200 shells

Since the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys, we can represent the number of shells brought by the girls as 1200 + 4 * 60.

Number of shells brought by girls = 1200 + 4 * 60
= 1200 + 240
= 1440

Now, we know that the girls were divided into two equal groups, so there are 10 girls in each group. To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by the number of girls.

Seashells brought by each girl = 1440 shells / 10 girls

"To determine how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete the 72 vlogs per month, we need to calculate the total number of vlogs she has already made. 

She made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. 

Total vlogs made so far = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs

Since she needs to make 72 vlogs per month and has already made 54, we subtract the number of vlogs she has made from the target to find out how many more she needs to make.

The eldest boy adds $5 to his share, making his total $6 + $5 = $11. The next day, he adds another $10, making his total $11 + $10 = $21.

He then spends $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

After saving some more, he triples the amount he had left, which is $13. So, the amount he saved is $13 * 3 = $39.

To find the total amount he has now, we need to add the amount he had left after spending $8 to the amount he saved. So, $13 + $39 = $52.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total amount Elvis needs to save in the second half of the month. Since there are 30 days in April, the first half of the month is 15 days, and the second half is also 15 days.

Let's denote the amount Elvis saves in the first half as x. Then, he saves 2x in the second half. 

The total amount Elvis needs to save is $1125. We can set up the equation:

Combine like terms:

3x = 1125

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 375

So, Elvis saves $375 in the first half of the month. 

Now, we know that Elvis saves 2x in the second half, which is 2 * 375 = 750.

To find out how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half, we divide the amount he saves in the second half by the number of days in the second half:

750 / 15 = 50

Therefore, Elvis needs to save $50 each day in the second half of the month.

In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families being notified.

In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 27 * 3 = 81 new families being notified.

So, the total number of families notified in the fourth round is 81.

"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to reverse the weight loss process. Since he lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, we can calculate his initial weight by adding the total weight lost to his final weight.

Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + (10 pounds/month * 3 months)
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of toys Jonathan needs to have in order to have a play set five times larger than James's play set. 

Since James's play set has 80 toys, a set five times larger would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys. 

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than this, so he needs 400 + 2 = 402 toys.

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 402 - 2 = 400 toys.

"To calculate the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we need to first find the total cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The cost of five notebooks is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.
The cost of two pens is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.
The cost of one calculator is $12.
The cost of one geometry set is $10.

The total cost of all the items is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

Now, we need to apply the 10% discount. To do this, we need to find 10% of the total cost, which is 0.10 * $30 = $3.

The total cost after the discount is $30 - $3 = $27.

Therefore, Daniel has to spend $27 on all the items he wants to buy.

"To calculate the total cost of the items Carly ordered, we need to multiply the quantity of each item by its price and then add them together.

Five hamburgers at $4 each will be 5 x $4 = $20.
Ten packs of potato fries at $0.30 each will be 10 x $0.30 = $3.
Five cans of fruit drinks at $2 each will be 5 x $2 = $10.

Now, let's add the costs together: $20 + $3 + $10 = $33.

Carly pays with a $50 bill, so we need to subtract the total cost from the $50 bill to find the change: $50 - $33 = $17.

The change Carly gets back is $17."
"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down her commission into two parts: the commission for sales up to $1000 and the additional commission for sales over $1000.

For sales up to $1000, her commission is 30% of $1000, which is 0.3 * $1000 = $300.

For sales over $1000, her commission is 10% of the amount above $1000, which is 10% of ($2500 - $1000) = 0.1 * $1500 = $150.

Therefore, Antonella's total earnings are $300 + $150 = $450.

"To determine the total number of water bottles Bill needs, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles he already has. Since he has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each, the total number of bottles he has is 2 * 24 = 48.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he needs for his guests. He wants 2 bottles for each of his 70 guests, so the total number of bottles needed is 70 * 2 = 140.

To find out how many additional bottles Bill needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles needed: 140 - 48 = 92.

Therefore, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water for his party.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Ray to swim 3 miles on both a cold day and a hot day.

On a cold day, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. Therefore, to swim 3 miles, it would take him 3 x 16 = 48 minutes.

On a hot day, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. Since he swims a mile in 16 minutes on a cold day, he swims a mile in 2 + (2 x 16) = 2 + 32 = 34 minutes on a hot day. 

To swim 3 miles on a hot day, it would take him 3 x 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time between a hot day and a cold day is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

The final answer is: 54"
"To determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly earnings and then divide the target savings by his weekly earnings.

John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day for 4 days a week. So, his weekly earnings are:

$2/hour * 5 hours/day * 4 days/week = $40/week

To find out how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we can divide the target savings by his weekly earnings:

$80 / $40/week = 2 weeks

Therefore, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80.

"To determine the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub, we need to first find out how much the foot-long fish sub costs. Since the six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs thrice as much as the foot-long fish sub, we can multiply the cost of the foot-long fish sub by 3.

Cost of the foot-long fish sub = $40
Cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub = 3 * $40 = $120

Now, we need to subtract the cost of the foot-long fish sub from the total cost to find the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub.

Total cost = $40 (foot-long fish sub) + $120 (six-inch cold-cut combo sub) = $160

However, the question asks for the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub, not the total cost. Therefore, the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is $120.

The cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is $120."
"To find the total number of holes in the bag, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the number of holes in the buttons with four holes.

There are 7 buttons with two holes, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 * 2 = 14.

The rest of the buttons have four holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total, the number of buttons with four holes is 21 - 7 = 14.

The total number of holes in the buttons with four holes is 14 * 4 = 56.

Now, we add the total number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the buttons with four holes: 14 + 56 = 70.

Therefore, there are 70 holes in all the buttons in the bag.

"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to first determine the size of Zack's locker, which is half of Timothy's locker. 

Since Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches, Zack's locker is 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches.

Now, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To find the size of Peter's locker, we multiply the size of Zack's locker by 1/4.

12 * 1/4 = 12 / 4 = 3 cubic inches.

Therefore, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much coffee Juan currently drinks. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, and Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups, we can calculate Juan's current coffee intake as follows:

Octavia's daily coffee intake = 1/2 * daily recommended cups
Juan's daily coffee intake = 10 * Octavia's daily coffee intake
Juan's daily coffee intake = 10 * (1/2 * daily recommended cups)
Juan's daily coffee intake = 5 * daily recommended cups

Since Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups, we can calculate the reduction in his daily coffee intake as follows:

Reduction in Juan's daily coffee intake = Juan's current daily coffee intake - daily recommended cups
Reduction in Juan's daily coffee intake = 5 * daily recommended cups - 4 cups
Reduction in Juan's daily coffee intake = 1 cup

"To find the total number of rodents, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, so the total number of hamsters is 3 x 10 = 30.

There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so the total number of guinea pigs is 3 x 5 = 15.

Now, we add the total number of hamsters and guinea pigs together: 30 + 15 = 45.

Therefore, the pet shop had 45 rodents in total.

"To find the average weight of the three friends, we need to first find their individual weights. 

Mark weighs 150 pounds. 
Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. 
Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we can find the average weight by adding their weights and dividing by 3: 
(150 + 130 + 260) / 3 = 540 / 3 = 180.

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the initial angle of the pyramid and the rate at which the sun is moving. 

The initial angle of the pyramid is 32 degrees. Since the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, the initial angle between the sun and the ground is 32 degrees. 

The sun moves 5 degrees an hour. In 10 hours, it will move 5 * 10 = 50 degrees. 

Since the sun is moving upward, we need to subtract this angle from the initial angle to find the final angle between the sun and the ground. 

Final angle = Initial angle - Angle moved = 32 - 50 = -18 degrees.

However, since the angle cannot be negative, we need to consider the supplementary angle. 

Final angle = 180 - 18 = 162 degrees.

The final answer is 162."
"To determine the total cost of the candles, we need to first find out how many candles James needs. 

Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Since the older son is 12 years old, James needs 12 candles for him and 8 candles for the younger son. 

The total number of candles needed is 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we can divide the total number of candles by 5 to find out how many packs James needs to buy.

20 candles / 5 candles per pack = 4 packs

Since each pack costs $3, the total cost of the candles is 4 packs * $3 per pack = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she spent reading in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, she spent a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes reading in the first week.

Now, we know that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she read in the first week, we can divide the total minutes she spent reading (105) by 1.5 minutes per page, and then multiply by 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. 

105 / 1.5 = 70
70 * 2 = 140 pages

So, Judy read 140 pages in the first week.

To find out how many pages she read in two weeks, we can add the pages she read in the first week (140) to the pages she read in the second week (100). 

140 + 100 = 240 pages

Therefore, Judy read 240 pages in two weeks.

"To find out how many sandwiches are left, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor.

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which is 1/3 of 12. 
1/3 of 12 is 4 sandwiches.

Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which is 1/4 of 12. 
1/4 of 12 is 3 sandwiches.

The total number of sandwiches eaten is 4 + 3 = 7.

To find the number of sandwiches left, we subtract the total number eaten from the initial number of sandwiches. 
12 - 7 = 5

There are 5 sandwiches left."
"To solve this problem, let's denote Shiloh's current age as S and his nephew's current age as N. We are given that Shiloh is 44 years old today, so S = 44.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be S + 7, and his nephew's age will be N + 7. According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This can be expressed as:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44 into the equation:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

10 = N

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, the tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.

For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as she had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since she received $1.00 for each of the previous three teeth, she received half of that amount for each of the last two teeth, which is $0.50 per tooth. For two teeth, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna. 

We know that Richie scored 80 goals, and he scored 20 more goals than Mark. So, we can set up an equation to find the number of goals scored by Mark: 

Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as 'x'. 
Since Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can write the equation as: 
80 = x + 20 
Solving for x, we get: 
x = 80 - 20 
x = 60 

Now that we know Mark scored 60 goals, we can find the number of goals scored by Anna. 
We know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. 
So, we can set up another equation: 
80 = y + 45 
Solving for y, we get: 
y = 80 - 45 
y = 35 

Now that we know the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers. 
Total goals = Goals scored by Richie + Goals scored by Mark + Goals scored by Anna 
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35 
Total goals = 175 

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how much Mitchell made, we need to multiply the number of lemonades he sold by the price of each lemonade. 

Number of lemonades sold by Mitchell = 21
Price of each lemonade = $4

Total amount Mitchell made = Number of lemonades sold * Price of each lemonade
Total amount Mitchell made = 21 * $4
Total amount Mitchell made = $84

Now, we need to find out how much more Mitchell made than Liam. 

Liam's earnings = $63
Mitchell's earnings = $84

Difference in earnings = Mitchell's earnings - Liam's earnings
Difference in earnings = $84 - $63
Difference in earnings = $21

Therefore, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam that weekend."
"To determine the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we first need to calculate how much he spent on wooden action figures and how much he has left.

Peter spent $5 each day for 3 days (Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday) on wooden action figures. So, he spent 3 * $5 = $15 on wooden action figures.

He started with $70 and spent $15, so he has $70 - $15 = $55 left.

For the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. Since he has $55 left, he can buy $55 / $2 = 27.5 plastic action figures. However, since you can't buy half a figure, we'll round down to 27 plastic action figures.

In total, Peter will have 3 wooden action figures and 27 plastic action figures by the end of the week.

Total action figures = 3 + 27 = 30"
"To calculate the total cost of the kitten, we need to add the cost of spaying, the cost of the vaccines, and the cost of the broken vases.

The cost of spaying is $200.
The cost of the vaccines is 3 * $20 = $60.
The cost of the broken vases is 4 * $12 = $48.

Now, let's add these costs together: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

The total cost of the kitten so far is $308."
"To determine the total number of roses Ford needs to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses he supplies per week. 

Ford supplies 40 roses to the first flower shop, 15 roses to the second flower shop, and 30 roses to the third flower shop. 

Total roses supplied per week = 40 + 15 + 30 = 85 roses.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the total roses supplied per week by 4 to get the total roses supplied per month.

Total roses supplied per month = 85 * 4 = 340 roses.

Now, we need to find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month. 

To do this, we need to know the total number of roses the flower shops order in a month. 

The first flower shop orders 20 roses per week, the second flower shop orders 15 roses per week, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. 

Total roses ordered per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Total roses ordered per month = 65 * 4 = 260 roses.

Now, we subtract the total roses supplied per month from the total roses ordered per month to find out how many roses Ford lacks.

Roses lacking = Total roses ordered per month - Total roses supplied per month
= 260 - 340
= -80

However, since we cannot have a negative number of roses, we need to re-evaluate the problem. 

Let's re-examine the problem. We know that Ford supplies 340 roses per month, but the flower shops order 260 roses per month. This means that Ford has more roses than the flower shops need. 

Therefore, Ford does not lack any roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To determine the amount of money remaining in Katina's account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes from her account over that period. Since she removes $100 every month, we can multiply the monthly withdrawal by the number of months in 2 years.

There are 12 months in a year, so there are 12 * 2 = 24 months in 2 years. 

The total amount removed from the account is $100 * 24 = $2400.

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the account: $3000 - $2400 = $600.

Therefore, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her account.

Total cost = $30.00 + $30.00
Total cost = $60.00

Total revenue = Number of sandwiches sold * Price per sandwich
Total revenue = 10 * $7.00
Total revenue = $70.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $60.00
Net profit = $10.00

The net profit of the food truck is $10.00."
"To determine how many muffin crayons Kate can make, we need to calculate the total number of crayons she has. Since she has 3 boxes of 64 crayons, the total number of crayons is 3 * 64 = 192.

Since each muffin requires 8 crayons, the number of muffins Kate can make is 192 / 8 = 24.

To find out how much money Kate can make, we multiply the number of muffins by the selling price of each muffin: 24 * $1.50 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to calculate the total area of the room, then the total cost of the carpet, the cost of the padding, and the cost of the installation.

The area of the room is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 square feet * $12 per square foot = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 square feet * $2 per square foot = $432.

The cost of the installation is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of the installation is 216 square feet * $34 per square foot = $7344.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the carpet, the cost of the padding, and the cost of the installation: $2592 + $432 + $7344 = $9608.

Therefore, it will cost Michael $9608 to replace the carpet.

"To find the correct temperature, we need to determine the percentage by which the oven is off. 

First, we find the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature: 468 - 450 = 18 degrees.

Next, we divide the difference by the set temperature to find the percentage: (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Now, we need to find the correct temperature by adding the percentage to the set temperature: 520 + (520 * 0.04) = 520 + 20.8 = 540.8.

So, Maggie should set her oven to 540.8 degrees.

"To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, we can convert this to minutes by multiplying 60 by 1 and adding 30, which equals 90 minutes.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. We can convert this to minutes by multiplying 60 by 2 and adding 5, which equals 125 minutes.

Now, we add the time of the first movie (90 minutes) to the time of the second movie (125 minutes) to get the total time: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. Since she bought twice as many dishes as cups, she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups brought by Judy and her friend is 12 + 40 = 52 cups.

The total number of dishes brought by Judy and her friend is 24 + 44 = 68 dishes.

The total number of utensils (cups + dishes) brought by the two is 52 + 68 = 120.

"To determine the cost of each pair of contacts, we first need to calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts. 

Since each box is $100.00 and there's a 10% discount, the discounted price of one box is:
$100.00 * (1 - 0.10) = $90.00

The total cost of 2 boxes is:
$90.00 * 2 = $180.00

Since 90 single-use contacts last 45 days, we can calculate the number of days one pair of contacts will last:
90 contacts / 2 = 45 days per pair

Now, to find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the number of pairs:
$180.00 / 2 = $90.00 per pair

The final answer is: $90."
"To determine how much each person earned, we need to calculate their individual hours worked and multiply it by the hourly wage.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. Her earnings would be 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. His total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours. His earnings would be 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

"To determine the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories she burns from both activities.

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour, so the total calories burned from aerobics is 2 * 500 = 1000 calories.

She also spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour, so the total calories burned from running is 1 * 600 = 600 calories.

The total calories burned is the sum of calories burned from aerobics and running, which is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we can divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times she needs to drink 100 ml of water.

1600 / 200 = 8

So, she needs to drink 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml of water."

We are also given that the jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans. This can be expressed as: R = 0.99B.

Additionally, the jar contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as: G = 1.01B.

Substituting the expressions for R and G into the first equation, we get: B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500.

Combine like terms: 3B = 4500.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 1500.

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans: R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485.

Finally, we can find the number of green jelly beans: G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1509.

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans: 1509 - 1485 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to first find the third measurement. 

Jared's initial speed is 47 WPM. He increases it by 5 words to get 52 WPM. To find the next increase, we subtract the initial speed from the second speed: 52 - 47 = 5. 

Now, we add this increase to the second speed to get the third speed: 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

The three measurements are 47, 52, and 57. To find the average, we add these numbers together and divide by 3: (47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52.

The average of the three measurements is 52."
"To find the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks, we need to calculate the weight gained or lost in each scenario.

If Martin eats Cheerios every day, he loses 1.25 pounds/week. Over 5 weeks, he will lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

If Martin eats donuts every day, he gains 1.75 pounds/week. Over 5 weeks, he will gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

"To determine the total number of people attending the event, we need to calculate the number of people invited by Alex and the number of additional guests they will bring.

Alex initially invites 100 people. Each of these people invites 2 friends, so the total number of additional guests is 100 * 2 = 200.

Then, Alex invites 10 of her friends, and 8 of them bring their spouses. This adds 10 + 8 = 18 more people to the total.

Now, we add the initial 100 people, the 200 additional guests, and the 18 additional friends and spouses: 100 + 200 + 18 = 318.

Therefore, Alex will need 318 seats for the event.

"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to calculate the weights of the other dogs first.

The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"To determine the total cost of the boots on eBay, we need to calculate the shipping cost first. Since the shipping cost on eBay is twice as much as on Amazon, and the shipping cost on Amazon is $4, the shipping cost on eBay would be $4 * 2 = $8.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the boots on eBay by adding the cost of the boots and the shipping cost: $13 (boots) + $8 (shipping) = $21.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we subtract the cost of the boots on Amazon from the total cost on eBay: $21 (eBay) - $16 (Amazon) = $5.

The boots are $5 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the point at which the beanstalk's height exceeds Mark's window height. 

The initial height of the beanstalk is 4 feet. Since it doubles every day, we can calculate its height on each subsequent day:

Day 1: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 2: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 3: 16 * 2 = 32 feet
Day 4: 32 * 2 = 64 feet

Since 64 feet is greater than 20 feet (Mark's window height), the beanstalk will be taller than Mark's window on the 4th day.

The final answer is: 4"
"To determine the amount of protein John gets per week, we need to first calculate the amount of protein he gets per day. 

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day, and each cup of mushrooms contains 3 grams of protein, we can calculate the daily protein intake as follows:

200 grams (mushrooms per day) * 3 grams (protein per cup) = 600 grams of protein per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to get the weekly protein intake:

600 grams (protein per day) * 7 days (per week) = 4200 grams of protein per week

The final answer is: 4200"
"To solve this problem, let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. 

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation: x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides, we get: 0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get: 10 = x

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 10 + 3 = 13

"To determine how many hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. 

The base price of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. Adding the extra cost of the porcelain crown for one of the implants, the total cost becomes $4000 + $500 = $4500. 

Since George has already put down a deposit of $600, the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Now, we can calculate the number of hours George needs to work to earn $3900 at $15 per hour. 

Number of hours = Total amount / Hourly wage
= $3900 / $15
= 260 hours

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Let's denote the smallest angle as 'x'. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, its measure is 2x. 

The third angle is three times the smallest angle, so its measure is 3x.

We can now set up an equation to represent the sum of the angles: x + 2x + 3x = 180.

Combine like terms: 6x = 180.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 30.

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. The angle that is twice the smallest angle is 2x = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees.

The largest angle is three times the smallest angle, so its measure is 3x = 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

Therefore, the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

He has 8 quarters, which is 8 * 25 = 200 cents. 
He has 6 dimes, which is 6 * 10 = 60 cents. 
He has 14 nickels, which is 14 * 5 = 70 cents. 
He has 15 pennies, which is 15 * 1 = 15 cents.

Adding these amounts together, we get 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents.

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money Colby has by the cost of a gumball to find out how many he can buy: 345 / 5 = 69.

Therefore, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"To determine the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and then add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

The total number of legs in the store is 48."
"To find the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds. 

50% of 8 pounds = 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of games Steve buys each year and add the 5 games he receives as a gift.

In the first year, Steve buys 1 game per month, which is 12 games. He also receives 5 games as a gift, so he has 12 + 5 = 17 games.

In the second year, Steve buys 2 games per month, which is 24 games. He also receives 5 games as a gift, so he has 24 + 5 = 29 games.

In the third year, Steve buys 4 games per month, which is 48 games. He also receives 5 games as a gift, so he has 48 + 5 = 53 games.

Now, we need to add the total number of games Steve has at the end of each year to find the total number of games he has after 3 years. 

17 (end of year 1) + 29 (end of year 2) + 53 (end of year 3) = 99

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the rate at which the plane is traveling. We can do this by dividing the distance traveled (1200 miles) by the time taken (3 hours).

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now that we know the rate, we can use it to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it would take the plane 5 additional hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many pounds of chocolates each person makes in an hour. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so in 1 hour, he makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds as Ruiz in an hour, so she makes (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds in an hour.

Now, we need to calculate how many pounds of chocolates they make together in 12 hours. 

Ruiz makes 60 pounds in 1 hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds.

Marissa makes 45 pounds in 1 hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

On Monday, Howard spent $8.

On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, so he spent 2 * $8 = $16.

On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, so he spent 4 * $16 = $64.

The total amount of money he spent is $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

He originally had $100, so the amount of money he has left is $100 - $88 = $12.

"To find the total amount of money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the earnings from the first four hours and the next two hours separately and then add them together.

For the first four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup. So, the total cups sold in four hours is 15 * 4 = 60 cups. The total earnings from the first four hours is 60 * $0.50 = $30.

For the next two hours, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.60 per cup. So, the total cups sold in two hours is 10 * 2 = 20 cups. The total earnings from the next two hours is 20 * $0.60 = $12.

Now, we add the earnings from the first four hours and the next two hours to get the total earnings. Total earnings = $30 + $12 = $42.

"To determine the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to calculate the total number of rotations the tire will undergo in a year. 

First, we calculate the total number of rotations per year. Since Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, and there are 12 months in a year, the total number of miles driven per year is 400 * 12 = 4800 miles.

Since the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, the total number of rotations per year is 4800 / 2 = 2400 rotations.

Now, we divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo (10,440,000) by the number of rotations per year (2400) to find the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced: 10,440,000 / 2400 = 4325 years.

"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of washings Jackie can get from 1 pump. Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings.

Now, we can find the cost of each pump by dividing the total cost of the shampoo by the number of washings it can provide. 

Cost of shampoo = $24.00
Number of washings per pump = 60

Cost per pump = $24.00 / 60 = $0.40

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100.

Cost per pump (in cents) = $0.40 * 100 = 40 cents

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how much Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then subtract that from his initial $50.

First, we calculate the discount on the shirt: 30% of $25 is 0.3 * $25 = $7.50. The discounted price of the shirt is $25 - $7.50 = $17.50.

Next, we add the discounted price of the shirt to the price of the shorts: $17.50 + $35 = $52.50.

Since sales tax is included, we need to calculate the sales tax on the total cost of the items. The sales tax rate is not explicitly stated, but it's common for sales tax to be around 8% in the United States. So, the sales tax on the total cost is 0.08 * $52.50 = $4.20.

Now, we add the sales tax to the total cost: $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70.

Finally, we subtract the total cost from Joe's initial $50: $50 - $56.70 = -$6.70. Since Joe can't spend a negative amount, this means he doesn't have enough money to buy the outfit.

However, if we assume that Joe can only spend up to $50, we can recalculate the total cost without sales tax: $17.50 + $35 = $52.50. Since the total cost exceeds $50, Joe won't be able to afford the outfit.

In this case, Joe won't have any money left after the purchase.

"To determine the amount of butter needed, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants Juan wants to make in a week. Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for 7 days, we can multiply the number of croissants per day by the number of days.

4 dozen croissants per day * 7 days = 28 dozen croissants

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can convert the total number of croissants to pounds of butter needed.

28 dozen croissants * 1/4 pound per dozen = 28 * 1/4 = 7 pounds

Therefore, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two phases: the initial 5 months and the subsequent 5 months.

For the first 5 months, John received $100,000 per month. So, the total cost for the first 5 months is:

$100,000 * 5 = $500,000

For the next 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the funding for the second month is $100,000 * 1.5, for the third month it's $100,000 * 1.5 * 1.5, and so on.

The funding for the second month is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000
The funding for the third month is $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000
The funding for the fourth month is $225,000 * 1.5 = $337,500
The funding for the fifth month is $337,500 * 1.5 = $506,250

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for the remaining 5 months. We can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series:

Total cost = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where a is the first term ($150,000), r is the common ratio (1.5), and n is the number of terms (5).

Total cost = $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^5) / (1 - 1.5)
Total cost = $150,000 * (1 - 7.59375) / (-0.5)
Total cost = $150,000 * (-6.59375) / (-0.5)
Total cost = $150,000 * 13.1875
Total cost = $1,976,250

Now, we add the cost of the first 5 months and the cost of the remaining 5 months:

Total cost = $500,000 + $1,976,250
Total cost = $2,476,250

The total cost of John's research is $2,476,250."
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to calculate the ounces of meat each player consumed and then add them together.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak, which is a type of meat. 

The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so the total ounces of meat consumed by the second player is 8 ounces.

The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player consumed 16 ounces of meat.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Now, let's add up the ounces of meat consumed by the first three players: 6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces.

Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

"To determine the number of days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to calculate the total amount of meat he sells in a day and then divide the total weight of the bull by that amount.

Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour he works, and he works 10 hours a day. So, the total amount of meat he sells in a day is 15kg/hour * 10 hours = 150kg/day.

Now, we divide the total weight of the bull (750kg) by the amount of meat Prince sells in a day (150kg) to find out how many days it will take him to sell the meat: 750kg / 150kg/day = 5 days.

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

There are 4 rows of seats, and each row has 18 seats. So, the total number of seats is 4 * 18 = 72.

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators. One-fourth of 72 is 72 / 4 = 18. So, 18 seats were occupied by administrators.

The remaining seats are 72 - 18 = 54.

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents. One-third of 54 is 54 / 3 = 18. So, 18 seats were occupied by parents.

"To calculate the total number of functioning street lights, we first need to determine the total number of street lights at all intersections. Since each intersection has 4 street lights and there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is 4 * 4 = 16.

However, 20 street lights are not functioning. To find the number of functioning street lights, we subtract the number of non-functioning lights from the total number of lights. 

So, the total number of functioning street lights is 16 - 20 = -4. Since we cannot have a negative number of functioning lights, this indicates an error in the initial calculation. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. If each intersection has 4 street lights and there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights should be 4 * 4 = 16. But we are told that 20 street lights are not working, which is more than the total number of lights. This is a logical contradiction.

Given the information, it seems there might be an error in the problem statement. However, assuming the problem is asking for the number of functioning lights given that 20 are not working, we can proceed with the calculation.

The correct calculation is 16 - 20 = -4. However, since we cannot have a negative number of functioning lights, we should reconsider the problem statement.

If we assume the problem is asking for the number of functioning lights out of the total number of lights that are supposed to be there, we can calculate it as follows:

"To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to subtract the number of times each DVD has been played from its maximum capacity.

The first DVD has been played 356 times, so it has 1000 - 356 = 644 times left.
The second DVD has been played 135 times, so it has 1000 - 135 = 865 times left.

To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played, we add the remaining times of both DVDs: 644 + 865 = 1509.

The total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is 1509."
"To calculate the total cost of the physical therapy, we need to first calculate the total number of hours John attended therapy sessions. 

Since John attended twice a week for 6 weeks, the total number of sessions is 2 * 6 = 12 sessions. 

Each session lasted 2 hours, so the total number of hours is 12 * 2 = 24 hours.

The cost per hour is $125, so the total cost is 24 * 125 = $3000.

The final answer is: $3000"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, let's calculate the number of pieces of gum Jim chews at school. Since he chews 1 piece for every 2 hours, and the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

Next, we add the gum he chews on the way home from school and after dinner. This adds 2 more pieces to his total.

Now, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of gum Jim has at the beginning of the day. Since he starts with a 20 pack of gum, he has 20 pieces.

Now, let's add up all the pieces of gum Jim chews throughout the day: 4 (at school) + 2 (on the way home) + 1 (after dinner) = 7 pieces.

Now, we subtract the total number of pieces of gum Jim chews from the initial number of pieces he has: 20 - 7 = 13.

Finally, we need to account for the gum he gives to his sister. He gives her half of the remaining gum, so we divide 13 by 2: 13 / 2 = 6.5. Since we can't have half a piece of gum, we'll round down to 6 pieces.

Jim has 6 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

"To find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we need to calculate the total amount spent by each coach.

The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs for $3 each, so the total amount spent is 9 * 3 = $27.

The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs for $14 each, so the total amount spent is 8 * 14 = $112.

To find the difference, we subtract the amount spent by the baseball coach from the amount spent by the basketball coach: 112 - 27 = $85.

The basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"To find the number of bloomed flowers, we need to calculate 4/5 of the total number of flowers. 

First, we find the total number of flowers: 10 rows * 20 flowers per row = 200 flowers.

Then, we multiply the total number of flowers by 4/5: 200 flowers * 4/5 = 160 flowers.

Therefore, 160 flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb per second to Mb per second. 

Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can divide her speed by 1000 to get her speed in Mb per second: 
20 kb/second / 1000 = 0.02 Mb/second

Now, we need to convert her speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour. 
Multiply her speed in Mb per second by 3600 to get her speed in Mb per hour: 
0.02 Mb/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 72 Mb/hour

"To calculate the total number of cars towed, we need to break it down into two parts: the number of cars towed on the first three days and the number of cars towed on the remaining days.

On the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed on these days is 10 * 3 = 30.

On the remaining days (4 days), the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed on these days is 6 * 4 = 24.

Now, we add the total number of cars towed on both sets of days: 30 + 24 = 54.

The total number of cars towed that week is 54."
"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to calculate the difference between the required height (4 feet) and his current height (40 inches). 

First, we need to convert 4 feet into inches, as both measurements are in inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 4 feet is equal to 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we subtract Adam's current height from the required height: 48 - 40 = 8 inches.

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we divide the difference by his annual growth rate: 8 / 2 = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To determine James' earnings, we need to calculate the profit first. 

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars, so they paid 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500 per car. 

The profit per car is the selling price minus the cost, which is $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

James also received a 10% commission on the profits, which is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James' total earnings are $175,000 + $17,500 = $192,500.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know that 25% of the riders can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet. Since there are 100 riders, we can calculate the number of riders who can stay upright as follows:

25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders

We also know that 60% of these riders are women. To find the number of women who can stay upright, we can calculate:

60% of 25 = 0.6 * 25 = 15 women

Since the remaining riders are men, we can find the number of men by subtracting the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

25 - 15 = 10 men

Therefore, 10 men can stay upright on the wave.

"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to first find the prices of the gold and silver jewels.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can find the price of the gold jewel. Since the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate it as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

Now, we know that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold. So, we can find the price of the silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we have the prices of all three jewels: diamond ($2000), gold ($1600), and silver ($1200). To find the total price, we add the prices of all three jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond + Price of gold + Price of silver
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The total price for all three jewels is $4800."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller parts. 

Let's denote the number of snowflake stamps as S, the number of truck stamps as T, and the number of rose stamps as R.

We know that Max bought 16 snowflake stamps, so S = 16.

We also know that he bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so T = S + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19.

Lastly, we know that he bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so R = T - 9 = 19 - 9 = 10.

To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to add the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps together: S + T + R = 16 + 19 + 10 = 45.

The final answer is 45."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is approaching Bob. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed to get the relative speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph
Relative speed = -15 mph

However, since speed cannot be negative, we need to consider the absolute value of the relative speed. The negative sign indicates that Tom is moving in the opposite direction.

Relative speed = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Relative speed

Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the number of fish caught by each person. 

We know that Naomi caught 17 fish. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught by subtracting 6 from 17. 

Darren's catch = Naomi's catch - 6
Darren's catch = 17 - 6
Darren's catch = 11

We also know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. To find Tommy's catch, we add 3 to Darren's catch.

Tommy's catch = Darren's catch + 3
Tommy's catch = 11 + 3
Tommy's catch = 14

The final answer is: 14"
"To determine the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the total cost of the classes and then subtract the cost per class that his parents are willing to pay.

The total cost of the classes is $60. Since there are 10 classes, the cost per class is $60 / 10 = $6.

Manny's parents are willing to pay $10 per class. To find out how many classes they will allow him to miss, we need to subtract the cost per class they are willing to pay from the cost per class. 

$6 (cost per class) - $10 (cost per class they are willing to pay) = -$4 (this is negative, so it's not possible to miss classes for free)

However, we can calculate the number of classes they are willing to pay for. 

$10 (cost per class they are willing to pay) / $6 (cost per class) = 1.67 (approximately)

Since Manny can't miss a fraction of a class, we round down to 1 class. 

So, Manny can miss 1 class before his parents won't sign him up again.

"To determine the total weekly production, we first need to find out how many customers each person processes in a day. 

Since Jewel processes 50 customers per day, and Julie processes twice as fast, Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day.

The total number of customers processed by both in a day is 50 (Jewel) + 100 (Julie) = 150 customers.

Since they work all 7 days of the week, the total weekly production is 150 * 7 = 1050 customers.

Total time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Total time = 72 * 3
Total time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price of the truck.

The base price of the truck is $30,000. 

The king cab upgrade is $7,500. 

Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, we add the cost of each feature to the base price of the truck: 
$30,000 + $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $43,000.

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,000."
"To calculate Tim's new monthly salary, we need to first calculate the raise amount. 

The raise amount is 5% of his current salary, which is $20000. 
5% of $20000 = 0.05 * $20000 = $1000.

His new monthly salary will be $20000 + $1000 = $21000.

The bonus is half a month's salary, which is $20000 / 2 = $10000.

So, his new monthly salary is $21000 + $10000 = $31000.

To find his yearly salary, we multiply his new monthly salary by 12. 
$31000 * 12 = $372000.

The final answer is: $372000."

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay. Bill can dig half as fast through clay, so his rate is 4 / 2 = 2 feet/hour. He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour
Time = 4 hours

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the clay to get the total time.

Total Time = Time through soil + Time through clay
Total Time = 6 hours + 4 hours
Total Time = 10 hours

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the total number of cupcakes Howie should buy, we need to calculate the total number of people, including himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates. 

The total number of people is 1 (Howie) + 1 (his teacher) + 25 (his classmates) = 27.

Since Howie wants to get one of each type of cupcake for everyone, he needs 2 cupcakes for each person. 

The total number of cupcakes needed is 2 * 27 = 54.

Therefore, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know that the number of likes after three weeks is 70 times the initial number of likes. Since the initial number of likes was 2000, the number of likes after three weeks is 70 * 2000 = 140000.

Then, we are told that 20000 more likes were received recently. To find the total number of likes now, we need to add the new likes to the likes after three weeks. 

Total likes now = likes after three weeks + new likes
Total likes now = 140000 + 20000
Total likes now = 160000

The final answer is: 160000"
"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on both days.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got $2 off. So, the total cost for her was 20 * $20 - $2 = $398.

On the next day, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each, but the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. The total cost for her was 20 * $30 * (1 - 0.10) = 20 * $30 * 0.90 = $540.

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $540 - $398 = $142.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find the total sales of green hats in the first month. Since the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, we can set up the equation:

Red hat sales = 1/2 * Green hat sales
400 = 1/2 * Green hat sales
Green hat sales = 400 * 2
Green hat sales = 800

Now, we know that in the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. The total sales of the first month is the sum of the sales of red and green hats, which is 400 + 800 = 1200. 

So, the sales in the second month are 3/4 of 1200, which is (3/4) * 1200 = 900.

The total amount she made in two months is the sum of the sales of both months, which is 1200 + 900 = 2100.

The final answer is: 2100"
"To determine the total cost, we need to calculate the number of paid hours and then multiply it by the cost per hour.

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so the number of paid hours is 4 - 1 = 3 hours.

The cost of the first paid hour is $15. Each subsequent hour is twice the cost, so the cost of the next two hours is 2 * $15 = $30 each.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the first hour and the cost of the next two hours: $15 + $30 + $30 = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to subtract the amount she has in her bank account from her expected wage. 

First, let's calculate the difference between her expected wage and the amount in her bank account: 
$300 (expected wage) - $420 (current bank balance) = -$120

Since the result is negative, it means that more money was taken out of her account than she should have received. To find out how much was withheld, we need to subtract the current balance from the expected wage. 

$300 (expected wage) - $420 (current bank balance) = $120

So, $120 was withheld from Sally's wage."
"To determine the number of eggs Lori needs, we first need to calculate the total number of deviled egg halves required for her guests. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves and she is inviting 16 guests, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is 3 * 16 = 48.

Since each egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2 to find the total number of eggs required. 48 / 2 = 24.

Since a dozen is equal to 12, we can convert 24 to dozens by dividing by 12. 24 / 12 = 2.

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs for her party.

24"
"To determine how many pages Shiela has left to write, we need to calculate the total number of pages she has already written and subtract that from the total number of pages required.

Since Shiela has written 1/3 of the paper, we can calculate the number of pages she has written as follows:

Total pages = 15
Pages written = 1/3 * 15 = 5

Now, we subtract the number of pages written from the total number of pages:

Pages left = Total pages - Pages written
Pages left = 15 - 5
Pages left = 10

Therefore, Shiela has 10 pages left to write.

"To calculate the total cost of owning and maintaining the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly rent, and the monthly fuel costs.

The initial cost of the plane is $150,000.

The monthly rent is $5000, and the fuel costs twice as much, so the fuel costs $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month.

The total monthly cost is the sum of the rent and fuel costs: $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.

To find the total cost for the first year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12: $15,000 * 12 = $180,000.

Adding the initial cost of the plane, the total cost for the first year is $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice. Since it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

We also know that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time for pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Therefore, the cooking time for beans is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

To find the total cooking time, we need to add up the cooking times for all three items: rice (30 minutes), pork (50 minutes), and beans (40 minutes). 

Total cooking time = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture: 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. 

Cost of almonds: 1/2 * $10 = $5
Cost of walnuts: 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the first mixture: $5 + $5 = $10

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture: 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

Cost of almonds: 1/5 * $10 = $2
Cost of walnuts: 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the second mixture: $2 + $5 = $7

Now, let's find the difference between the two costs: $10 - $7 = $3

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the number of legs and heads for each type of animal. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head, while geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. We can set up the following equations based on the given information:

1. Total number of animal heads: s + g = 20
2. Total number of animal legs: 4s + 2g = 70

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of 's' and 'g'. 

First, let's multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of 'g' the same in both equations:

2(s + g) = 2(20)
2s + 2g = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate 'g':

(4s + 2g) - (2s + 2g) = 70 - 40
2s = 30

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

s = 15

Therefore, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"To determine the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the coffee. Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, that's 7 pounds. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

First, we find 20% of $5: 20% of $5 = 0.20 * $5 = $1. 

Now, we add this to the cost of the normal brand: $5 + $1 = $6 per pound. 

Since Roger buys 7 pounds, the total cost of the coffee is 7 * $6 = $42. 

Adding the cost of the donut, the total cost is $42 + $2 = $44."
"To determine the cost of the apple pie, we need to subtract the total cost of the items Gus purchased from the total amount he spent. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought: 
2 bags of chips for $2.00 each = 2 * $2.00 = $4.00
Adding the cost of the bucket of fried chicken ($8.00) and the bottle of soda ($1.00), we get: $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Now, subtracting the total cost of the items from the total amount spent: $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

Therefore, the apple pie cost $7.00.

"To determine the total number of recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total class time and then divide it by the time required to learn a new recipe.

Total class time = Number of classes * Class duration
Total class time = 4 classes/week * 2 hours/class
Total class time = 8 hours/week

Since the class meets for 6 weeks, we multiply the total class time by the number of weeks:
Total class time = 8 hours/week * 6 weeks
Total class time = 48 hours

Now, we divide the total class time by the time required to learn a new recipe:
Number of recipes = Total class time / Time to learn a new recipe
Number of recipes = 48 hours / 1.5 hours/recipe
Number of recipes = 32

"To find the number of math teachers, we need to calculate 100% - 60% of the total number of teachers, which is 150. 

100% - 60% = 40%

Now, we multiply 40% by the total number of teachers to find the number of math teachers: 
40% of 150 = 0.4 * 150 = 60

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, we multiply the number of math teachers by 6 to find the total time they spend sleeping in one day:
60 * 6 = 360

The total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money each person has. 

We know that Aurelia has $120. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows: 
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * Aurelia's money
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * $120
Kassidy's money = $90

We also know that Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's money as follows:
Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + $60
Rayna's money = $90 + $60
Rayna's money = $150

Now, we have the total amount of money each person has: 
Aurelia's money = $120
Kassidy's money = $90
Rayna's money = $150

If they decide to add together their money and share equally among them, we need to find the total amount of money they have together. 
Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
Total money = $120 + $90 + $150
Total money = $360

Since they want to share the money equally, we divide the total money by 3. 
Equal share = Total money / 3
Equal share = $360 / 3
Equal share = $120

So, each person would have $120 if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of days that were either good or bad. We know that Christina had 12 good days and 8 bad days, so the number of neutral days is 30 - (12 + 8) = 10.

We also know that the first eight days were good, the second eight days were bad, and the third eight days were neutral. This means that the first 24 days accounted for 8 good days and 8 bad days, leaving 10 neutral days.

Now, we are told that the next three days were good, neutral, and good. This means that the total number of good days is 12 + 3 = 15.

However, we also know that the first 8 days were good, and the next 3 days were good, so the total number of good days in the last 11 days is 8 + 3 = 11.

21 = 2x + 3

Now, we need to isolate 'x'. To do this, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

21 - 3 = 2x + 3 - 3

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, James had 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he had 1 toy per dog. 

When he left, there were 8 more dogs in the shelter, making a total of 4 + 8 = 12 dogs. Since each dog needs one toy, James needed 12 toys.

However, when he returned, there were twice as many dogs as when he left, which means there were 2 * 12 = 24 dogs. Since he already had 12 toys, he needed 24 - 12 = 12 more toys.

After buying the additional toys, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needed those toys. This means he had 12 + 12 = 24 toys, but 3 were not needed. 

So, the total number of toys James needs is 24 - 3 = 21.

68 = Max's cookies - 5
Max's cookies = 68 + 5
Max's cookies = 73

We also know that Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. So, we can set up another equation to find the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has:

Max's cookies = Cookie Monster's cookies + 12
73 = Cookie Monster's cookies + 12
Cookie Monster's cookies = 73 - 12
Cookie Monster's cookies = 61

Now that we know the number of cookies each person has, we can add them together to find the total number of cookies:

"To find the original length of the dress, we need to reverse the process of the changes made to it. 

Let's denote the original length of the dress as x. 

The dress was extended by 50% of its original length, so the new length is x + 0.5x = 1.5x. 

Then, 20cm was added to the bottom of the dress. 

The final length of the dress is given as 140cm. 

So, we can set up the equation: 1.5x + 20 = 140.

Now, we can solve for x: 
1.5x = 140 - 20 
1.5x = 120 
x = 120 / 1.5 
x = 80 

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the age of the younger twin as 'x'. Since there is one set of twins, the age of the older twin would be 'x + 7'. 

We also know that there is a set of triplets, so we'll denote the age of the youngest triplet as 'y'. The ages of the other two triplets would be 'y + 1' and 'y + 2'. 

The combined ages of the twins and the triplets are given as 44. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 7) + y + (y + 1) + (y + 2) = 44

Combine like terms:

2x + 3y + 10 = 44

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x + 3y = 34

Now, we need to find integer values of x and y that satisfy this equation. Since x is the age of a twin and y is the age of a triplet, both x and y should be non-negative integers.

Let's try different values of y to find a suitable solution. 

If y = 4, then 3y = 12, and 2x = 22. Solving for x, we get x = 11.

So, one of the twins is 11 years old.

So, Neil saves 240 + 96 = 336 coins per year.

Now, we need to find out how many coins they save in total in 10 years. 
Rong saves 240 * 10 = 2400 coins in 10 years.
Neil saves 336 * 10 = 3360 coins in 10 years.

Now, we add the total coins saved by both Rong and Neil in 10 years: 
2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

The final answer is: 5760"
"To determine how much John leaves with, we first need to calculate the total cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. 

The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so we need to find 60% of the total cost. Let's denote the total cost as 'x'. The equation for the heartworm check is 0.6x. 

Since the total cost is the sum of the cost of vaccines and the heartworm check, we can write the equation as: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40. 

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100.

So, the total cost is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60. 

The total cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check is $40 + $60 = $100. 

John brought $125, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25."
"To determine the price of the crate, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of fruit and then sum them up. 

First, we know that one banana costs twice as much as an apple, and one apple costs $0.5. Therefore, one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

Since one orange costs three times as much as a banana, one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each type of fruit in the crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is the sum of the costs of all the fruits: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

Therefore, the price for such a crate of fruit is $32."
"To determine the total area of the comforter, we need to find the total number of colored squares and then multiply it by the area of each square (1 square foot).

Let's start by finding the number of each color of squares:

- Red squares: 14
- Blue squares: 14 + 4 = 18
- Green squares: 18 + 6 = 24
- White squares: 24 - 12 = 12

Now, we add up the number of squares of each color: 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68

Since each square is 1 square foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

68"
"To determine the number of chairs Mia needs to get, we first need to find out how many regular chairs she has. Since the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:

Number of regular chairs = 5 * Number of high chairs
= 5 * 8
= 40

Now, we need to find the total number of chairs needed. There are 42 adults and 15 babies attending, so the total number of people is 42 + 15 = 57.

Since Mia already has 8 high chairs and 40 regular chairs, the total number of chairs she has is 8 + 40 = 48.

To find out how many more chairs she needs, we subtract the total number of chairs she has from the total number of people:

Number of chairs needed = Total number of people - Total number of chairs
= 57 - 48
= 9

Therefore, Mia needs 9 more chairs.

"To find the number of 8-point bucks, we need to calculate 20% of the total number of bucks. 

First, we find the number of bucks: 50 * 0.5 = 25 bucks.

Then, we calculate 20% of the bucks: 25 * 0.2 = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 eight-point bucks.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total points collected by each student. 

First, we know Adam has 50 points. Betty collected 30% more than Adam, so Betty has 50 + 0.3 * 50 = 65 points.

Since Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom, and Tom has 30 points less than Betty, we can express this as: 
Let's denote Tom's points as T. 
Then, Martha's points = 3T, and Betty's points = T + 30. 
Since Betty's points = 65, we can set up the equation: 
T + 30 = 65 
Solving for T, we get: 
T = 65 - 30 
T = 35 

Now that we know Tom's points, we can find Martha's points: 
Martha's points = 3T = 3 * 35 = 105 

Now, we have the points for all students: 
Adam = 50 
Betty = 65 
Tom = 35 
Martha = 105 

The total points collected by the class is the sum of their points: 
Total points = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 

Since the minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points, the class is missing 400 - 255 = 145 points."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

1. Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.
2. Each of her children has 3 children of their own, so there are 3 x 3 = 9 grandchildren.
3. Each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 babies of their own, so there are 9 x 3 = 27 great grand-babies.

Therefore, there will be 27 great grand-babies for Great Grandma Jones to kiss at the family reunion.

"To determine how much money Greta has left to spend, we need to calculate the amount she sets aside for retirement and her car payment, and then subtract that from her initial paycheck.

First, we calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account: 50% of $2400.00 is 0.5 * $2400.00 = $1200.00.

Next, we calculate the amount she uses for her car payment: 20% of $2400.00 is 0.2 * $2400.00 = $480.00.

Now, we subtract the total amount she sets aside from her initial paycheck: $1200.00 (retirement) + $480.00 (car payment) = $1680.00. 

$2400.00 (initial paycheck) - $1680.00 (retirement and car payment) = $720.00.

Greta has $720.00 left to spend.

"To find the number of pairs of pencils in the box, we first need to determine the total number of pencils in the box. Since there is space for 20 pencils and 4 are missing, the total number of pencils in the box is 20 - 4 = 16.

Since a pair consists of 2 pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by 2 to find the number of pairs. 

16 / 2 = 8

Therefore, there are 8 pairs of pencils in the box.

"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we first need to calculate the total number of fireworks set off in the city and then add the fireworks set off in her backyard.

The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks set off in the city is 15 * 20 = 300.

Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard, so the total number of fireworks set off in her backyard is 3 * 5 = 15.

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to calculate 40% of 300, which is 0.4 * 300 = 120.

Now, we add the fireworks Hannah can see from the city (120) to the fireworks set off in her backyard (15), which gives us a total of 120 + 15 = 135.

The final answer is: 135"
"To determine the total amount of money spent on snacks and drinks, we first need to calculate the total number of people and the total number of drinks and snacks.

Aiden and his 12 friends are initially 13 people. Then, they meet up with 7 more friends, making the total number of people 13 + 7 = 20.

Each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks. Since there are 20 people, we can calculate the total number of drinks and snacks as follows:

- Total number of drinks: 20 people * 2 drinks/person = 40 drinks
- Total number of snacks: 20 people * 3 snacks/person = 60 snacks

Since each drink and snack costs $2, the total cost of drinks and snacks can be calculated as follows:

- Total cost of drinks: 40 drinks * $2/drink = $80
- Total cost of snacks: 60 snacks * $2/snack = $120

The total amount of money spent on snacks and drinks is the sum of the cost of drinks and snacks: $80 + $120 = $200.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the weight capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

Now, we know that when Gary joins Gissela and Gordy, the three trucks combined can haul 11,600 pounds. We also know that Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds and Gordy's truck can haul 4,800 pounds. To find the weight capacity of Gary's truck, we subtract the combined weight capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total weight capacity of the three trucks.

So, the weight capacity of Gary's truck is 11,600 - (4,000 + 4,800) = 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many dumplings each male ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

We know there are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

We also know there are 6 females, and each female ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females must equal the total number of dumplings Larry cooked. Therefore, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is 32 (males) + 18 (females) = 50.

"To find out how much money Gerald had left, we first need to determine the total parts in the ratio, which is 3 + 2 = 5. 

Since Gerald's share is 3 parts, we can calculate his share of the money by multiplying his parts by the total amount of money: 3/5 * $100 = $60.

Gerald spent $10 on a book, so we subtract this amount from his share: $60 - $10 = $50.

The final answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the speed of the turtle. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can divide the cat's speed by 5 to find the turtle's speed.

The cat's speed is 15 feet/second. 
Turtle's speed = Cat's speed / 5
Turtle's speed = 15 / 5
Turtle's speed = 3 feet/second

Now that we know the turtle's speed, we can calculate the distance it can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 * 40
Distance = 120 feet

The turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we need to first determine the amount they still need to raise, which is the difference between their goal and the amount already raised. 

The amount they need to raise is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

Since they raise an equal amount in every hour, we can divide the amount they need to raise by the hourly rate to find the number of hours they need to fundraise. 

$4200 / $2100 per hour = 2 hours.

Therefore, the firefighters need to fundraise for 2 more hours to reach their goal.

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city, and then subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes.

The city uses 40% of the river's water. Since 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes, we can find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes by subtracting 80% from 40%.

First, we need to convert 40% to a decimal: 40% = 0.4

Then, we subtract 80% (or 0.8) from 0.4: 0.4 - 0.8 = -0.4

However, since we cannot have a negative percentage, we need to re-evaluate the problem. We know that 80% of the 40% is used for industrial purposes, so we need to find the percentage of the river's total water that corresponds to 40%.

Let's re-evaluate the problem: if 80% of the river's water is used for industrial purposes, and the city uses 40% of the river's water, we can set up a proportion to find the total percentage of the river's water used by the city.

Let x be the total percentage of the river's water used by the city. We know that 80% of x is equal to 40% of the river's total water.

0.8x = 0.4

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.8:

x = 0.4 / 0.8
x = 0.5

Now that we know the city uses 50% of the river's water, we can find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes by subtracting 50% from 100%:

100% - 50% = 50%

Therefore, the city uses 50% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the rate at which the factory makes each type of ice cream. 

The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours, so its rate is 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour.

The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours, so its rate is 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of ice cream made in 48 hours. 

For chocolate ice cream: 50 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
For vanilla ice cream: 12.5 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

The total amount of ice cream made in 48 hours is 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts.

"To calculate Marcus' total bill, we need to first calculate the total cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The total cost of the croissants is 5 x $3.00 = $15.00.
The total cost of the cinnamon rolls is 4 x $2.50 = $10.00.
The total cost of the mini quiches is 3 x $4.00 = $12.00.
The total cost of the blueberry muffins is 13 x $1.00 = $13.00.

The total cost of all the items is $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

Applying the 10% discount, we get 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00.

The total bill after the discount is $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00.

Since each scoop costs $1.50, and she gets 1 scoop free for every 2 scoops she buys, we can calculate the cost of 3 scoops as follows:

3 scoops = 2 scoops (cost) + 1 scoop (free)
Cost of 3 scoops = 2 * $1.50 = $3.00

Since Erin has $6.00, she can afford 3 scoops. 

She should buy 3 scoops of ice cream.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she would have eaten 3 * 14 = 42 pieces of candy.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, Ginger would have 100 - 56 = 44 pieces of candy, and Amy would have 100 - 42 = 58 pieces of candy.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

"To calculate the total calories in the omelet, we need to calculate the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham separately and then add them together.

The omelet contains 6 eggs, each weighing 2 oz. Since eggs are 75 calories per ounce, the total calories from the eggs would be 6 * 2 * 75 = 900 calories.

The omelet contains 2 oz of cheese, which is 120 calories per ounce, so the total calories from the cheese would be 2 * 120 = 240 calories.

The omelet also contains 2 oz of ham, which is 40 calories per ounce, so the total calories from the ham would be 2 * 40 = 80 calories.

"To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the potential damage it could cause to his car.

The potential damage to Ron's car is $450. 

The cost of fixing the pothole himself includes the cost of the asphalt (3 buckets * $25 = $75) and the fine he would have to pay to the city council ($120). 

So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $75 (asphalt) + $120 (fine) = $195.

By fixing the pothole himself, Ron saves $195 (total cost) - $450 (potential damage) = -$255. However, since we are calculating the savings, we should consider the negative value as a loss, not a savings. 

Therefore, Ron actually incurs a loss of $255 by fixing the pothole himself.

The total number of slices eaten by Bryce and two friends is 8. 

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 12 slices per pizza, they ate ¾ * 12 = 9 slices.

The total number of slices eaten is 8 + 9 = 17 slices.

120 / 15 = 8

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

"To determine the total number of smores needed, we first calculate the total number of smores required for the kids and adults separately. 

For the kids: 9 kids * 2 smores/kid = 18 smores
For the adults: 6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 6 smores

Total smores needed = 18 smores (kids) + 6 smores (adults) = 24 smores

Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, we divide the total number of smores needed by 8 to find the number of sleeves required: 24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need 3 boxes of graham crackers to meet the total demand."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the ages of Dora's father and mother. 

We know Dora's age is 15 years. Since Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age, we can calculate his age as follows:

Father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8
Father's age = 2 * 15 + 8
Father's age = 30

Since Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, we can calculate her age as follows:

Mother's age = Father's age - 4
Mother's age = 30 - 4
Mother's age = 26

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:

Total combined age = Dora's age + Father's age + Mother's age
Total combined age = 15 + 30 + 26
Total combined age = 71

"To find the total weight of Cindy's books, we need to calculate the weight of each book and add them together.

The math and science books weigh 2 pounds each, so together they weigh 2 + 2 = 4 pounds.

The French book weighs 4 pounds and the English book weighs 3 pounds.

The history book weighs twice as much as the English book, so it weighs 2 * 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of all the books together: 4 (math and science) + 4 (French) + 3 (English) + 6 (history) = 17 pounds.

Therefore, the total weight of Cindy's books is 17 pounds.

"To find the number of votes candidate C received, we first need to determine the number of votes candidate B received, as it is given that candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A.

Candidate A received 20% of the votes, which is 0.20 * 100 = 20 votes.

Since candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A, candidate B received 20 + (0.50 * 20) = 30 votes.

The total number of votes is 100, and the sum of votes received by candidate A and candidate B is 20 + 30 = 50 votes.

Therefore, the number of votes candidate C received is 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we can calculate Beck's initial number of apples as follows:

Beck's initial apples = Boris's apples - 23
Beck's initial apples = 100 - 23
Beck's initial apples = 77

Now, let's calculate the number of apples Beck has after Boris gives him 10 apples:

Beck's apples after giving 10 = Beck's initial apples + 10
Beck's apples after giving 10 = 77 + 10
Beck's apples after giving 10 = 87

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract Beck's apples after giving 10 from Boris's remaining apples:

Difference = Boris's remaining apples - Beck's apples after giving 10
Difference = 100 - 87
Difference = 13

"To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and subtract that from the initial 32 ounces.

For giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces per cube = 12 ounces
For medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces per cube = 14 ounces
For small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces per cube = 4 ounces

Total water used = 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces

Now, subtract the total water used from the initial amount: 32 - 30 = 2 ounces

The water Peter has left is 2 ounces."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of books Steven has. Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven and Clara has 20 books, we can set up the equation 2x = 20, where x represents the number of books Steven has. 

Solving for x, we get x = 20 / 2 = 10. 

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can determine the number of books Alice has. Since Alice has 6 more books than Steven, Alice has 10 + 6 = 16 books.

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has: 20 - 16 = 4.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find the cost of a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $5 and it's $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can calculate the cost of a half-gallon jar by subtracting $2 from the cost of a gallon jar.

Cost of a half-gallon jar = Cost of a gallon jar - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $3

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money Cecelia spent on 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

Cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 * $5
Cost of 10-gallon jars = $50

Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = $48

Total amount of money spent = Cost of 10-gallon jars + Cost of 16 half-gallon jars
Total amount of money spent = $50 + $48
Total amount of money spent = $98

The final answer is: $98"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of students who like to play music. Since the number that like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball, and 5 students like to play basketball, we can calculate the number of students who like to play music as follows:

Number of students who like to play music = 2 * Number of students who like to play basketball
= 2 * 5
= 10

Now, we know that the total number of students in the class is 50, and 10 like to bake and 5 like to play basketball. So, the number of students who like to play video games or play music can be found by subtracting the number of students who like to bake and play basketball from the total number of students:

Number of students who like to play video games or play music = Total number of students - Number of students who like to bake - Number of students who like to play basketball
= 50 - 10 - 5
= 35

Since the number of students who like to play video games and the number of students who like to play music are the same, we can divide the total number of students who like to play video games or play music by 2 to find the number of students who like to play video games:

Number of students who like to play video games = Number of students who like to play video games or play music / 2
= 35 / 2
= 17.5

However, since the number of students cannot be a fraction, we can round down to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we can also consider that the question might be asking for the number of students who like to play video games, not the number of students who like to play video games or play music. In that case, the correct answer would be 17.

The final answer is 17."
"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many birds were scared away by the stone. Since 1/3 of the original 12 birds were scared away, we can calculate this as follows:

1/3 of 12 = (1/3) * 12 = 4

So, 4 birds were scared away. 

Now, we need to find out how many birds are left in the backyard. We subtract the number of birds scared away from the original number:

12 - 4 = 8

Then, we add the 20 new birds that joined:

8 + 20 = 28

Therefore, there are 28 birds in the backyard now.

"To find the number of boys in each class, we first need to determine the total number of students in each class. Since there are two classes with the same number of students, we divide the total number of students by 2.

Total students = 80
Number of classes = 2
Students per class = Total students / Number of classes
Students per class = 80 / 2
Students per class = 40

Now, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of boys, we need to find 100% - 40% = 60% of the students.

Number of girls per class = 40% of 40
Number of girls per class = 0.4 * 40
Number of girls per class = 16

Now, we can find the number of boys in each class by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.

Number of boys per class = Students per class - Number of girls per class
Number of boys per class = 40 - 16
Number of boys per class = 24

"To calculate Mark's profit, we need to first calculate the total cost of the packs and the total value of the cards he received.

Total cost of packs: 3 packs * $1800 per pack = $5400

Total value of the cards: 
- The card worth $4000
- The card worth $1000
- 30 cards worth $50 each: 30 * $50 = $1500
Total value of the cards: $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500

Now, we subtract the total cost from the total value to find the profit:
Profit = Total value of the cards - Total cost of packs
Profit = $6500 - $5400
Profit = $1100

"To determine the cost of the first amusement park, we need to calculate the total cost for the adults and the children separately and then add them together. 

The cost for the adults at the first amusement park is 2 * $26 = $52. 
The cost for the children at the first amusement park is 2 * $12 = $24. 
The total cost for the first amusement park is $52 + $24 = $76.

To determine the cost of the second amusement park, we follow the same process. 
The cost for the adults at the second amusement park is 2 * $14 = $28. 
The cost for the children at the second amusement park is 2 * $10 = $20. 
The total cost for the second amusement park is $28 + $20 = $48.

To find out how much they will save by choosing the second amusement park over the first, we subtract the total cost of the second amusement park from the total cost of the first amusement park. 
$76 - $48 = $28.

Therefore, Jake's family will be able to save $28 by choosing the second amusement park over the first."
"To determine the weekly savings, we need to calculate the daily savings and then multiply it by 7.

The vendor used to buy 500 tomatoes a day at $.5 each, so the daily cost was 500 * $.5 = $250.

The daily savings is $250 - $200 = $50.

To find the weekly savings, we multiply the daily savings by 7: $50 * 7 = $350.

The final answer is: $350."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the number of marbles each person has. 

Since Sean has 56 marbles and he has half as many marbles as Cal, we can find the number of marbles Cal has by doubling Sean's marbles. 

Cal has 2 * 56 = 112 marbles.

Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, so Carl has 4 * 56 = 224 marbles.

To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add their marbles together: 224 + 112 = 336.

"To determine the number of groups needed, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of groups. However, the question states that 12 groups are already required, and we need to find out how many more groups are needed.

Since 54 students are to be separated into 12 groups, we can calculate the number of students per group by dividing 54 by 12. 

54 ÷ 12 = 4.5

Since we cannot have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to accommodate all the students. However, the question asks for the number of additional groups needed, not the total number of groups.

To find the number of additional groups needed, we can subtract the number of groups already required from the total number of groups needed. 

Total groups needed = 54 students / 4 students per group = 13.5
Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we round up to 14 groups.
Number of groups already required = 12
Number of additional groups needed = 14 - 12 = 2

"To determine the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends separately and then add them together.

In a 4-week month, there are 20 weekdays (4 weeks * 5 weekdays per week) and 8 weekend days (4 weeks * 2 weekend days per week). 

The number of chairs rented during weekdays in a 4-week month is 20 * 60 = 1200.

The number of chairs rented during weekends in a 4-week month is 8 * 100 = 800.

The total number of chairs rented in a 4-week month is 1200 + 800 = 2000.

Since we are asked to find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we multiply the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month by 2.

The total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months is 2000 * 2 = 4000.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. 
Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from this trade.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. 
Since each large button is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 large buttons from this trade.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
She had 40 large stickers initially and traded 20 for large buttons, so she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left. 
Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers from this trade.

Now, let's calculate the total number of buttons she has:
- She has 27 small buttons from the first trade.
- She has 20 large buttons from the second trade.
- She has 60 small buttons from the third trade.

So, the total number of buttons she has is 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 buttons.

"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic equation. Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as 'x'. Since the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it, the number of votes in favor can be represented as 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and the sum of votes in favor and against must equal the total number of council members. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Now that we know the number of votes against the new regulation (x = 11), we can find the number of votes in favor by multiplying x by 2:

Votes in favor = 2x = 2 * 11 = 22

The final answer is 22."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. 11 students need size extra-small.
2. Twice as many students need size small as extra small, so 2 * 11 = 22 students need size small.
3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.
4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up the total number of shirts needed:

"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that one third of the Pomeranians are girls. Since there are 6 Pomeranian girls, we can set up an equation to find the total number of Pomeranians.

Let's denote the total number of Pomeranians as P. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, so we can set up the equation:

(1/3)P = 6

To solve for P, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

P = 6 * 3
P = 18

Now that we know there are 18 Pomeranians, we can use the information that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let's denote the total number of puppies as T. We can set up another equation:

(2/3)T = 18

To solve for T, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3/2:

"To determine the number of cases of shingles the third house needs, we need to first calculate the number of cases needed for the first and second houses.

The total number of cases needed is 250. The first house needs half of this amount, which is 250 / 2 = 125 cases.

The second house needs double the amount of the first house, which is 2 * 125 = 250 cases.

Now, we can find the number of cases needed for the third house by subtracting the cases needed for the first and second houses from the total: 250 - 125 - 250 = -25. However, this is not possible since we cannot have a negative number of cases. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. The second house needs double the amount of the first house, which is 2 * 125 = 250 cases. This means the first house actually needs 125 cases, and the second house needs 250 cases. 

The third house needs double the amount of the first house, which is 2 * 125 = 250 cases.

So, the third house needs 250 cases of shingles.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many books Ahmed read. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of books Ahmed read as 'x'. 

Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can write the equation: 2x = 300. 

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 300 / 2 = 150.

Now that we know Ahmed read 150 books, we can find the total number of books they read altogether. Ezra read 300 books initially and decided to read 150 more, so the total number of books Ezra read is 300 + 150 = 450.

"To calculate Tanya's total earnings, we need to break it down by day and then add the earnings from both days.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her earnings from Monday would be 4 * 5 * $15 = $60. Additionally, she earns $5 per day for teaching more than 3 classes, so she earns an extra $5 on Monday. Therefore, her total earnings from Monday are $60 + $5 = $65.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her earnings from Wednesday would be 2 * 2 * $15 = $30. Since she teaches 2 classes, she earns an extra $5 on Wednesday. Therefore, her total earnings from Wednesday are $30 + $5 = $35.

7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours
3 hours (reading) = 12 - 3 = 9 hours remaining

Since she plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time, we calculate 1/3 of 9 hours:
9 hours * 1/3 = 3 hours

Now, we subtract the time spent on video games from the remaining time to find the time spent on soccer:
9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent on soccer by the total time and multiply by 100:
(6 hours / 12 hours) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Anthony started with 50 pencils.
2. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, which is 1/2 * 50 = 25 pencils. So, he has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.
3. Then, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie, which is 3/5 * 25 = 15 pencils. So, he has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Anthony kept 10 pencils.

"To determine the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes him to drive to the museum and back.

The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and Jack drives at 75 mph. The time it takes to drive to the museum is 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours. Since he drives back, the total driving time is 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours.

Adding the 6 hours he spends at the museum, the total time Jack is gone from home is 4 hours (driving) + 6 hours (at the museum) = 10 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the toys and subtract that from the total number of wheels available.

First, let's calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars: 57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels.

Next, let's calculate the total number of wheels required for the motorcycles: 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels.

Now, we add the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles: 228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels.

Finally, we subtract the total number of wheels required from the total number of wheels available: 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels.

The number of wheels that will be left is 276."
"To calculate the discount, we need to find 20% of the original price of the laptop, which is $1000. 

20% of $1000 is calculated as 0.20 * $1000 = $200.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price: $1000 - $200 = $800.

So, after applying the 20% discount, you have to pay $800.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how many movies are in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of movies in series = Total number of movies / 3
= 600 / 3
= 200

Now, we know that Mike can get these series for $6 each. So, the cost of the series is:

Cost of series = Number of movies in series * Cost per series
= 200 * 6
= $1200

Next, we need to find out how many remaining movies are not in series. Since 200 movies are in series, the remaining movies are:

Remaining movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies in series
= 600 - 200
= 400

Now, we know that 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, which cost $5 each. So, the number of older movies is:

Number of older movies = 40% of remaining movies
= 0.4 * 400
= 160

The cost of the older movies is:

Cost of older movies = Number of older movies * Cost per older movie
= 160 * 5
= $800

Now, we need to find the cost of the remaining movies, which are not in series and not older movies. These are the movies that are neither in series nor older movies. The number of these movies is:

Number of remaining movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies in series - Number of older movies
= 600 - 200 - 160
= 240

The cost of these remaining movies is:

Cost of remaining movies = Number of remaining movies * Cost per normal movie
= 240 * 10
= $2400

Now, we can find the total cost of replacing the movies by adding the cost of the series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the remaining movies:

Total cost = Cost of series + Cost of older movies + Cost of remaining movies
= $1200 + $800 + $2400
= $4400

The final answer is: $4400"
"To determine the total cost of the fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

The cost of peaches is 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00
The cost of plums is 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00
The cost of apricots is 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, let's add the costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the speed at which the family hiked. Since they hiked 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed, we can calculate it as follows:

Driving speed = 50 miles per hour
Half of the driving speed = 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour
Hiking speed = 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour

Now, we know the family hiked for 1.5 hours. We can use the formula distance = speed * time to find the distance they hiked:

Distance = speed * time
Distance = 20 miles per hour * 1.5 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Since the family drove for 6 hours, we can use the same formula to find the distance they drove:

Distance = speed * time
Distance = 50 miles per hour * 6 hours
Distance = 300 miles

The total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked:

Total distance = 300 miles + 30 miles
Total distance = 330 miles

The final answer is: 330"
"To determine the difference in scores, we need to calculate the points earned by each player and then subtract the lower score from the higher score.

Let's denote Emma's points as E and Ava's points as A.

Emma's points can be calculated as follows:
- She collects 3 fewer berries than Ava, so she collects 3 * 5 = 15 berries.
- She jumps on fewer enemies than Ava, so she jumps on 8 - 1 = 7 enemies.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, so she finishes the level for 4 seconds.

Emma's points = (7 * 10) + (15 * 5) + (60 - 4) = 70 + 75 + 56 = 201

Ava's points can be calculated as follows:
- She collects 3 more berries than Emma, so she collects 15 + 3 = 18 berries.
- She jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumps on 7 + 8 = 15 enemies.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so she finishes the level for 60 + 4 = 64 seconds.

Ava's points = (15 * 10) + (18 * 5) + 64 = 150 + 90 + 64 = 304

The difference between their scores is 304 - 201 = 103.

"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of 64 dollars. 

64 - 30 = 34

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can divide the remaining cost by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

34 / 2 = 17

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas cost 17 dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of times they ride their bikes on the three usual days and the two days when they ride twice the usual amount.

On the three usual days, they ride 3 times a day, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 times.

On the two days when they ride twice the usual amount, they ride 2 * 3 = 6 times each day. So, that's 2 * 6 = 12 times.

Now, we add the total number of times they ride on both types of days: 9 + 12 = 21 times.

Therefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 21 times a week.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as 'x'. Since he already had 4 white fish, the total number of white fish after buying 'x' more would be 4 + x.

We know that after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Initially, he had 3 orange fish. So, the total number of orange fish after buying 'x' more would be 3 + x.

Since the total number of orange fish is twice the total number of white fish, we can set up the equation:

3 + x = 2(4 + x)

Expanding the equation, we get:

3 + x = 8 + 2x

Subtracting 'x' from both sides gives us:

3 = 8 + x

Subtracting 8 from both sides gives us:

-5 = x

"To determine the weekly fuel consumption, we first need to calculate the daily fuel consumption. 

Since Andy uses his car to go to work from Monday to Friday, he drives 5 miles per day for 5 days, which equals 25 miles per week. 

Given that his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, we can calculate the weekly fuel consumption as follows:

Weekly fuel consumption = Total miles driven / Fuel efficiency
Weekly fuel consumption = 25 miles / 10 MPG
Weekly fuel consumption = 2.5 gallons

Now, we can calculate the weekly fuel cost:

Weekly fuel cost = Weekly fuel consumption * Price per gallon
Weekly fuel cost = 2.5 gallons * $3/gallon
Weekly fuel cost = $7.50

The final answer is: $7.50"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of money Carrie spent on the lunch. 

First, let's calculate the amount of money she spent on the quarters. Since she had 140 quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount spent on quarters is 140 * $0.25 = $35.

Next, let's calculate the amount of money she spent on the twenties. She had 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. 3/5 of 10 is (3/5) * 10 = 6. So, she spent 6 twenties, which is 6 * $20 = $120.

Now, let's add the amount spent on quarters and twenties to get the total amount spent on lunch. $35 + $120 = $155.

Therefore, Carrie spent a total of $155 on lunch.

The total cost of the trip is $300. Since the school is covering half the cost, the school will pay $300 / 2 = $150. 

John has $50. To find out how much he is missing, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost of the trip: $300 - $150 (school's contribution) - $50 (John's contribution) = $100.

John is missing $100."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the temperature difference between the day and night, and then calculate how many logs are needed to bridge that difference.

The temperature during the day is 45 degrees, and it's 33 degrees colder at night, so the temperature at night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since the pipes will freeze at 32 degrees, and the temperature at night is 12 degrees, Carson needs to heat the house up from 12 to 32 degrees. 

To do this, he needs to heat the house up by 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees, so the number of logs needed is 20 / 5 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total number of seashells brought back, we first need to determine the number of groups and the number of seashells each group brought back.

Given that 3/5 of the number of groups had members bring back seashells, and there are 90 people in total, we can calculate the number of groups as follows:

Number of groups = Total people / Group size
= 90 / 9
= 10

Since 3/5 of the groups had members bring back seashells, the number of groups that brought back seashells is:

Number of groups with seashells = 3/5 * 10
= 6

Each group brought back 2 seashells, so the total number of seashells brought back is:

Total seashells = Number of groups with seashells * Number of seashells per group
= 6 * 2
= 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the number of people on the train, we need to track the changes at each stop.

Initially, there are 172 people on the train.

At the first stop, 47 people get off, so the number of people left is 172 - 47 = 125.

Then, 13 more people get on, so the number of people on the train becomes 125 + 13 = 138.

At the next stop, 38 people get off, so the number of people left is 138 - 38 = 100.

Therefore, there are 100 people on the train.

"To determine Jamie's total earnings for the day, we need to calculate her earnings for the regular 8 hours and the additional hours she worked at the special rate.

First, let's calculate her earnings for the regular 8 hours:
8 hours * $20/hour = $160

Next, we need to calculate her earnings for the additional 3 hours she worked at the special rate (11 hours - 8 hours = 3 hours). The special rate is 150% of her regular rate, which is 1.5 * $20 = $30 per hour.
3 hours * $30/hour = $90

Now, we add her earnings for the regular hours and the special hours:
$160 + $90 = $250

Therefore, Jamie was paid $250 for her work that day.

"To determine the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to calculate the number of male lions first. Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, and there are 12 female lions, the number of male lions is 12 / 2 = 6.

Now, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions. 

12 (female lions) + 6 (male lions) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32

Therefore, there are 32 lions in the enclosure.

"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans and subtract it from the $50 bill.

The original price of the jeans is $40. Since they are 25% off, we need to calculate 25% of $40 and subtract it from $40.

25% of $40 = 0.25 * $40 = $10

Discounted price = Original price - Discount
Discounted price = $40 - $10
Discounted price = $30

Now, we subtract the discounted price from the $50 bill to find out how much money Mike will have left over.

Money left over = $50 - $30
Money left over = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first determine the total number of employees after three months. 

The company initially has 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. After one month, the total number of employees will be 200 + 20 = 220. After two months, the total number of employees will be 220 + 20 = 240. After three months, the total number of employees will be 240 + 20 = 260.

Since each employee is paid $4000 per month, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months can be calculated as follows:

Total amount = Number of employees * Salary per employee
Total amount = 260 * $4000
Total amount = $1,040,000

The final answer is: $1,040,000"

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the hourly wage of both Billy and Sally, and then find the difference in their earnings after working 20 hours.

Billy's initial hourly wage was $10. After 2 months, he received a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new hourly wage $10.50. On his first anniversary, he received another raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final hourly wage $11.50.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, so her starting hourly wage is $10.50. Since she also works 20 hours, her total earnings will be 20 * $10.50 = $210.

Billy's total earnings will be 20 * $11.50 = $230.

The difference in their earnings is $230 - $210 = $20.

"To determine the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students. There are 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class. So, the total number of students is 40 * 25 = 1000 students.

Since each student plants one tree, the total number of trees planted by the students is also 1000.

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers. There are 40 classes with an average of 3 teachers per class. So, the total number of teachers is 40 * 3 = 120 teachers.

Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by the teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

Now, we add the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers to get the total number of trees planted. Total trees = 1000 (students) + 240 (teachers) = 1240.

The final answer is: 1240"
"To find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has, we need to add the number of each type of stuffed animal she has: 

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Since Bubbles wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up an equation to represent this situation. Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she buys as 'x'. The total number of stuffed animals will then be 14 + x. 

The equation can be set up as follows: 
(14 + x) * 0.3 = x

Simplifying the equation:
4.2 + 0.3x = x

Subtract 0.3x from both sides:
4.2 = 0.7x

Divide both sides by 0.7:
x = 6

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To determine how many hours Kris needs to play to earn the achievement, we need to calculate the total hours she has already played and subtract that from the required 30 hours.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks is 14 days. So, she plays 0.5 * 14 = 7 hours in the first part of the period.

Then, she plays for 2 hours every day for a week, which is 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

Total hours played so far = 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

Since Kris needs 30 hours to earn the achievement, she still needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the relative motion of the two cars. Since they are moving in the same direction, we can calculate the relative speed between them. 

The relative speed is the difference between the speeds of the two cars, which is 70 - 60 = 10 miles per hour.

Since they are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is the rate at which the distance between them increases. 

To find the distance between them after 2 hours, we multiply the relative speed by the time: 

Distance = Relative Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 20 miles

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the premium first. The premium is 30% of the total cost of the diamond and gold. 

The total cost of the diamond and gold is $600 + $300 = $900. 

The premium is 30% of $900, which is 0.3 * $900 = $270.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the diamond and gold, and the premium. So, the total cost is $900 + $270 = $1170.

The final answer is: $1170"
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school. 

First, we know that 340 out of 500 third-graders passed, which is 68% of the total number of third-graders. 

Next, we know that 40 out of 100 fourth-graders passed, which is 40% of the total number of fourth-graders.

Since the pass rate for fifth graders is twice that of fourth graders, we can calculate the number of fifth graders who passed as 2 * 40 = 80.

Now, we can calculate the total number of students who passed: 
340 (third graders) + 40 (fourth graders) + 80 (fifth graders) = 460 students.

The total number of students in the school is 500 (third graders) + 100 (fourth graders) + 400 (fifth graders) = 900 students.

The overall pass rate is then 460 (students who passed) / 900 (total students) = 0.51 or 51%.

The final answer is: 51%"
"To determine the total number of square inches Milo can create with the glass chips, we first need to find out how many square inches he can make with one bag of chips. Since each bag holds 72 chips and it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, we divide 72 by 12 to get the number of square inches per bag.

72 / 12 = 6 square inches per bag

Since Milo has two bags, we multiply the number of square inches per bag by 2.

6 * 2 = 12 square inches

Now, we know that Milo can create 12 square inches of mosaic with two bags of glass chips. To find the length of the mosaic, we need to know the width. However, the question does not provide the width. Assuming the mosaic is a square (since it's not specified otherwise), we can find the length by taking the square root of the area.

Length = √Area
Length = √12
Length ≈ 3.46 inches

The final answer is: 3.46"
"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount each group drank and then add them together. 

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. 
16 students drank 2 quarts each, so 16 * 2 = 32 quarts. 

The total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we need to convert the total amount of tea consumed to gallons. 
38 quarts / 4 = 9.5 gallons.

To find the initial amount of tea, we need to add the consumed amount to the remaining amount. 
10 quarts (remaining) + 38 quarts (consumed) = 48 quarts.

Now, we convert the initial amount to gallons. 
48 quarts / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and subtract the number he has already sold.

Initially, Dale had 100 candies. He sold 150, but then he ordered 100 more. So, the total number of candies he has now is 100 (initial) + 100 (new order) = 200 candies.

Since he has 200 candies and he wants to sell all of them, we subtract the number he has sold (150) from the total number of candies he has: 200 - 150 = 50.

Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

- End of February: 20 * 2 = 40 students
- End of March: 40 * 2 = 80 students
- End of April: 80 * 2 = 160 students
- End of May: 160 * 2 = 320 students

The number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year is 10. To find the additional students by the end of May, we subtract the initial number from the total number of students at the end of May: 320 - 10 = 310.

The final answer is: 310"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of branches Felix climbed. Since he made $105 in total and charges $0.25 per branch, we can divide the total amount by the cost per branch to find the total number of branches.

Total amount made = $105
Cost per branch = $0.25
Total branches = Total amount made / Cost per branch
Total branches = $105 / $0.25
Total branches = 420

Since Felix made this money over the course of a week (7 days), we can divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches / 7
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 x 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 x 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 x 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add the total number of petals for each set: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

However, Rose dropped 1 of each type of flower, so we need to subtract 1 for each type of flower. Since there are 4 types of flowers, we subtract 4 from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

The total number of petals in the vase is 97."
"To determine the number of S'mores each kid can have, we first need to calculate the total number of marshmallows used and subtract that from the total number of marshmallows in the bag.

John made 9 S'mores, and DeSean made 9 S'mores, so together they made 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they used 18 marshmallows.

Initially, the bag had 35 marshmallows. After using 18 marshmallows, they had 35 - 18 = 17 marshmallows left.

However, they dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, so they had 17 - 3 = 14 marshmallows left.

Since each S'more requires one marshmallow, the number of S'mores they can make with the remaining marshmallows is 14.

To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we divide the remaining marshmallows by 2, as they are making S'mores together. 

14 / 2 = 7

So, each kid can have 7 S'mores."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person played and then determine how much money was spent.

First, let's convert 4 hours to minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time each person played:

- Jack played for 20 minutes.
- One of his friends played for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes.
- The other friend played for 10 minutes.

The better friend played for 1.5 * 20 = 30 minutes.

Now, let's add up the total time played: 20 + 10 + 10 + 30 = 70 minutes.

Since Jack played for 20 minutes, the other three friends played for 50 minutes in total (70 - 20 = 50). 

Now, let's calculate the cost of the games played by each person:

- Jack played for 20 minutes, so he spent 1 quarter = $0.25.
- The other three friends played for 50 minutes, so each of them spent 50 / 20 = 2.5 quarters = $0.625.

The total cost is the sum of the costs of all the games played: $0.25 + 3 * $0.625 = $0.25 + $1.875 = $2.125.

The final answer is: $2.125"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the amount of salt as S, the amount of oil as O, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of citrus zest as Z, and the amount of sugar as G. 

We are given the following information:
1. Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so Z = F.
2. Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so S = G.
3. Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.
4. The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so S + O + F + Z + G = 10.

Substituting the given information into the total equation, we get:
S + O + F + Z + G = 10
S + O + F + S + S = 10 (since S = G and Z = F)
2S + O + F + F = 10
2S + O + 2F = 10

Now, we can substitute O = 2S into the equation:
2S + 2S + 2F = 10
4S + 2F = 10

We also know that O = 2S and S = G, so we can substitute S for G in the total equation:
S + O + F + S + S = 10
S + 2S + F + S + S = 10
4S + F = 10

Now we have two equations:
4S + 2F = 10
4S + F = 10

Subtracting the second equation from the first equation, we get:
(4S + 2F) - (4S + F) = 10 - 10
F = 0

Since F = 0, we can substitute F into the equation 4S + F = 10:
4S + 0 = 10
4S = 10
S = 10/4
S = 2.5

Now that we know S, we can find O:
O = 2S
O = 2 * 2.5
O = 5

The final answer is 5."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars he sells, we need to calculate 20% of 40, which is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

Now, Joe has 40 - 8 = 32 cars left after selling 20%.

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

Finally, Joe has 32 - 16 = 16 cars left after selling and giving some to his mother.

Amount raised by students = Total amount raised by charity - Amount raised by organizations
Amount raised by students = $175,000 - $50,000
Amount raised by students = $125,000

Since there are 20 students, we can find out how much each student raised by dividing the total amount raised by students by the number of students.

Amount raised by each student = Amount raised by students / Number of students
Amount raised by each student = $125,000 / 20
Amount raised by each student = $6,250

"To calculate the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to first find the time she walked on the second day. 

Since she walked half as many hours on the second day as she walked on the first day, we can calculate the time she walked on the second day as follows:

Time on the first day = 8 hours
Time on the second day = 8 / 2 = 4 hours

Now, we can calculate the total time by adding the time she walked on both days:

Total time = Time on the first day + Time on the second day
Total time = 8 hours + 4 hours
Total time = 12 hours

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60:

Total time (in minutes) = 12 hours * 60 minutes/hour
Total time (in minutes) = 720 minutes

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has:

Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book and the refund she will receive.

First, let's calculate the cost of shipping the book. The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound. So, the cost of shipping the book is 4 * $0.35 = $1.40.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book 20 miles. The shipping company charges $0.08 per mile, so the cost of shipping the book 20 miles is 20 * $0.08 = $1.60.

The total cost of shipping the book is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Now, let's calculate the refund Milly will receive. The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price. So, the refund will be 0.75 * $32 = $24.

Since Milly will have to pay $3.00 for shipping, she will lose $3.00 - $24 = -$21.00.

However, since Milly is losing money, we can say she will lose $21.00.

"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the initial amount she had.

Mulan initially had $40. Her father gave her $100, so she now has $40 + $100 = $140.

She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so the total cost of the jeans is 2 * $30 = $60.

Adding the cost of the jeans to the amount she already had, we get $140 + $60 = $200.

Finally, she buys a bag for $20, so the total amount she spent is $200 + $20 = $220.

To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount she had: $140 - $220 = -$80.

However, since Mulan can't have a negative amount of money, this means she actually spent more than she had. In this case, we need to consider that she didn't have enough money to buy the items she wanted.

The correct answer is: $0"
"To determine how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to analyze the production pattern.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find out how much he produces in the fourth week, we need to know the pattern or a specific rule that governs the production. However, the problem does not provide any information about the production pattern for the fourth week. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact amount produced in the fourth week.

The information given only provides the production for the first three weeks, and we cannot make any assumptions or predictions about the fourth week.

The answer is: Cannot be determined."
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on each activity and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time she spends on TikTok videos:
- She records 18 videos per week, and each video is 4 minutes long. 
- So, the total time spent on recording videos per week is 18 * 4 = 72 minutes.
- Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total time spent on recording videos in a month is 72 * 4 = 288 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time she spends on makeup:
- She spends 15 minutes per day, 6 days a week, doing her makeup.
- So, the total time spent on makeup per week is 15 * 6 = 90 minutes.
- The total time spent on makeup in a month is 90 * 4 = 360 minutes.

Now, let's add the time spent on recording videos and makeup to find the total time spent on TikTok in a month:
- Total time spent on TikTok in a month = 288 minutes (recording videos) + 360 minutes (doing makeup) = 648 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60:
- 648 minutes / 60 = 10.8 hours.

The final answer is: 10.8"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to first determine the number of additional items Angela needs to have installed. 

She has 6 mirrors, but the firm offers installation for 4 mirrors, so she needs 6 - 4 = 2 additional mirrors. 
She has 2 chandeliers, but the firm offers installation for 1 chandelier, so she needs 2 - 1 = 1 additional chandelier.
She has 20 pictures, but the firm offers installation for 10 pictures, so she needs 20 - 10 = 10 additional pictures.

Now, we can calculate the total number of additional items: 2 mirrors + 1 chandelier + 10 pictures = 13 items.

The cost of installation for these additional items is 13 * $15.00 = $195.00.

The cost of the initial installation is $129.00. Therefore, the total cost for Angela will be $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

We know that Eva has saved $20.00. Since Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply Anthony's savings by 0.4. 40% of $30.00 is 0.4 * $30.00 = $12.00.

Since Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, we add the 40% to Anthony's savings to find Roy's total savings. $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

Therefore, Roy has $42.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the mountains that each person can lift. 

We know that Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. Since Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, Saskay can lift 12 inches. 

Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches. 

Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 since there are 12 inches in a foot. 

480 / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance covered in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance covered in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance covered in the first 4 hours + Distance covered in the next 6 hours
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we first need to establish the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles. Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of the kangaroos, if we denote the speed of a kangaroo as 's', then the speed of a turtle would be 's/2'.

We know that 3 kangaroos can cover the distance in 18 hours. So, the total distance covered by the kangaroos is 3s * 18. 

Now, we need to find the time it takes for 4 turtles to cover the same distance. Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of the kangaroos, the total distance covered by the turtles would be the same as the kangaroos, which is 3s * 18.

The time taken by the turtles can be calculated as distance/speed. So, the time taken by 4 turtles would be (3s * 18) / (4 * (s/2)).

Simplifying the expression, we get (3s * 18) / (4 * (s/2)) = (3 * 18) / 2 = 54 / 2 = 27.

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of clay dishes each person made. 

We know Kora made 20 dishes. Since Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.

Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, we can add up the number of dishes each person made to find the total number of dishes: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140.

The total number of clay dishes they all make together is 140."
"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop and receiving the additional help from her mom.

First, let's calculate the price of the laptop after trading in her old one: $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika already had some savings in her purse, but we don't know the exact amount. Let's call this amount 'x'. She also received $150 for her part-time job and $80 from her mom. 

We know that after all these transactions, she only needs $50 more to buy the laptop. So, the total amount she has is equal to the price of the laptop minus the amount she needs: x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50.

Now, let's solve for x: x + 230 = 350. Subtracting 230 from both sides, we get x = 120.

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of apple slices Adam initially had and then subtract the number of slices he ate.

Adam had 3 large apples, which can be sliced into 3 * 5 = 15 slices.
He also had 5 small apples, which can be sliced into 5 * 3 = 15 slices.
So, the total number of apple slices Adam initially had is 15 + 15 = 30 slices.

Adam ate 15 slices, so the number of slices left is 30 - 15 = 15.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total amount of milk the farmer currently produces. Since he extracts 5 liters a day from 3 cows, the total amount of milk he produces is 5 liters * 3 cows = 15 liters per day.

To produce 25 liters of milk per day, the farmer needs to increase his milk production by 25 - 15 = 10 liters per day.

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, the farmer needs to have 10 liters / 5 liters per cow = 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk per day.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to first find the length of each glue stick that is not used.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply the original length by the fraction used: 5/6 * 12 mm = 10 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 mm - 10 mm = 2 mm.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply the original length by the fraction used: 1/3 * 12 mm = 4 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 mm - 4 mm = 8 mm.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply the original length by the fraction used: 1/2 * 12 mm = 6 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 mm - 6 mm = 6 mm.

Now, we add the lengths of the unused parts: 2 mm + 8 mm + 6 mm = 16 mm.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 mm."
"To determine how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total amount he has and subtract it from the total cost of the items he wants to buy.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200, so the total amount he has is $5000 + $200 = $5200.

The total cost of the items he wants to buy is $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10800.

To find out how much he still needs, we subtract the total amount he has from the total cost: $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5600.

"To determine how much money Craig has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from the initial amount of money he had.

Craig initially had 2 twenty-dollar bills, which is 2 * $20 = $40.

He spent $2 on each of the 6 squirt guns, so the total cost of the squirt guns is 6 * $2 = $12.

He also spent $3 on each of the 3 packs of water balloons, so the total cost of the water balloons is 3 * $3 = $9.

The total amount Craig spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

Craig has $19 left.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of socks Peter and Jack have. 

Since Jack collected 60 dishes and he has half as many dishes as Peter, Peter has 60 * 2 = 120 dishes. 

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, and Jack has 60 dishes, we can assume that Jack has 60 / 2 = 30 socks. 

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, Peter has 30 * 2 = 60 socks.

Now, we can calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together. 

Total number of socks = 60 (Peter's socks) + 30 (Jack's socks) = 90 socks.

Total number of dishes = 120 (Peter's dishes) + 60 (Jack's dishes) = 180 dishes.

Therefore, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is 90 + 180 = 270."
"To find the number of students good at both math and English, we need to subtract the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at English only from the total number of students.

Number of students good at math only = 5
Number of students good at English only = 8
Total number of students = 20

Number of students good at both math and English = Total number of students - (Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at English only)
= 20 - (5 + 8)
= 20 - 13
= 7

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at both math and English.

Total number of students good at math = Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at both math and English

"To determine the number of groups that can perform, we need to calculate the total time available for performances. 

The total time for each group is 2 minutes (getting on stage) + 6 minutes (performing) + 2 minutes (exiting) = 10 minutes.

The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. 

Subtracting the time for the intermission (10 minutes) from the total time, we get 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Now, we divide the remaining time by the time per group (10 minutes) to find the number of groups that can perform: 110 / 10 = 11.

Therefore, Vicki can have 11 groups perform in the concert.

"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest earned each year and add it to the principal amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year.

Year 1: Principal + Interest = $300 + $225 = $525
Year 2: $525 + $225 = $750
Year 3: $750 + $225 = $975

So, Brenda will have a total of $975 after 3 years.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of white shirts with no collars and the number of floral shirts with no buttons.

Since half of the white shirts have collars, the other half do not. Therefore, the number of white shirts with no collars is 40 / 2 = 20.

We are given that 20 of the floral shirts have buttons. To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we subtract the number of floral shirts with buttons from the total number of floral shirts: 50 - 20 = 30.

Now, we can find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars: 30 - 20 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of trays the farmer can fill with 900 eggs. 

Number of trays = Total eggs / Eggs per tray
Number of trays = 900 / 30
Number of trays = 30

Since the farmer sells each tray for $2.5, the total earnings can be calculated as follows:

Total earnings = Number of trays * Price per tray
Total earnings = 30 * $2.5
Total earnings = $75

The farmer will earn $75 if he sells all the eggs in 30 trays."
"To determine the total number of goats left in both farms, we need to calculate the number of goats sold from each farm and subtract that from the initial number of goats in each farm.

Initially, Farm X had 55 goats and Farm Y had 45 goats.

Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, leaving 55 - 10 = 45 goats in Farm X.

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y. So, Farm Y is left with 45 - 20 = 25 goats.

Now, we add the number of goats left in both farms: 45 (from Farm X) + 25 (from Farm Y) = 70 goats.

The total number of goats left in both farms is 70."
"To find the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount spent on shoes in a year by the number of pairs purchased in a year.

First, let's calculate the total number of pairs of shoes purchased in a year. Since James buys 2 pairs per month, and there are 12 months in a year, he buys 2 * 12 = 24 pairs of shoes per year.

Now, we can divide the total amount spent on shoes in a year ($2640) by the total number of pairs purchased in a year (24) to find the average cost per pair:

$2640 ÷ 24 = $110

The average cost of each pair of shoes is $110."

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $18 = $54.

Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, the actual cost of the red food will be $54 - $6 = $48.

The total cost will be the sum of the cost of the green food and the cost of the red food, which is $75 + $48 = $123.

"To find the total time required to clean half of the rooms, we first need to calculate the number of rooms that need to be cleaned, which is half of 90, or 45 rooms.

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean one room, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room: 45 rooms * 20 minutes per room = 900 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide the total minutes by 60: 900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours.

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

"To solve this problem, let's assign variables to each person's age. Let's say your brother's age is B, your sister's age is S, and your age is A.

From the given information, we have the following equations:

1. A = B - 3 (You are three years younger than your brother)
2. A = S + 2 (You are 2 years older than your sister)
3. 3B - 1 = A (Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age)

We can substitute equation 1 into equation 3 to get:

"To determine the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required. Since each student needs 2 glue sticks, and there are 27 students, the total number of glue sticks required is 27 * 2 = 54.

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by 8 to find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy. 

54 / 8 = 6.75

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the sequence of events and apply basic arithmetic operations.

Initially, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

On the first day, the amount of water doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the second day, the amount of water doubles again, so it becomes 2 * 8000 = 16000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 16000 + 6000 = 22000 gallons.

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 22000 gallons.

Final answer: 22000"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. 

Initially, there are 10 people infected. 

Day 1: 10 people infect 6 others, so the total number of infected people becomes 10 + 6 = 16.

Day 2: The 16 people from Day 1 infect 6 others each, so the total number of infected people becomes 16 + (16 * 6) = 16 + 96 = 112.

Day 3: The 112 people from Day 2 infect 6 others each, so the total number of infected people becomes 112 + (112 * 6) = 112 + 672 = 784.

Therefore, after three days, there are 784 people infected.

"To find the total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela, we first need to calculate the amount of tips each of them received.

Rafaela received $20 from each of the 40 customers, so the total amount of tips she received is 20 * 40 = $800.

Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find the amount of tips Julieta received, we need to calculate 10% of Rafaela's tips and subtract it from Rafaela's total. 10% of $800 is 0.1 * 800 = $80. So, Julieta received $800 - $80 = $720.

The total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela is $800 + $720 = $1520.

The final answer is: $1520"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of oranges Jennifer gave away and subtract that from the initial number of oranges she bought.

Jennifer gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, so she gave away 3 x 2 = 6 oranges.

She also gave 3 oranges to her son.

In total, Jennifer gave away 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Jennifer initially bought 12 oranges. After giving away 9 oranges, she is left with 12 - 9 = 3 oranges.

Therefore, Jennifer remains with 3 oranges.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 12 badges.

Since it takes Amber twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, Amber earns 1/2 of Claire's monthly earnings. Therefore, Amber earns 1/2 badge per month, which is 6 badges in a year.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. So, Wendy earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract Amber's total from Wendy's total: 36 - 6 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total amount raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices baked and sold. 

Paige bakes 2 loaves per hour, and she bakes for 5 hours (from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM). So, she bakes 2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is equivalent to $0.50. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the number of slices sold by the price per slice: 80 slices * $0.50/slice = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of silver coins Gretchen has. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation: 

Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Then, the number of gold coins is 'x + 30'. We know that Gretchen has 70 gold coins, so we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 70

Subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation gives us:

x = 40

Now that we know Gretchen has 40 silver coins, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of silver coins and gold coins:

Total coins = 40 (silver) + 70 (gold) = 110

Therefore, Gretchen has 110 coins in total.

"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we first need to calculate the total number of burritos given to the students. Since there were 50 students and each student received 10 burritos, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

However, Mr. George ate 20 burritos, so we need to subtract those from the total number of burritos given to the students. The total number of leftover burritos is 500 - 20 = 480.

Therefore, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 480.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know the rink has 12 red cars. Since they have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

We also know that they have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars. So, the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we know the total number of cars is 75. We have already accounted for 12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52 cars. 

To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the total number of other cars from the total number of cars: 75 - 52 = 23.

Therefore, the rink has 23 yellow cars.

"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as 'F', the number of books Anne has as 'A', and the number of books Sofie has as 'S'. 

We are given the following information:
1. S + A + F = 85 (Total number of books)
2. S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get:
(A + 25) + A + F = 85
Combine like terms:
2A + F + 25 = 85

Now, substitute the third equation into the previous equation:
2(F - 12) + F + 25 = 85
Expand the equation:
2F - 24 + F + 25 = 85
Combine like terms:
3F + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:
3F = 84

Divide both sides by 3:
F = 28

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

Next, we need to find the weight of the carrots. The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the carrots weigh 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Therefore, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots.

"To determine the total amount of jello Greg needs, we first need to calculate the total number of jello cups required. Since there are 30 kids and each kid needs 4 jello cups, the total number of cups needed is 30 * 4 = 120 cups.

Since a three-ounce box of flavored jello makes 10 small jello cups, we need to calculate how many boxes are required to make 120 cups. To do this, we divide the total number of cups needed by the number of cups per box: 120 / 10 = 12 boxes.

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of the jello. Since each box costs $1.25, we multiply the number of boxes needed by the cost per box: 12 * $1.25 = $15.

Therefore, Greg will spend $15 on jello for his son's birthday party.

The seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to calculate the total amount Keenan pays per month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

First, we calculate 40% of the total monthly cost: 
40% of $400 = 0.4 * $400 = $160

Since there are four weeks in a month, we divide the monthly cost by 4 to find the weekly cost:
$160 / 4 = $40

Therefore, Keenan spends $40 per week.

"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day and add them together.

First, let's find out how many pieces Tobias ate on the first day. Since he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces, we can calculate it as follows:

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, Tobias ate 24 pieces on the first day.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's find out how many pieces are left after the first two days. We subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total:

60 - 24 - 10 = 26

Now, let's find out how many pieces Tobias ate on the third day. He ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces:

7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14

So, Tobias ate 14 pieces on the third day.

Now, let's add up the pieces eaten on each day:

24 + 10 + 14 = 48

Tobias has eaten 48 pieces so far.

"To find out how much money David has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the bolts and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

The cost of one bolt is $0.03. Since David wants to buy 16 bolts, the total cost will be 16 * $0.03 = $0.48.

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount of money David has: $12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00.

David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts."
"To determine Ella's hourly wage, we need to divide her earnings by the number of hours she worked. 

$33 ÷ 3 hours = $11 per hour

$11 per hour × 12 hours = $132

The final answer is 132."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. 

First, we add the marbles Paul initially had to the marbles his friend gave him: 52 + 28 = 80.

Then, we calculate 1/4 of the total marbles Paul had after receiving the marbles from his friend: 1/4 * 80 = 20.

Now, we subtract the marbles Paul lost from the total: 80 - 20 = 60.

So, Paul has 60 marbles left.

"To determine the cost of the chicken Isaias bought, we first need to find out how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he plans to sell 3/5 of his 300 chickens, we can calculate this as follows:

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Since he plans to sell these 180 chickens at $50 each, the total revenue from selling these chickens will be:

180 * $50 = $9000

However, Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. This means his total cost should be $9000 - $2000 = $7000.

Now, to find the cost of one chicken, we divide the total cost by the number of chickens:

$7000 / 180 = $38.89

So, Isaias bought the chicken he took to the market for approximately $38.89.

$38.89"
"To find out how many glasses Micah sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by the boys (Micah and Mitchell) by 2, since they sold an equal number of glasses. 

32 glasses / 2 = 16 glasses per boy.

Since Julie sold 14 glasses, we can find the difference by subtracting the number of glasses Micah sold from Julie's sales.

14 (Julie's sales) - 16 (Micah's sales) = -2

However, since Micah sold fewer glasses than Julie, the result is negative. This indicates that Julie sold 2 fewer glasses than Micah.

The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the manicure, which is 3/4 * $100 = $75.

Now, we add the costs of all services together: $400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575.

The total amount Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"To determine how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to calculate the cost of the new rope and subtract it from the amount she has.

The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and it's 20 meters long. So, the total cost of the new rope is 20 * $1.5 = $30.

Sarah's friend is willing to sell the rope to her for $2 per meter. Since the rope is 20 meters long, the total amount she will receive from selling the rope is 20 * $2 = $40.

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the amount she will receive: $40 - $30 = $10.

Therefore, Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Melanie's current age. Since she will be 18 in 10 years, her current age is 18 - 10 = 8 years.

Now, we need to find the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age. Let's denote this number of years as 'x'. 

We can set up the equation: 8 + x = 3 * 8

Simplifying the equation, we get: 8 + x = 24

Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get: x = 16

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

"To determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart.

First, we know that 5 packs of bacon cost $10. Since each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, the cost of each pack of chicken is $10 * 2 = $20. Therefore, 6 packets of chicken cost 6 * $20 = $120.

Next, we know that 3 packs of strawberries cost $4 each, so the total cost of strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

Lastly, 7 packs of apples cost half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. Therefore, the total cost of apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart by adding the costs of bacon, chicken, strawberries, and apples: $10 + $120 + $12 + $14 = $156.

Since Kelly's budget is $65, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget to find out how much money she has left: $65 - $156 = -$91.

However, since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this indicates that Kelly does not have enough money in her budget to buy all the items in her cart."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total runtime of the final concert, which includes the encore. We know that the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts and that the encore is 15 minutes long. Let's denote the runtime of her usual concerts as 'x'. 

Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, the total runtime of the final concert is 2x. We are also given that the total runtime of the final concert, including the encore, is 65 minutes. 

We can set up the equation: 2x + 15 = 65

Subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation gives us: 2x = 50

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2 gives us: x = 25

Therefore, her usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

Let's calculate 80% of 50 microphones: 
80% of 50 = 0.8 * 50 = 40

Since each pair consists of two microphones, we need to divide the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs by 2 to find the number of pairs:

To find the total number of petals on the daisies, we multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 4 daisies * 10 petals = 40 petals.

Now, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies to find the difference: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

The daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids."
"To find the number of flowering plants, we first need to determine the number of indoor and outdoor plants.

Since one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, we can calculate this as follows:
100 * (1/4) = 25 indoor plants

The remaining plants are outdoor plants. Since two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants, we can calculate this as follows:
Remaining plants = 100 - 25 = 75
75 * (2/3) = 50 outdoor plants

Now, we can find the number of flowering plants by subtracting the number of indoor and outdoor plants from the total number of plants:
100 - 25 - 50 = 25 flowering plants

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we can divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100:
(25 / 100) * 100 = 25%

The final answer is 25."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the speeds of the whirligig, the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit. 

We know that the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob. If we denote the speed of the thingamabob as 'x', then the speed of the whatchamacallit is 11x.

We are also given that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. So, we can set up the equation 11x = 121 to find the speed of the thingamabob.

Solving for x, we get x = 121 / 11 = 11 meters per second.

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which spins five times faster than the thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the whirligig is 5x = 5 * 11 = 55 meters per second.

The final answer is: 55"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the cost of the yogurt. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

Now, we know that Ellen pays $11 in total for her daily goods. We also know that she eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. So, the total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.

To find the cost of the carrots, we subtract the cost of the salad and yogurt from the total daily cost: $11 - $9 = $2.

Since Ellen eats two carrots every day, the cost of one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To calculate Mark's new weekly earnings, we need to first calculate his new hourly wage. 

His original hourly wage was $10, and it was raised by $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Since Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, we multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works per week and the number of days he works per week.

Weekly earnings = (new hourly wage) * (hours worked per day) * (days worked per week)
Weekly earnings = $12 * 8 * 5
Weekly earnings = $480

The final answer is: $480"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much Tasha made from mowing lawns. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. Then, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times. 

Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and we know that she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times, we can set up the equation 6x = total earnings from mowing lawns. 

We also know that she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times, so the total number of times she mowed lawns is 3x + 5x = 8x. 

Since Tasha made $80 in total, we can set up the equation 6x + 80 = 80. Solving for x, we get 6x = 0, which is not possible. This means our initial assumption is incorrect. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that Tasha made $80 in total, and she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn. So, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 80 - 6 = 74. 

Now, we can set up the equation 6x = 74. Solving for x, we get x = 74/6, which is approximately 12.33. 

Since x must be a whole number, our initial assumption is still incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the problem again. 

We know that Tasha made $80 in total, and she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn. So, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 80 - 6 = 74. 

Let's try to find a combination of 3x and 5x that adds up to 74. 

One possible combination is 3x = 30 and 5x = 44. However, this is not possible since 3x and 5x must be whole numbers. 

Another possible combination is 3x = 20 and 5x = 54. However, this is also not possible since 3x and 5x must be whole numbers. 

A possible combination is 3x = 24 and 5x = 50. 

Now, we can solve for x: 3x = 24, x = 8. 

So, Tasha mowed Joe's lawn 8 times, Kamala's lawn 24 times, and Alba's lawn 40 times. 

Now, we can calculate the total amount she made from mowing lawns: 8 * 6 + 24 * 6 + 40 * 6 = 48 + 144 + 240 = 432. However, this is not the correct answer.

"To find Harry's weight, we need to follow the given information step by step. 

First, we know Martin's weight is 55 kg. 
Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

"To determine John's profit, we need to calculate his total monthly income from renting out his car and subtract his car payment.

First, let's calculate his total monthly income from renting out his car. He rents it out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so his total hours per month is 10 * 3 = 30 hours. Since he gets paid $25 per hour, his total monthly income is 30 * $25 = $750.

Now, we subtract his car payment of $500 from his total monthly income to find his profit. 

$750 - $500 = $250

The final answer is: $250"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many notebooks Joseph had initially. Since Martha had 7 notebooks and she had 3 times as many as Joseph, we can set up an equation to find Joseph's initial number of notebooks.

Let's denote Joseph's initial number of notebooks as J. Since Martha had 3 times as many notebooks as Joseph, we can write the equation:

3J = 7

To find J, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

J = 7 / 3
J = 2.33

So, Joseph initially had 2.33 notebooks.

Now, we know Martha bought 5 more notebooks, so she now has 7 + 5 = 12 notebooks.

To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract Joseph's initial number of notebooks from Martha's current number of notebooks:

12 - 2.33 = 9.67

So, Martha now has 9.67 more notebooks than Joseph.

"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we need to first calculate the distance Anis rowed. Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis' distance as follows:

Anis' distance = Dijana's distance + (1/5 * Dijana's distance)
Anis' distance = 50 + (1/5 * 50)
Anis' distance = 50 + 10
Anis' distance = 60

Now, we can find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis by adding their individual distances:

Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis' distance
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we first need to determine the total number of cookies left after Susan's husband took 4 cookies. 

Initially, Susan had 100 cookies. After her husband took 4, she had 100 - 4 = 96 cookies left.

Now, we divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews, which is 6. 

96 / 6 = 16

So, each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pages Denise read yesterday and today, and then find the difference between the total pages read by Denise and Daniel.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more pages than what Daniel read yesterday, which is 13 + 5 = 18 pages. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, his total is still 13 pages.

Now, let's calculate the total pages read by Denise and Daniel. Denise read 10 + 18 = 28 pages, and Daniel read 13 pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract Daniel's total from Denise's total: 28 - 13 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we first need to calculate the total number of bowls of soup Calvin has. Since the pot can fill four adult bowls or eight child's bowls, we can say that the pot can fill 4x2 = 8 bowls in total.

Calvin and his wife are adults, so they will eat 2 bowls. This leaves 8 - 2 = 6 bowls of soup.

There are two children, so we divide the remaining 6 bowls by 2 to find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch. 6 / 2 = 3.

Therefore, each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch 3 times.

"To determine the total amount of material needed, we need to calculate the material required for each type of mask and then add them together.

For small masks, Jo needs 2 yards of material per mask. To make 20 small masks, she would need 20 * 2 = 40 yards of material.

For large masks, Jo needs 2.25 yards of material per mask. To make 8 large masks, she would need 8 * 2.25 = 18 yards of material.

To find the total amount of material needed, we add the material required for small and large masks: 40 + 18 = 58 yards.

The average price per ticket is $8."
"To determine Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total time he spends on sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night, so in a 24-hour day, he sleeps for 10 hours. 
He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours.
He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's calculate the total time Harold spends on these activities: 
10 hours (sleeping) + 8 hours (working) + 1 hour (walking the dog) = 19 hours

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we subtract the total time Harold spends on these activities from the total hours in a day to find his free time:
24 hours - 19 hours = 5 hours

Therefore, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many red shoeboxes Tim used for fishing. Since he used 1/3 of his red shoeboxes, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of red shoeboxes used = Total number of red shoeboxes * 1/3
= 9 * 1/3
= 3

Now, we know that Tim used 3 blue shoeboxes for fishing. To find out how many blue shoeboxes are left, we subtract the number of blue shoeboxes used from the total number of blue shoeboxes:

Number of blue shoeboxes left = Total number of blue shoeboxes - Number of blue shoeboxes used
= 7 - 3
= 4

To find the total number of shoeboxes left, we need to subtract the number of red and blue shoeboxes used from the total number of shoeboxes:

Total number of shoeboxes left = Total number of blue shoeboxes + Total number of red shoeboxes - (Number of blue shoeboxes used + Number of red shoeboxes used)
= 7 + 9 - (3 + 3)
= 7 + 9 - 6
= 10

So, Tim has 4 blue shoeboxes and 6 red shoeboxes left.

4 (blue) + 6 (red) = 10"
"To find the number of books Joseph currently has, we need to first determine how many books he had initially. Since Joseph had twice the number of Sarah's books, and Sarah has 9 books, Joseph initially had 2 * 9 = 18 books.

However, Joseph lost 2 books, so we need to subtract 2 from the initial number of books he had. 

18 - 2 = 16

Joseph currently has 16 books."
"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to first calculate how many marbles he gave away. 

He gave 1/5 of 30 marbles to Jamie, which is (1/5) * 30 = 6 marbles. 

Then, he gave 10 marbles to Donald. 

So, the total number of marbles Dean gave away is 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

Now, we subtract the marbles given away from the total number of marbles Dean initially had: 30 - 16 = 14.

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We are given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be expressed as:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

We are also given that Duncan's current age is 60. So, D = 60.

Substituting D = 60 into the equation, we get:

60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)
52 = 2A - 8

Now, let's solve for A:

52 + 8 = 2A
60 = 2A
A = 30

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

A + 8 = 30 + 8
A + 8 = 38

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

The final answer is: 38"

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that, so it is 2 * 200 + 100 = 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we add the two farm sizes together: 200 + 500 = 700 acres.

The two farms have 700 acres together."
"To determine Colby's earnings, we need to first calculate the number of packages he completes in an 8-hour workday. 

He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour. 

Since he works for 8 hours, he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages in a typical 8-hour workday.

He gets paid $0.20 for every package, so his total earnings for the day would be 320 * $0.20 = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time John spends on both the normal and extreme sudoku puzzles. 

First, let's calculate the time for the normal sudoku: 45 minutes. 

Since the extreme sudoku takes 4 times as long, the time for the extreme sudoku is 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Now, we need to add the time for both puzzles: 45 + 180 = 225 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to divide the total time by 30 minutes to find out how many bottles he drinks: 225 / 30 = 7.5.

So, John drinks 7.5 bottles of water in that time.

7.5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons. Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and there are 20 red balloons, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

We know that Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna at the bundle of red and yellow balloons. Since 40 pieces were thrown at the red balloons, the remaining pieces must have been thrown at the yellow balloons. 

So, the number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons is 58 - 40 = 18.

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons can be calculated by dividing the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons by 3. 

Number of yellow balloons = 18 / 3 = 6.

Therefore, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

"To determine the number of tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total distance he drives in 30 days. 

Since Jon drives 100 miles a day, the total distance driven in 30 days is 100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles.

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can divide the total distance driven by 1000 to find the number of tune-ups needed: 3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total hours Bruce works in the three days, we need to calculate the hours he works each day.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.
On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours he works each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

The final answer is: 23"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money spent by the girls and then divide it by 2 to find out how much their mother gave each of them.

First, let's calculate the cost of the balloons. Since 1 dozen balloons cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, 1 balloon costs $0.5 / 2 = $0.25. So, 12 balloons cost $0.25 * 12 = $3.

The total cost of the items purchased is the cost of the cake ($11) + the cost of the balloons ($3) + the cost of the ice cream (2 * $7 = $14). So, the total cost is $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since the girls combined their allowance, the total amount of money they had is equal to the total cost of the items purchased, which is $28. 

To find out how much their mother gave each of them, we need to divide the total amount of money by 2. $28 / 2 = $14.

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14.

14"
"To find the total number of pieces of fruit Kira bought, we need to add the number of apples, bananas, and oranges together. 

3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14

Since Lola ate 2 pieces of fruit, we subtract 2 from the total number of pieces.

14 - 2 = 12

There are 12 pieces of fruit left."
"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students in each sport and then add them together.

There are 6 students playing tennis and twice that number playing volleyball, so there are 6 * 2 = 12 students playing volleyball.

The total number of students playing sports is 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) = 18.

There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so the total number of students playing soccer is 16 + 22 = 38.

Now, we add the total number of students playing sports: 18 (tennis and volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56.

Therefore, there are 56 students in total.

56"
"To calculate the total profit, we first need to find the total number of lollipops sold. Since there are 30 students and each student sold 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is 30 * 10 = 300.

The cost of each lollipop is $0.5, so the total cost of the lollipops is 300 * $0.5 = $150.

The selling price of each lollipop is $0.8, so the total revenue from selling 300 lollipops is 300 * $0.8 = $240.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost, which is $240 - $150 = $90.

Therefore, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

90"
"To determine the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet he has.

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 1/3 * 21 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets Larry has: 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets.

The total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"To determine how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total daily consumption of both Abby and Josh. 

Abby eats 2 slices a day, and Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices a day. 

The total daily consumption is 2 (Abby) + 4 (Josh) = 6 slices a day.

Since the loaf has 24 slices, we can divide 24 by 6 to find out how many days it will last: 24 / 6 = 4 days.

The loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"To find the total number of shells Martha has collected, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and now she is 10 years old, the number of months she has been collecting shells is 10 - 5 = 5 years.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the number of years by 12 to get the total number of months: 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

Since Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she has collected is equal to the number of months she has been collecting shells: 60 months.

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of cups of tea that Lana brews in each row. Since she has 27 cups in total and brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea, the remaining cups are used for chamomile and mint tea. 

The number of cups for chamomile and mint tea is 27 - 15 = 12 cups. Since she divides these into 3 rows, each row will have an equal number of cups. 

To find the number of cups in each row, we divide the total number of cups for chamomile and mint tea by 3. 

12 cups / 3 rows = 4 cups per row.

Since the problem states that she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of cups of mint tea in each row will also be 4.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours. Since it takes 4 hours for the sloth to make a round trip, we can divide 8 hours by 4 hours to find the number of round trips.

8 hours / 4 hours per round trip = 2 round trips

Since the sloth makes a round trip (down and back up), we need to multiply the number of round trips by 2 to find the total number of trips.

2 round trips * 2 trips per round trip = 4 trips

Now, we need to find the minimum number of berries the sloth can pick per trip. We know that the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in total. To find the minimum number of berries per trip, we can divide the total number of berries by the total number of trips.

24 berries / 4 trips = 6 berries per trip

Therefore, the sloth needs to pick at least 6 berries per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in the tank after 6 days. 

Initially, the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, which is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Since the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, after 6 days, the amount of water in the tank will be:

5000 - (500 * 6) = 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

The remaining water in the tank after 6 days is 2000 gallons.

2000"
"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying popcorn and candy.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He has already spent $8 on popcorn and $8 on candy, so he has $150 - $8 - $8 = $134 left.

Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10. We need to find out how many $10 tickets Colby can buy with $134. 

$134 / $10 = 13.4

Since Colby can't buy a fraction of a ticket, he can buy 13 tickets. 

Now, we need to subtract the cost of the tickets from Colby's remaining money. 

13 * $10 = $130

$134 - $130 = $4

Colby has $4 left. Since tickets for other days cost $7, he can buy 4 / $7 = 0.57 tickets. However, he can't buy a fraction of a ticket, so he can buy 0 tickets on other days.

Therefore, Colby can see 13 movies.

"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, which is 600 / 3 = 200 calories. Since Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, the total calories from cinnamon rolls are 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, which is 450 / 3 = 150 calories. Since Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, the total calories from blueberry muffins are 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

The total calories from all pastries are the sum of the calories from cinnamon rolls and blueberry muffins, which is 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removed per day, we need to first calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, which is 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total number of Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 222

There are 5 days in total. To find the average, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days:

Average = Total number of Junebugs / Number of days
Average = 222 / 5
Average = 44.4

The final answer is 44.4."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus traveled at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it covered is 60 * 5 = 300 miles.

The car traveled at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it covered is 30 * 8 = 240 miles.

To find the difference in distance, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus: 300 - 240 = 60 miles.

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find the number of bouncy balls in the tube, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie already had from the total number of toys she now has. 

First, let's add up the number of toys she already had: 
- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9
Total toys initially: 31 + 8 + 9 = 48

Now, let's subtract the total number of toys she initially had from the total number of toys she now has: 
Total toys now: 62
Initial toys: 48
Number of bouncy balls: 62 - 48 = 14

The number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as A, and Jean's age as J.

We are given the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: P + A + J = 100
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: A = J + 10
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: P = A + J

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to get: P = (J + 10) + J
Simplifying, we get: P = 2J + 10

Now, we can substitute the expression for P into the first equation: (2J + 10) + A + J = 100
Substituting A = J + 10, we get: (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms: 4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides: 4J = 80
Divide by 4: J = 20

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age: A = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
And finally, we can find Peter's age: P = A + J = 30 + 20 = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of balloons each person initially had and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, each of Maria's 4 friends had 2 water balloons, so they had a total of 4 x 2 = 8 balloons. Maria had 1 balloon for herself, so the total number of balloons initially was 8 + 1 = 9.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (4 friends + Maria), the total number of additional balloons given is 5 x 3 = 15.

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons: 9 + 15 = 24.

Therefore, the total number of balloons the girls had is 24.

"To determine the total number of boxes of stuff, we need to calculate the total number of boxes donated and the existing boxes.

Donated boxes: 10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes
Existing boxes: 10 boxes

Total boxes: 50 boxes + 10 boxes = 60 boxes

Since each table can hold 2 boxes, we divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find the total number of tables needed.

Total tables needed: 60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

Since they already have 15 tables, we subtract the existing tables from the total tables needed to find the number of new tables required.

New tables needed: 30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables

The charity group needs 15 new tables."
"To find the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance each person spat and then find the average.

Zoey spits 40 seeds, each 10 feet, so the total distance she spat is 40 * 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney spits 35 seeds, each 12 feet, so the total distance she spat is 35 * 12 = 420 feet.

To find the average total distance spat, we add the total distances and divide by the number of seeds each person spat.

Average total distance spat = (Zoey's total distance + Sydney's total distance) / (Zoey's seeds + Sydney's seeds)
= (400 + 420) / (40 + 35)
= 820 / 75
= 10.93 feet

The average total distance spat is approximately 10.93 feet."
"To determine the difference in earnings between the two machines, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month and then multiply that by the selling price of each widget.

The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour and runs for 24 hours a day. In a month with 30 days, it will produce:
60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets

The WidgetMaster 9000 produces 45 widgets per hour and runs for 24 hours a day. In a month with 30 days, it will produce:
45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Since each widget sells for $6, the total earnings from the Widgeteer 3000 will be:
43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

The total earnings from the WidgetMaster 9000 will be:
32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $192,000

The difference in earnings between the two machines is:
$259,200 - $192,000 = $67,200

Therefore, Fern will make $67,200 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000 in a month."
"To determine how much Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour option, we first need to calculate the cost of the 12-hour stay and the cost of the 24-hour stay.

For the 12-hour stay, Cameron would pay 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours. Since he wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, he would stay for 5 hours after the 12-hour mark. The additional 5 hours would cost 5 * 70 = 350 pesos. Therefore, the total cost for the 12-hour stay would be 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

For the 24-hour stay, Cameron would pay 1600 pesos for the entire 24 hours.

To find out how much Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour option, we subtract the cost of the 12-hour stay from the cost of the 24-hour stay: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

Therefore, Cameron would save 250 pesos by choosing the 12-hour option.

"To determine the total amount of hay needed, we first need to calculate the amount each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Sheep's hay = 2 * Goat's hay - 3
Sheep's hay = 2 * 5 - 3
Sheep's hay = 10 - 3
Sheep's hay = 7

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

Total hay for goats = Number of goats * Goat's hay
Total hay for goats = 15 * 5
Total hay for goats = 75

Total hay for sheep = Number of sheep * Sheep's hay
Total hay for sheep = 12 * 7
Total hay for sheep = 84

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed by adding the hay for goats and sheep:

Total hay needed = Total hay for goats + Total hay for sheep
Total hay needed = 75 + 84
Total hay needed = 159

The final answer is: 159"

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the ages of Marcus, Leo, and Deanna. 

We know that Deanna is 26 years old. Since Marcus is half of Leo's age, we can represent Marcus's age as x and Leo's age as 2x. 

We also know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so we can set up the equation: x = 26 - 5.

Solving for x, we get x = 21. 

Since Leo's age is twice Marcus's age, Leo's age is 2x = 2 * 21 = 42.

Since each paper is printed on both sides, there are 2 pages per inch. 

Given that the book is 1.5 inches thick, we can multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book to get the total number of pages:

2 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 3 pages

Therefore, the book contains 3 pages."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of minutes Vince worked. 

First, we find the total minutes from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM. 
11:00 PM - 8:00 AM = 15 hours
15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we divide the total minutes by the time it takes Vince to staple 30 reports (15 minutes) to find the total number of sets of 30 reports he stapled.
900 minutes / 15 minutes/set = 60 sets

Since each set contains 30 reports, we multiply the number of sets by 30 to find the total number of reports.
60 sets * 30 reports/set = 1800 reports

The final answer is: 1800"
"To determine the total minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she spent outside of bed.

Kim's usual sleep duration is 8 hours (from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.). However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom, so her usual wake-up time is 6:05 a.m. 

Since she woke up at 2:15 a.m. that day, we need to calculate the time she was asleep from 2:15 a.m. to 6:05 a.m.

First, let's convert 6:05 a.m. to minutes: 6 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 5 minutes = 365 minutes.

Now, let's convert 2:15 a.m. to minutes: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 15 minutes = 135 minutes.

Now, subtract the time she woke up from the time she went to bed: 365 minutes - 135 minutes = 230 minutes.

However, we also need to account for the time she was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. Since she was asleep during this time, we need to add it to the total time: 230 minutes + 23 minutes = 253 minutes.

Therefore, Kim slept for 253 minutes on her bed that day.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan initially has. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

Two dozen cups = 2 * 12 = 24 cups
Number of measuring spoons = 2/3 * 24 = 16

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with:

16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons

Jonathan still has 24 measuring cups. Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

24 measuring cups + 10 measuring spoons = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the total number of unoccupied beds, we first need to determine the initial number of occupied beds and then calculate the number of beds that become unoccupied over the 2-week period.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 are occupied. 

Initial number of occupied beds = 1000 * (1/5) = 200 beds

Initial number of unoccupied beds = 1000 - 200 = 800 beds

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the number of occupied beds increases by 50 each day. 

Number of days in 2 weeks = 14 days

Total increase in occupied beds = 50 * 14 = 700 beds

New number of occupied beds = 200 + 700 = 900 beds

Number of unoccupied beds = 1000 - 900 = 100 beds

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we first need to determine the total number of non-work emails she sends. 

She sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the non-work emails are to her family, which means she sends 2/3 * 9 = 6 emails to her family.

The remaining non-work emails are to her boyfriend. Since 6 emails are to her family, the number of emails to her boyfriend is 9 - 6 = 3.

Therefore, Robyn sends 3 emails a day to her boyfriend.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the ages of Shawna and her father, and Aliya.

We know that Aliya is 3 years old. Since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, Shawna's age can be calculated as 3 * 3 = 9 years.

Now, we know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. Therefore, Shawna's father's age can be calculated as 5 * 9 = 45 years.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from Courtney's number.

First, let's find 20% of 48: 
20% of 48 = 0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from Courtney's number:
48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

38.4"
"To solve this problem, we can use the information given to establish a relationship between the number of balls each boy picked up. 

Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, and Jason carried 2 balls, we can determine that Jeffrey carried half the number of balls Jason did. Therefore, Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each: 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7.

Therefore, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is 7.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day. 

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 31 holes.

Since the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, we can set up the equation 4 * 31 = total holes at the end of the fourth day. 

4 * 31 = 124 holes.

Now, we need to find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day. We know that the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 124, and the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 31. 

So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 124 - 31 = 93 holes.

The final answer is: 93"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many corn chips Collins received. Since Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, and Collins got 15 more than the number the others got, Collins must have received 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, we can find the total number of corn chips by adding the amount each person received. 

70 (Amora) + 70 (Lainey) + 85 (Collins) = 225

The total number of corn chips is 225."
"To find the cost of the travel, we need to calculate 50% of the cost of the supplies and add it to the cost of the supplies. 

50% of $400 is 0.5 * 400 = $200. 

The total cost of the travel is the cost of the supplies plus 50% of the cost of the supplies, which is $400 + $200 = $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of Pokémon caught is 339: A + S + X = 339
2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan: X = S + 5
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe: S = 4A - 13

We can substitute the expression for X from the second equation into the first equation:
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
Combine like terms:
A + 2S + 5 = 339

Now, substitute the expression for S from the third equation into the previous equation:
A + 2(4A - 13) + 5 = 339
Expand and simplify:
A + 8A - 26 + 5 = 339
Combine like terms:
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide both sides by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

Therefore, Stan has caught 147 Pokémon.

"To find the total number of episodes, we need to divide the total minutes per episode by 2, since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. 

Total minutes per episode = 20 minutes
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the total number of episodes by the length of each episode.

Total time = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time = 10 * 20
Total time = 200 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the bird in each direction and then find the difference between the distances traveled in the southerly and northerly directions.

The bird travels 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the southerly direction is 10 * 30 = 300 miles.

The bird then travels 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the northerly direction is 2 * 18 = 36 miles.

The bird then travels 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the southerly direction is 5 * 22 = 110 miles.

However, since the bird is traveling in the southerly direction for the first 300 miles and then travels 36 miles north, we need to subtract the 36 miles from the 300 miles to find the net distance traveled in the southerly direction. 

300 - 36 = 264 miles.

The bird then travels 110 miles south, so the total distance traveled in the southerly direction is 264 + 110 = 374 miles.

Since the bird travels 374 miles in the southerly direction, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles.

The final answer is: 374"
"To find the total number of brownies Greta had, we need to calculate the number of brownies she received and subtract the number eaten.

She initially made 1 dozen (12) brownies for herself. Then, she received 1/2 a dozen (6) from her office party and 4 dozen (48) from her friends. 

Total brownies received = 12 + 6 + 48 = 66

During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten. 

Total brownies eaten = 18

To find the number of brownies left over, we subtract the total eaten from the total received:

Total brownies left over = Total brownies received - Total brownies eaten
= 66 - 18
= 48

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total age of the family members, we need to calculate the age of each member and then add them together.

Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so his brother is 8 * 2 = 16 years old.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6 years old.

Now, we add the ages of all three family members: 8 (Nani) + 16 (brother) + 6 (sister) = 30 years.

The total age of the family members is 30 years."
"To determine the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time it takes to string each type of racquet and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to string each type of racquet:
- Synthetic gut: 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes
- Polyester string: 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes
- Hybrid set: 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

Now, let's add the time it takes to string each type of racquet together:
45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes

Therefore, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all 12 racquets.

"To calculate the total cost, we need to consider the price of the first two phones and the discounted price of the remaining phones.

The first two phones cost $600 each, so the total cost for these two phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.

The remaining phones are 3 in total (John and his 2 kids), and each one is half the price of the first two phones, which is $300. So, the total cost for the remaining phones is 3 * $300 = $900.

Now, we add the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones: $1200 + $900 = $2100.

Therefore, John paid $2100 for all the phones.

"To find the total number of players in both teams, we need to add the number of players in Zeke's team to the number of players in Carlton's team. 

Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, we can represent the number of players in Zeke's team as 13 + 7 = 20.

Now, we add the number of players in both teams: 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33.

The total number of players in both teams is 33.

"To determine the number of wooden slats needed, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular garden. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the garden, and it can be calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides.

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

Given that the length (l) is 15 feet and the width (w) is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(15) + 2(10)
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

Number of slats = 2 * P
= 2 * 50
= 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges. Each box contains 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges she bought is 12 * 20 = 240.

She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each, which is a total of 2 * 2 = 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, she gave away 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

Now, she has 240 - 80 = 160 oranges left.

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 160 = 40 oranges.

So, the number of oranges she sold is 160 - 40 = 120.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of states in the USA. The USA has 50 states. 

Since India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we can calculate half of the number of states in the USA by dividing 50 by 2, which equals 25. Then, we add 4 to this result to find the number of states in India, which equals 29.

Now, we can find the total number of states in both countries by adding the number of states in the USA and India. 50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79.

"To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy. 

The total cost of the items is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has saved $14, he still needs $39 - $14 = $25 to afford the books.

Given that Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can calculate the number of hours he needs to work by dividing the amount he still needs ($25) by his hourly wage ($5).

$25 ÷ $5 = 5 hours.

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 30 cherries and 10 more than Richard, we can set up an equation to find Richard's share. 

Let's denote Richard's share as 'x'. Then, Robert's share is 'x + 10'. We know that the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert has 30 cherries. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 10) = 60

Combine like terms:

2x + 10 = 60

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x = 50

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 25

So, Richard has 25 cherries. 

Now, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting Richard's share from the total number of cherries:

60 - 25 = 35

Jerry has 35 cherries.

To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract Jerry's share from Robert's share:

30 - 35 = -5

However, since we can't have a negative number of cherries, this indicates that Robert actually has fewer cherries than Jerry."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of boxes sold on each day and then multiply it by the respective cost of each item.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. Since he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread on Sunday, he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday. 

So, on Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie.

On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of gingerbread and 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each day:

- Saturday: (10 * $6) + (11 * $15) = $60 + $165 = $225
- Sunday: (15 * $6) + (15 * $15) = $90 + $225 = $315

Total earnings for two days: $225 + $315 = $540

"To determine the number of bottles of sunscreen Pamela needs to pack, we need to calculate the total amount of time she will be outside. 

She will be outside for 4 hours a day for 8 days, so the total time is 4 hours/day * 8 days = 32 hours.

Since she reappplies sunscreen every hour, she will need 32 hours * 1 ounce/hour = 32 ounces of sunscreen.

Each bottle of sunscreen contains 8 ounces, so the number of bottles she needs is 32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles.

So, the blue car costs $100 and the red car costs $60.

The final answer is: $100, $60."
"To solve this problem, let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

We are given the following information:

1. Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = D/2.
3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B.

From the first equation, we can find D: D = 24 * 2 = 48.

From the second equation, we can find B: B = 24 / 2 = 12.

Now, we have the current ages of Emil, his dad, and his brother: E = 19, D = 48, and B = 12.

The sum of their ages is E + D + B = 19 + 48 + 12 = 79.

"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads each person gave her and then add them together.

Her mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day and add them together.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the amounts together: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings: 21 / 3 = 7.

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size five boots, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

To find the average size, we add the sizes of both pairs and divide by 2. 

Average size = (5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

The average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15."
"To determine the total cost of the flowers, we first need to calculate the total space required for the flowers and the space left between them. 

Since Pat's flower bed is 111 feet long, we need to convert this to inches for consistency. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 111 feet is equal to 111 * 12 = 1332 inches.

Each flower is 12 inches wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (18 inches) between each flower. This means that the total space required for each flower and the space between it and the next flower is 18 inches. 

To find out how many 18-inch spaces can fit in the 1332-inch flower bed, we divide 1332 by 18. This gives us 74.67, which we round down to 74 since we can't have a fraction of a space.

Since Pat already owns 17 flowers, we need to calculate the number of additional flowers she needs to buy. We subtract the number of flowers she already owns from the total number of spaces available: 74 - 17 = 57.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the flowers. Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be 57 flowers * $6 per flower = $342.

The final answer is: $342"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we first need to determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, we can calculate this by multiplying Edgar's daily pretzel consumption by 1/2.

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, so his brother eats 18 * 1/2 = 9 pretzels a day.

To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply his daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week).

9 pretzels/day * 7 days = 63 pretzels/week.

The cost of sweet potato vines: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00

The total cost is the sum of the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines: $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

The final answer is: $70."
"To determine the number of roses they can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used by the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds each = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds each = 15 pounds

Total soil used by sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds

Since they have 30 pounds of soil, the remaining amount for roses is:
30 - 27 = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound, they can plant 3 roses.

"To determine how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate how much she sets aside for shoes each month and then divide that amount by the cost of a single pair of shoes.

Jessica sets aside 25% of her monthly income, which is 0.25 * $2,000 = $500. 

Since there are 12 months in a year, she sets aside $500 * 12 = $6,000 for shoes annually.

Now, we divide the total amount set aside for shoes ($6,000) by the cost of a single pair of shoes ($1,000) to find out how many shoes she can buy in a year: $6,000 / $1,000 = 6.

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two steps: peeling and cooking. 

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. Since Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute, we can divide 90 by 6 to find the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp: 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp. We know that Emily can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp, we can divide 90 by 30 and then multiply by 10: (90 / 30) * 10 = 30 minutes.

Since peeling and cooking are done sequentially, we need to add the time it takes to peel and cook the shrimp. Therefore, the total time it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 15 + 30 = 45 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net cooling effect of the air conditioner. 

First, let's calculate the cooling effect of the air conditioner on low. Since it cools the room by 2 degrees per hour, in 3 hours, it cools the room by 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

Next, let's calculate the cooling effect of the air conditioner on high. Since it cools the room by 3 degrees per hour, in 4 hours, it cools the room by 3 * 4 = 12 degrees.

Since the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, the room will warm up by 2 degrees per hour, so it will warm up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the net cooling effect. The air conditioner cooled the room by 6 + 12 = 18 degrees initially. However, the room warmed up by 4 degrees, so the net cooling effect is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as 'x'. 

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old, and Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times his father's age at that time, we can set up the following equation:

3 * (30) = x + 75

This is because the time elapsed between the two sightings is 75 years. 

Simplifying the equation, we get:

90 = x + 75

Subtracting 75 from both sides, we get:

15 = x

Therefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

3. Checks to the church: 2 checks per month
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 4 checks per year (since there are 3 quarters in a year)

Now, let's calculate the total number of checks per month:
1 (electric) + 1 (gas) + 2 (church) = 4 checks per month

Since there are 4 checks per month, and 12 months in a year, the total number of checks per year is:
4 checks/month * 12 months/year = 48 checks/year

Buford writes 48 checks per year."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of flights made by the first plane in a day. 

Since the second plane makes 44 trips and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes, the first plane must make 44 * 2 = 88 trips in a day.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so it goes to Greece for 88 * 3/4 = 66 flights.

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. This means the first plane makes 88 - 66 = 22 flights to either France or Germany.

Since the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the first plane makes 22 / 2 = 11 flights to France in a day.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we need to convert the total duration from seconds to minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we divide the total duration by 60.

Total duration in minutes = (20 + 40 + 60) / 60 = 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"To determine how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the total cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is 2 * $6 = $12. The total amount of money he received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

The total cost of the trousers is $30. To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the total cost of the trousers: $30 - $18 = $12.

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Let's denote the age of Helene as H, the age of Alessandro as A, the age of Akbar as K, and the age of Wilfred as W. We are given that K = 3 and A = 4.

2. We are also given that Helene is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is (H + A + K + W) / 4. Since Helene is twice the average age, we can write the equation: H = 2 * ((H + A + K + W) / 4).

3. We are also given that the total age of the children is 20. This can be written as: H + A + K + W = 20.

4. We can substitute the values of A and K into the equation from step 2: H = 2 * ((H + 4 + 3 + W) / 4).

5. Simplify the equation: H = (H + 7 + W) / 2.

6. Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 2H = H + 7 + W.

7. Subtract H from both sides: H = 7 + W.

8. Now we have two equations: H = 7 + W and H + A + K + W = 20. We can substitute H from the first equation into the second equation: (7 + W) + 4 + 3 + W = 20.

9. Combine like terms: 14 + 2W = 20.

10. Subtract 14 from both sides: 2W = 6.

11. Divide both sides by 2: W = 3.

The final answer is 3."
"To determine the amount Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to calculate the total amount of money Walter has collected so far. 

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, we need to find out how much his lawyer will contribute based on this amount.

However, the problem statement does not specify that Walter's lawyer will contribute based on the total amount collected by Walter. Instead, it states that Walter will tell his lawyer about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200. This implies that Walter's lawyer's contribution is not directly related to the amount collected by Walter, but rather to the amount Walter's friend gives him.

Since Walter's friend gives him $200, we can assume that Walter's lawyer's contribution is also $200. 

The final answer is: $200"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of cookies available. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is 1/2 * 1500 = 750.

Since each person in the church received 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received. 

Number of people in the church = 750 / 15 = 50.

The final answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the total number of slices and the ratio of adult to kid slices. 

Let's assume the total number of slices is x. Since each adult gets a slice twice as big as each kid, we can represent the number of slices for each adult as 2y and for each kid as y.

We know that the total number of slices is the sum of the slices for the adults and the kids, so we can write the equation:

2 adults * 2y + 4 kids * y = x

This simplifies to:

4y + 4y = x
8y = x

Now, we need to find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. Since each adult gets 2y slices, and the total number of slices is 8y, we can find the fraction of the watermelon each adult gets:

Fraction = (2y / 8y) = 1/4

To convert this fraction to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

Percentage = (1/4) * 100 = 25%

Therefore, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To determine the total time spent on inpatients, we need to multiply the number of inpatients by the time spent per inpatient. 

9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time spent on inpatients to hours by dividing by 60.

180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

Now, let's calculate the total time spent on appointments. 

10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes

Again, we convert the total time spent on appointments to hours.

300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours

Now, we add the time spent on inpatients and appointments to find the total time spent.

3 hours (inpatients) + 5 hours (appointments) = 8 hours

Since Doctor Jones is spending 9 hours at the clinic, we subtract the total time spent from the total time available.

9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

Therefore, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake.

The total time required is the sum of the time to make the batter, bake the cake, cool the cake, and frost the cake. 

Time to make the batter = 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake = 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake = 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake = 10 minutes

Total time required = 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes: 
180 minutes = 3 hours

To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to subtract the total time from the desired serving time. 
Desired serving time = 5:00 pm
Total time = 3 hours

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, Jordan should start making the cake by 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of boxes sold by both Lisa and Peter, and then divide the total number of chocolate bars sold by that number.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars.
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars.

Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars.

We know that they sold 64 chocolate bars together, so we can set up the equation:

8x = 64

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8:

x = 64 / 8
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to first calculate the weekly earnings and then multiply it by 4.

The cost to rent the studio per session is $25, and there are 3 sessions per week. So, the weekly cost to rent the studio is $25 * 3 = $75.

The cost to rent the studio per student per session is $1.50, and there are 10 students. So, the weekly cost to rent the students is $1.50 * 10 = $15.

The total weekly cost is the sum of the cost to rent the studio and the cost to rent the students, which is $75 + $15 = $90.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total monthly cost is $90 * 4 = $360.

The dance studio earns $25 per session, and there are 3 sessions per week. So, the weekly earnings are $25 * 3 = $75.

The total monthly earnings are $75 * 4 = $300.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is the difference between the total monthly cost and the total monthly earnings, which is $360 - $300 = $60.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many chocolate bars are in each box. 

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each box as 'x'. 

Since Peter has 4 boxes, the total number of chocolate bars he has is 4x. 

Similarly, Martha has 7 boxes, so the total number of chocolate bars she has is 7x.

We are given that Peter has 64 chocolate bars and Martha has 56 chocolate bars. 

We can set up the following equations:

4x = 64
7x = 56

Solving for x, we get:
x = 64 / 4 = 16
x = 56 / 7 = 8

Since x = 16, we can see that Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box. 

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract Martha's number of chocolate bars per box from Peter's number of chocolate bars per box:

16 - 8 = 8

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

"To determine the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population. 

3/5 * 50 = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, we need to calculate the total number of babies born in a year. 

There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of babies born is 4 * 12 = 48.

Now, we need to add the initial number of female porcupines to the total number of babies born. 

30 (initial female porcupines) + 48 (babies) = 78

So, the total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be 78.

"To calculate the volume of the pool, we need to multiply its length, width, and depth. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as a swimming pool) is V = length * width * height. 

Given the dimensions of the pool, we can calculate its volume as follows: 
V = 14 * 25 * 4 = 1400 cubic feet.

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the total gallons of water needed, we multiply 1400 by 5.9:
1400 * 5.9 = 8260 gallons.

Now, to find the cost of filling the pool, we multiply the total gallons by the cost per gallon, which is $0.10:
8260 * 0.10 = $826.

The cost to fill the pool is $826."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of blue sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, and there are 9 red sticks, we can calculate the number of blue sticks as follows:

Number of blue sticks = Number of red sticks + 5
Number of blue sticks = 9 + 5
Number of blue sticks = 14

Next, we are told that the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks. So, we can calculate the number of yellow sticks as follows:

Number of yellow sticks = Number of blue sticks - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 14 - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 11

Now, we have the number of red sticks (9), blue sticks (14), and yellow sticks (11). To find the total number of sticks, we simply add these numbers together:

Total number of sticks = Number of red sticks + Number of blue sticks + Number of yellow sticks
Total number of sticks = 9 + 14 + 11
Total number of sticks = 34

The total number of sticks is 34."
"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to calculate the distance each of them traveled.

Matteo's distance = speed * time = 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles

Shandy's distance = speed * time = 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles

The difference in distance = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

"To find the number of female students, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old. Since there are 3000 students in total, half of them would be 3000 / 2 = 1500 students over 16 years old.

We are also told that one-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male. So, the number of male students over 16 years old would be 1500 / 4 = 375.

Now, we know that the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old. This means the other half of the students are 1500 / 2 = 750 students under 16 years old.

We are told that one-half of the students under 16 are male. So, the number of male students under 16 years old would be 750 / 2 = 375.

To find the number of female students under 16 years old, we subtract the number of male students under 16 from the total number of students under 16: 750 - 375 = 375.

Now, we can find the total number of female students by adding the number of female students over 16 and under 16. The number of female students over 16 years old is 1500 - 375 = 1125. Adding this to the number of female students under 16 years old, we get 1125 + 375 = 1500.

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at the school is 1500.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of laps each person can run and then compare them.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on each day.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons. The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped over the two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the amount of water remaining for the tank to be full is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we can break it down into two parts: the first part where the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour, and the second part where it loses 7% of its capacity per hour.

Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as x. 

In the first part, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour for 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the charge remaining is (1 - 0.09)^5 * x.

In the second part, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity per hour for 3 hours. This means that after 3 hours, the charge remaining is (1 - 0.07)^3 * (1 - 0.09)^5 * x.

We are given that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 28%. So, we can set up the equation:

(1 - 0.09)^5 * x * (1 - 0.07)^3 = 0.28

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(0.91)^5 * x * (0.93)^3 = 0.28

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 0.28 / ((0.91)^5 * (0.93)^3)

x ≈ 0.28 / 0.576
x ≈ 0.488

So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 48.8%.

"To determine the total amount Janet needs to save for the down payment, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings. 

Her wages per week are $10/hour * 40 hours/week = $400/week. 

Her tips per week are $15/hour * 40 hours/week = $600/week. 

Her total weekly earnings are $400/week + $600/week = $1000/week. 

The down payment is 20% of $10,000, which is 0.2 * $10,000 = $2,000. 

To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save $2,000, we divide the amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings: $2,000 / $1000/week = 2 weeks."
"To determine how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has spent on other fruits.

The cost of kiwis is 2 * $1 = $2
The cost of apples is 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

The total amount spent on other fruits is $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums he can buy is $0.75 / $0.25 = 3.

"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we first need to determine the total number of sweets in the box. 

There are 15 packs in the box, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, the total number of sweets is 15 * 60 = 900.

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, which means she kept 2 * 60 = 120 pieces.

Now, we subtract the number of sweets Anne kept from the total number of sweets to find out how many sweets were given to her friends: 900 - 120 = 780.

Since Anne gave the sweets equally to her 10 friends, we divide the remaining sweets by 10: 780 / 10 = 78.

Therefore, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

"To calculate the price of carrots after three years, we need to apply the 5% annual increase to the initial price of $120 for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial price = $120
Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Initial price = $126
Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Initial price = $132.30
Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Since 3 albums were selfies only, and each album has 9 pictures, the number of selfies is 3 * 9 = 27.

The remaining albums are portraits, and there are 8 - 3 = 5 portraits. Since each portrait album has 9 pictures, the number of portraits is 5 * 9 = 45.

Therefore, Olivia had 45 portraits and 27 selfies.

Since James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, we can find the time it takes him to read 1 page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages. 

10 minutes / 3 pages = 3.33 minutes per page

Now, we can multiply the time it takes to read 1 page by the total number of pages he read (18 pages). 

3.33 minutes per page * 18 pages = 60 minutes

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.

24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests remaining is 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, so the number of guests remaining is 76 - 15 = 61.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 people opted for a late checkout, 2 * 15 = 30 people checked in.

Now, the total number of guests is 61 (remaining from the initial number) + 30 (new arrivals) = 91.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as 'x'. Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2x.

The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal. Since each small stuffed animal costs $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total earnings from the sales can be calculated by multiplying the number of each type of stuffed animal sold by its price and adding the results. The equation for the total earnings is:

Total earnings = (Number of large stuffed animals * Price of a large stuffed animal) + (Number of small stuffed animals * Price of a small stuffed animal)
Total earnings = (x * $12) + (2x * $4)
Total earnings = $12x + $8x
Total earnings = $20x

We are given that the total earnings are $120. So, we can set up the equation:

$20x = $120

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by $20:

x = $120 / $20
x = 6

Since x represents the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2x, which is:

2x = 2 * 6
2x = 12

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

Total sandwiches per week = 11 sandwiches per day * 7 days = 77 sandwiches.

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings first. 

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 * $1 = $80.
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 * $4 = $240.

Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave away a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

Now, we subtract the amount she gave away from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

Therefore, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the amount of ore that 40 dwarves can mine with steel pickaxes in a day.

Since one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, 40 dwarves can mine 40 * 12 = 480 pounds of ore per day.

Since the problem states that 40 dwarves can mine 50% more ore with steel pickaxes than with iron pickaxes, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine with iron pickaxes in a day. 

Let's denote the amount of ore that one dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe as x. Then, 40 dwarves can mine 40x pounds of ore per day.

Since 40 dwarves can mine 50% more ore with steel pickaxes than with iron pickaxes, we can set up the equation:

40x + 50% of 40x = 480

Simplifying the equation, we get:

40x + 20x = 480

Combine like terms:

60x = 480

Divide both sides by 60:

x = 8

So, one dwarf can mine 8 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe.

Now, we know that 40 dwarves can mine 40 * 8 = 320 pounds of ore per day with iron pickaxes.

Since 40 dwarves can mine 50% more ore with steel pickaxes than with iron pickaxes, we can calculate the amount of ore that 40 dwarves can mine with steel pickaxes in a day:

40 * 1.5 * 8 = 480 pounds of ore per day

Since there are 30 days in a month, we multiply the daily amount by 30:

480 * 30 = 14400 pounds of ore per month

The final answer is: 14400"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of proportionality. Let's denote the price of the package with 8 sandwiches as x. 

Since the prices are proportional, we can set up a proportion based on the ratio of the number of sandwiches to the price. 

We know that the ratio of sandwiches to price for the first package is 2:3, and for the second package is 4:6. 

We can set up the proportion as follows: 
2/3 = 4/6 = 8/x

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 
2x = 4 * 3 
2x = 12 
x = 12/2 
x = 6

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $6.

"To determine the monthly payment, we first need to calculate the remaining amount Tom owes after using the $1000 he received from selling his old bedroom. 

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount received from selling the old bedroom: $1000
Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we can calculate the monthly payment as follows:

Monthly payment = 10% of $2000
Monthly payment = 0.10 * $2000
Monthly payment = $200

The final answer is: $200"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of balloons Sally had after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 40% of 25 is 0.4 * 25 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving Sally with 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Then, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 12 / 2 = 6. So, she released 6 yellow balloons, leaving her with 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Next, she found 8 blue balloons in the tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

Now, let's count the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school: 
- Red balloons: 15
- Green balloons: 7
- Yellow balloons: 6
- Blue balloons: 6

Total number of balloons = 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the different scenarios in which Marcus will have to turn in his homework. 

First, let's consider the case where the normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension. The probability of this happening is 1 - 0.4 = 0.6 (since there's a 40% chance of an extension). In this case, Marcus will definitely have to turn in his homework. 

Next, let's consider the case where the substitute teacher comes in. The probability of this happening is 0.5 (since there's a 50% chance of a substitute teacher). If the substitute teacher comes in, Marcus will definitely have to turn in his homework.

Now, let's consider the case where the normal teacher comes in and gives an extension. The probability of this happening is 0.4. In this case, Marcus won't have to turn in his homework.

Finally, let's consider the case where the normal teacher comes in but Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment. The probability of this happening is 0.6 * 0.2 = 0.12 (since the probability of the normal teacher coming in is 0.6 and the probability of Marcus convincing her is 0.2). In this case, Marcus won't have to turn in his homework.

Now, we can add up the probabilities of the scenarios in which Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 0.4 (normal teacher gives an extension) + 0.5 * 0.2 (substitute teacher comes in) = 0.6. 

Since the sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes must be 1, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 1 - 0.6 = 0.4.

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 40%.

The final answer is: 40%"
"To determine the number of tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family, we need to first calculate the total number of available tickets. 

Total available seats = 6000
Seats for graduates = 950
Seats for faculty = 300

Total available tickets = Total available seats - (Seats for graduates + Seats for faculty)
Total available tickets = 6000 - (950 + 300)
Total available tickets = 6000 - 1250
Total available tickets = 4750

Since the tickets are split equally among the graduates, we need to divide the total available tickets by the number of graduates.

Number of graduates = 950

Tickets per graduate = Total available tickets / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the different sizes of jelly beans. 

First, we know that it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, we can calculate the number of medium-sized beans as 2 * 75 = 150.

Now, we are given that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean. This means that the number of small beans is 3 times the number of medium-sized beans. 

So, the number of small beans is 3 * 150 = 450.

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly beans.

450"
"To determine Melissa's hourly wage after expenses, we need to calculate her total earnings and then subtract her expenses.

First, let's calculate her total earnings:
Total earnings = Daily earnings * Number of days
Total earnings = $15/day * 3 days
Total earnings = $45

Next, let's calculate her total expenses:
Total expenses = Daily expenses * Number of days
Total expenses = $3/day * 3 days
Total expenses = $9

Now, let's calculate her net earnings (hourly wage after expenses):
Net earnings = Total earnings - Total expenses
Net earnings = $45 - $9
Net earnings = $36

To find her hourly wage, we need to divide her net earnings by the total number of hours she worked:
Hourly wage = Net earnings / Total hours worked
Hourly wage = $36 / 6 hours
Hourly wage = $6

The final answer is 6."
"To find the total amount Ted spent, we need to calculate the cost of the books and pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 books at 16 dollars each is 3 x 16 = 48 dollars.

The cost of 3 pencils at 6 dollars each is 3 x 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the books and pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

Therefore, Ted spent a total of 66 dollars.

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can place along his driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes him to move from one bottle to the next.

The total width of the driveway is 24 feet, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the total width by the spacing between the bottles:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

80 apples / 8 apples per pack = 10 packs.

The final answer is 10."
"To determine how much money Amor will have left to buy meat, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought and subtract it from her initial $50.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 x $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 x $6 = $18.

The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Subtracting the total cost of the cheese from her initial $50, we get $50 - $40 = $10.

Therefore, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school and the total amount of money he earned after graduating.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school. He took 4 years to finish college and got $50,000 in loans per year. So, the total amount of money he lost is:

$50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim earned after graduating. His college degree tripled his income, so his new income is:

$25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year

Since he worked for 4 years after graduating, the total amount of money he earned is:

$75,000/year * 4 years = $300,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay off the loans and the money lost while in school. This is the sum of the total amount of money he lost and the total amount of money he earned after graduating:

$200,000 + $300,000 = $500,000

To find out how long it would take Jim to earn this amount, we can divide the total amount by his new income:

$500,000 / $75,000/year = 6.67 years

So, it would take Jim approximately 6.67 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost while in school.

"To determine the amount of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the area of the comforter. The comforter will be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, so its dimensions will be 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet long and 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet wide.

The area of the comforter is calculated by multiplying its length by its width: 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet.

However, since the comforter is made of two pieces of fabric, we need to double the area to account for both pieces: 80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet.

Therefore, Jim needs 160 square feet of fabric to make the comforter.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then add them together.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Now, let's add the deliveries together: 
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

The total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is 736."
"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

The cost of the chicken salad is 10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.

"To find the average amount Johnny lost, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

In the first race, he lost $5.

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Since he lost $5 in the first race, he won $2 * $5 + $1 = $11 in the second race.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. Since he won $11 in the second race, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.5 in the third race.

Now, let's calculate the total amount he lost: $5 (first race) + $16.5 (third race) = $21.5

To find the average amount he lost, we divide the total amount by the number of races: $21.5 / 3 = $7.17

The average amount Johnny lost that day is $7.17."
"To find the total population of South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then multiply that by the population of each city.

Number of countries in South America = 26

Total population = 130,000

The total population of South America is 130,000."
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their new heights after the growth.

Xavier's new height is his original height plus the growth: 4 feet + 3 inches = 4 feet + 0.25 feet (since 1 foot = 12 inches, 3 inches = 0.25 feet) = 4.25 feet.

Cole's new height is his original height plus the growth: 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches. To convert this to feet, we divide by 12: 52 inches / 12 = 4.33 feet.

Now, we find the difference in their heights: 4.33 feet - 4.25 feet = 0.08 feet.

To convert this to inches, we multiply by 12: 0.08 feet * 12 = 0.96 inches.

The difference in height between Cole and Xavier is 0.96 inches."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the amount the first person took as x. 

Since the second person took $80 more than the first, the second person took x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + 80).

The sum of the amounts taken by all three people is $1920. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 576.67

So, the first person took $576.67.

"To find the total hours of work done by the team, we first need to calculate the total number of days they worked. Since they worked for 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks, we can calculate the total days as follows:

3 weeks = 3 * 7 days = 21 days

Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day, the total hours worked per day is:

3/8 * 24 hours = 9 hours

Now, we can calculate the total hours worked by the team:

Total hours worked = 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours

Since there are 4 painters, we can divide the total hours worked by 4 to find the hours worked by each painter:

Hours worked by each painter = 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours

The final answer is 47.25."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can first multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Expanding the equation:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set, which is x + 4:

6 + 4 = 10

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set of the match.

Since there are 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of movies watched on both days for each week. 

For Saturday: 4 movies/week * 4 weeks = 16 movies
For Sunday: 2 movies/week * 4 weeks = 8 movies

Now, we add the total number of movies watched on both days for each week: 16 + 8 = 24 movies/week

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many slices Jake ate. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, and Becky ate 10 slices, we can set up an equation: 

Let x be the number of slices Jake ate. 
Becky ate x + 3 slices. 
Since Becky ate 10 slices, we can write the equation:

"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to first determine the total cost of the visit itself. 

The visit costs $300/hour, and it lasted for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.

The doctor also charges $6/hour for parking, and the visit lasted for 2 hours. So, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

The total cost of the visit is the sum of the cost of the visit and the cost of parking, which is $150 + $12 = $162.

The cost of the cast is $200, and the cost of the painkillers is $4/pill, but we don't know how many pills were given. However, since the question asks for the total cost of the doctor's visit, we can ignore the cost of the painkillers.

The football team ate 80% of their pizzas, which is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

Now, let's add the number of pizzas eaten by both groups: 14 (glee club) + 32 (football team) = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

To find the number of pizzas left, we subtract the number eaten from the total number ordered: 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

"To determine the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the number of small and big coupons, then multiply each by its respective cost and add them together.

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons, so he will send out 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.

The cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.
The cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

The total cost of postage is 3500 + 21000 = 26200 cents.

To convert this to dollars, we divide by 100: 26200 / 100 = 262 dollars.

The final answer is: 262"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

Then, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, leaving Sidney with 7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches.

Since each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining 3 sub sandwiches is 3 * 4 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of trucks that failed to deliver the fertiliser. Since a quarter of the trucks failed, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of trucks that failed = Total number of trucks * (1/4)
= 20 * (1/4)
= 20 * 0.25
= 5 trucks

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that failed to reach the farmers is:

Total fertiliser that failed to reach = Number of trucks that failed * Tons per truck
= 5 * 20
= 100 tons

Now, we need to find the total number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser. Since 5 trucks failed, the number of trucks that successfully delivered is:

Number of trucks that successfully delivered = Total number of trucks - Number of trucks that failed
= 20 - 5
= 15 trucks

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

Total fertiliser that reached = Number of trucks that successfully delivered * Tons per truck
= 15 * 20
= 300 tons

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300."
"To determine the cost of purchasing 6 pounds of butter, we first need to calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs. Since he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store has a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every two pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds. 

To calculate the cost, we can divide the total amount of butter needed (6 pounds) into two groups of 3 pounds each. For the first 3 pounds, Dennis will pay full price ($4.00 per pound), which is 3 * $4.00 = $12.00. For the second 3 pounds, he will pay half price ($2.00 per pound), which is 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.

The total cost will be the sum of the cost of the two groups: $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00.

The final answer is: $18.00"
"To determine the total cost of the party, we first need to calculate the number of guests. Kayla invited 25 classmates and 7 girls from her dance class, which totals 32 guests. She also invited 13 family members, making the total number of guests 32 + 13 = 45. However, 4 people said they could not come, so the actual number of guests is 45 - 4 = 41.

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. Since there are 41 guests, we need to calculate the number of additional guests beyond the initial 20. This is 41 - 20 = 21.

The total cost will be the initial fee of $125 plus the cost for the additional guests, which is 21 * $6 = $126. Therefore, the total cost of the party is $125 + $126 = $251.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money each of them had initially. 

Since Maggie spent a quarter of her money, and she had $60 left, we can set up the equation: 
M - (1/4)M = 60, where M is the initial amount of money Maggie had.

Solving for M, we get:
(3/4)M = 60
M = 60 * (4/3)
M = 80

So Maggie had $80 initially.

Riza spent one-third of her money, and she had $60 left. We can set up a similar equation for Riza:
R - (1/3)R = 60, where R is the initial amount of money Riza had.

Solving for R, we get:
(2/3)R = 60
R = 60 * (3/2)
R = 90

So Riza had $90 initially.

Now, we can find out how much money they have left:
Maggie's remaining money: 80 - 60 = 20
Riza's remaining money: 90 - 60 = 30

The total amount of money they have left is 20 + 30 = 50.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many bananas each monkey eats per day. 

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. 
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

Since there are three monkeys, and Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, we can calculate the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys per day: 
10 (first monkey) + 14 (second monkey) = 24 bananas per day.

Now, we subtract the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats per day: 
315 (total bananas) - 24 (bananas eaten by first two monkeys) = 291 bananas.

The third monkey eats 291 bananas per day.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed in the given time frame. 

Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle, which means he completed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces.

Then, he started and finished another 500-piece puzzle within an hour. This means he completed 500 pieces in that hour.

To find the total number of pieces Teddy placed in the given hour, we need to add the pieces from both puzzles: 250 + 500 = 750.

Therefore, Teddy placed 750 puzzle pieces during that hour.

750"
"To determine the total cost of the roses, we first need to calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since a dozen roses costs $15, we can calculate the cost of 15 roses as follows:

15 roses = 1.25 dozen roses (15 / 12)
Cost of 15 roses = 1.25 * $15 = $18.75

Jenny has five $5 bills, which is equivalent to $25. To find out how much change she will get, we subtract the cost of the roses from the total amount she has:

$25 - $18.75 = $6.25

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $6.25 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so:

$6.25 = 6 * $1 + 0.25
= 6 * 4 quarters + 1 quarter
= 24 quarters + 1 quarter
= 25 quarters

Jenny will leave with 25 quarters."
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the revenue from each item and add them together.

Revenue from milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50 = $33
Revenue from burger platters: 9 platters * $11 = $99
Revenue from sodas: 20 sodas * $1.50 = $30

Total revenue = $33 + $99 + $30 = $162

The final answer is: 162"
"To determine the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the time elapsed between the first train's arrival and the fourth train's departure.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station after 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station after 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. Since the third train leaves immediately after it arrives, it leaves the station at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Now, we need to calculate the total waiting time for Paul. He waits for the first train to arrive (10 minutes), then waits for the second train to leave (65 minutes), then waits for the third train to leave (125 minutes), and finally waits for the fourth train to arrive (20 minutes). 

Total waiting time = 10 + 65 + 125 + 20 = 220 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toothpicks Melanie has saved so far and then determine how many more weeks it will take her to reach 200 toothpicks.

Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks per week for 12 weeks. To find the total number of toothpicks saved, we multiply the number of toothpicks saved per week by the number of weeks:

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks in total, we subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total:

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Melanie to save the remaining 80 toothpicks at the same rate of 10 toothpicks per week. To do this, we divide the number of toothpicks needed by the number of toothpicks saved per week:

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we need to first find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and then the price at which he sold it.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price, so the price he paid is:

$2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Now, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is $1500. So, the price at which he sold it is:

$1500 * 1.20 = $1800

The original price of the watch is $2000, and the price at which Mr. Rogers sold it is $1800. To find the discount, we subtract the selling price from the original price:

$2000 - $1800 = $200

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:

($200 / $2000) * 100 = 10%

Therefore, Mr. Rogers' friend obtained a 10% discount from the original price."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we need to determine the rate at which the springs create jellyfish. Since every second, a spring creates a new jellyfish, we can say that each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second.

Since there are 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created per second is 5.

Now, we need to convert the time from hours to seconds. There are 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute. So, there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.

We are asked to find the number of jellyfish created in 4 hours. To do this, we multiply the number of jellyfish created per second by the number of seconds in 4 hours.

Number of jellyfish created per second = 5
Number of seconds in 4 hours = 3600
Total number of jellyfish created in 4 hours = 5 * 3600 = 18000

Therefore, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 18000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to translate the given information into an equation. Let's denote Frankie's score as F and Binkie's score as B. We know that Frankie's score is 15 more than twice as high as Binkie's, so we can write the equation:

F = 2B + 15

We are also given that Binkie's score is 90, so we can substitute B = 90 into the equation:

F = 2(90) + 15
F = 180 + 15
F = 195

Therefore, Frankie's score was 195.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it took James to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.

First, let's calculate the time it took James to walk to the store. Since he walked 4 miles at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

So, it took James 1 hour to walk to the store.

Next, let's calculate the time it took James to walk back home. Since he walked the same distance (4 miles) at the same speed (4 miles per hour), we can again use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

Since James walked to the store and back, the total time it took him to reach the store is the sum of the time it took him to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.

Total Time = Time to walk to the store + Time to walk back home
Total Time = 1 hour + 1 hour
Total Time = 2 hours

Therefore, it took James 2 hours to reach the store.

"To determine the amount of money saved, we first need to calculate the total cost of buying the bananas individually and then the total cost of buying them in bunches.

If Jenny buys 10 bunches of bananas, and each bunch contains 4 bananas, she will buy a total of 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

The cost of buying 10 bunches of bananas is $3.00 per bunch, so the total cost would be 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find the amount of money saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total amount of fence that Sam and Harry will receive. Since they are splitting the fence, we can represent the amount of fence that Sam receives as 'x'. Then, the amount of fence that Harry receives would be 'x + 60'. 

Since the total length of the fence is 100 feet, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 60) = 100.

Combine like terms: 2x + 60 = 100.

Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20.

So, Sam receives 20 feet of fence. 

The amount of fence left over for Sam is 100 - 20 = 80 feet.

"To find the rate of growth, we need to divide the total growth (8 inches) by the number of years (4). 

8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year

Now, we can multiply the rate of growth by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

The crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply that by its respective price.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold. Since half of the 300 bikes were Trekking bikes, we have 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

Next, we know that 15% of the 300 bikes were BMX bikes. To find the number of BMX bikes, we calculate 15% of 300, which is 0.15 * 300 = 45 BMX bikes.

Now, we can find the number of MTB bikes by subtracting the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total: 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

The prices of the bikes are $500 for MTB, $250 for BMX (half of $500), and $450 for Trekking.

To find the total earnings, we multiply the number of each type of bike by its price and add them together:

Total earnings = (105 MTB * $500) + (45 BMX * $250) + (150 Trekking * $450)
Total earnings = $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500
Total earnings = $131,250

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck, and then subtract the latter from the former.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

Now, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer: 30 - 18 = 12.

Therefore, 12 bales of hay are left in the field.

"To find the total minutes John spends in classes, we first need to calculate the total minutes he spends in classes per week. 

There are 5 days of classes, and each class is 40 minutes long. So, the total minutes spent in classes per week is 5 * 40 = 200 minutes.

Since John also spends extra time on Saturday and Sunday, we need to calculate the total minutes spent on these days. There are 2 days, and he spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these days. 

First, we need to find the total minutes in a week. There are 24 hours in a day, and 60 minutes in an hour. So, there are 24 * 60 = 1440 minutes in a day. 

Since John spends 5 days in classes, the total minutes spent in classes is 200 minutes. The remaining minutes in the week are 1440 - 200 = 1240 minutes. 

Now, we can find the total minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday. 1/16 of 1240 is 1240 / 16 = 77.5 minutes. 

So, the total minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday is 77.5 * 2 = 155 minutes. 

Now, we can find the total minutes spent on learning per week. The total minutes spent in classes is 200 minutes, and the total minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday is 155 minutes. 

Total minutes spent on learning per week is 200 + 155 = 355 minutes.

To convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 355 / 60 = 5.9167 hours.

The final answer is 5.9167."

"To determine the total earnings of the orchard, we need to divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10) to find the total number of bags sold. 

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Since each bag is sold at $5, we multiply the total number of bags by the price per bag to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the last step. 

The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms of meat, which was half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. So, before the Allosaurus ate, there were 2 * 270 = 540 kilograms of meat.

The T-Rex ate half of the original amount, so before the T-Rex ate, there were 2 * 540 = 1080 kilograms of meat.

Therefore, the triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate.

"To determine the total cost of painting the room, we first need to calculate the total area of the walls. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each of these walls has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, their combined area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each of these walls has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, their combined area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

The total area of the four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint to cover the entire room.

The cost of 12 gallons of paint is 12 x $12 = $144.

"To determine the likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the number of shaken cans and the total number of cans remaining.

Initially, Ellen shook 3 cans. After her brother took 1 shaken can, there were 2 shaken cans left. Ellen's friend then took 2 unshaken cans, but this doesn't affect the number of shaken cans. So, there are still 2 shaken cans left.

The total number of cans remaining is 12 (initial cans) - 3 (shaken cans) - 1 (taken by Ellen's brother) - 2 (taken by Ellen's friend) = 6 cans.

The probability of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans remaining, which is 2/6 or 1/3.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/3) * 100 = 33.33%.

The final answer is 33.33."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then add those distances together to find the total distance between them.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 3 hours, it will travel 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half that distance per hour, which is 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they traveled to find the total distance between them. So, the total distance between the two trains is 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we first need to calculate the number of days he is available to work. 

There are 31 days in March, and Billy takes 20% of these days off. 20% of 31 is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round down to 6 days off. 

So, Billy is available to work 31 - 6 = 25 days. 

Billy can help 2 people per hour, and he works for 3 hours a day. Therefore, he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day. 

To find the total number of people he can help, we multiply the number of days he is available to work by the number of people he can help per day: 25 * 6 = 150.

Next, let's calculate the total number of people in the cars:
20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Now, we subtract the total number of people in the cars from the total number of people in the buses to find the number of people inside the church:

"To find the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total minutes and then convert it to hours.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and a 15-minute break per day. 

Total minutes per day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 15 minutes (break) = 45 minutes

Since this is for 5 days, we multiply the total minutes per day by 5:

Total minutes = 45 minutes/day * 5 days = 225 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

Total hours = 225 minutes / 60 = 3.75 hours

The total time Bobby spends on his lunches and breaks is 3.75 hours."
"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

Micah's distance = 3.5 * Amber's distance
Micah's distance = 3.5 * 8
Micah's distance = 28 miles

Now that we know Micah ran 28 miles, we can find Ahito's distance by subtracting the total distance run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

Ahito's distance = Total distance - (Amber's distance + Micah's distance)
Ahito's distance = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's distance = 52 - 36
Ahito's distance = 16 miles

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after the discounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan:
Original price: $20.00
Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Discounted price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the towels:
Original price: $30.00
Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
Discounted price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items purchased:
Cost of frying pan: $16.00
Cost of towels: $27.00
Total cost: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card and returned $15.00, so the new balance before the new purchases is:
$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Now, let's add the total cost of the new items to the new balance:
$70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5. 

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (1/3)*(x/5) = x/15.

The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue. Since the other jellyfish are small, the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We know that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means 6 jellyfish are either large or small. Since the large jellyfish change color, the number of large jellyfish that changed color is 6. 

We can set up an equation to represent the situation: 

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

Therefore, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

90"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the age relationships between Caroline, Ben, and Chris. 

We know that Chris is 4 years old. Since Ben is two times older than Chris, we can calculate Ben's age as follows: 
Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now, we know that Caroline is three times older than Ben. So, we can calculate Caroline's age as follows:
Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we first need to calculate her annual savings. Since she saves 20% of her current salary, her annual savings would be 20% of $100,000, which is 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000.

Next, we need to calculate her annual expenses. Since she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, her annual expenses would be 40% of $100,000, which is 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000.

Now, we can calculate her annual savings after expenses, which is $20,000 - $40,000 = -$20,000. This means she is actually spending more than she is saving, which is not possible. However, assuming she can save the same amount each year, we can proceed with the calculation.

To calculate the number of years she needs to work, we can divide the total amount she needs to save by her annual savings. Since she needs to save for 20 years, we can divide $1,000,000 (20 years * $50,000 per year) by $20,000. 

$1,000,000 / $20,000 = 50 years

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save $1,000,000. Since she already has $100,000, we need to subtract the time she has already worked. Assuming she has been working for 0 years, we can subtract 0 from 50.

50 years

Since Lauren can't work for a fraction of a year, we can round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can't round up because she can't work for a fraction of a year.

The final answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we need to divide the 100 centimeters of ribbon into 4 equal parts. This can be done by dividing 100 by 4, which equals 25 centimeters per part.

Next, we need to divide each of these 25 centimeter parts into 5 equal parts. This can be done by dividing 25 by 5, which equals 5 centimeters per final cut.

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we can use the given percentage of boys. Since 40% of the school population is made up of boys, we can set up the following proportion:

40% of x = 240

To solve for x, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:

0.4x = 240

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.4 to isolate x:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

Since we want to find the number of girls, we can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

Therefore, there are 360 girls in the school.

"To find the average height of heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide it by the total number of heels.

The total height of heels is the sum of the heights of the heels worn by the three women wearing 4 inch heels and the three women wearing 2 inch heels. 

Total height = (3 * 4) + (3 * 2) 
Total height = 12 + 6 
Total height = 18 

There are 6 heels in total. 

Average height = Total height / Total number of heels 
Average height = 18 / 6 
Average height = 3 

The average height of heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we need to calculate the total number of days she has available for hiking and then divide the total miles she wants to hike by that number.

Since Soledad will be on vacation for the entire month of June, which has 30 days, she has 30 days available for hiking.

The total miles she wants to hike is 9,300 miles. 

To find out how many miles per day she needs to hike, we divide the total miles by the number of days: 
9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day.

Since she is already planning to hike 125 miles per day, we subtract this from the required daily amount to find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day:
310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day.

So, Soledad must hike 185 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

"To determine the total amount the store will receive after all the balls are sold, we need to calculate the total revenue from each color of ball and then sum them up.

Red balls: 3 * $9 = $27
Blue balls: 11 * $5 = $55
Green balls: 25 * $3 = $75

Total revenue = $27 + $55 + $75 = $157

"To find out how much each person gets, we need to calculate the total amount each person wants.

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg.

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

Since Jacques is not mentioned in the question, we can assume that Jacques is the one left with the remaining amount. 

The total amount taken by Pierre and Paul is 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

So, Jacques will have 12 - 7 = 5 kg left.

"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the initial amount he had.

Raymond initially had $21.
He saved $11 from his allowance, so now he has $21 + $11 = $32.
He spent $5 on a comic book, so now he has $32 - $5 = $27.
He then spent $19 on a puzzle, so now he has $27 - $19 = $8.

Raymond has $8 left.

"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first determine the total amount Anna spent on the books. Since she had a budget of $16 and has $2 left, she spent $16 - $2 = $14 on the books.

We know that she bought 2 books, and both books cost the same amount. Let's call the cost of each book 'x'. Since she spent $14 on 2 books, we can set up the equation:

2x = 14

To find the cost of each book, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 14 / 2
x = 7

So, each book cost $7.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many times the light blinks per minute. We can do this by dividing the total number of blinks (255) by the total number of minutes (5).

255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take for the light to blink 459 times. We can do this by dividing the total number of blinks (459) by the number of blinks per minute (51).

459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute = 9 minutes

Therefore, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times.

After Tate's purchase:
- Male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
- Female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of female and male fish. 
- Total female fish: 8 (guppies) + 8 (goldfish) = 16

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn. Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog. 

Dior took over 4 hours longer than Amalia, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

To find the total time, we need to add the time each person took: 4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours.

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"To determine the total distance John drives in a month, we need to calculate the round-trip distance for one visit and then multiply it by the number of visits.

The distance for one round trip is calculated as follows:
Distance = 2 * Speed * Time
Distance = 2 * 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 280 miles

Since John visits his parents twice a month, the total distance he drives in a month is:
Total Distance = 2 * 280 miles
Total Distance = 560 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers. 

Two workers produce 6 toys per hour, so together they produce 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour. The other two workers produce 4 toys per hour, so together they produce 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour. 

So, the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers per hour is 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys after 10 hours of work, the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in 10 hours is 20 * 10 = 200 toys.

The total number of toys needed is 400, and 200 toys have already been produced, so the remaining number of toys needed is 400 - 200 = 200 toys.

Since the first 4 workers have already produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must produce the remaining 200 toys in 10 hours. 

To find the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker (200) by the number of hours worked (10). 

200 / 10 = 20 toys per hour.

"To find the weight of Elijah's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each dog and then add them together.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of both dogs: 15 pounds + 30 pounds = 45 pounds.

So, Elijah and Kory's dogs weigh altogether 60 pounds + 45 pounds = 105 pounds.

"To determine the total number of M&M's John has, we need to calculate the total weight of the large bags and then multiply it by the number of M&M's per ounce. 

Since each large bag weighs 10 ounces, and there are 3 large bags, the total weight is 3 * 10 = 30 ounces. 

Since each ounce contains 30 M&M's, the total number of M&M's is 30 * 30 = 900.

Now, we need to find out how many small bags John can make with 10 M&M's in each bag. To do this, we divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag: 900 / 10 = 90.

Therefore, John can make 90 small bags of M&M's.

"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, we know the average car's speed is 120 Miles per hour. 

Since the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, we can calculate its speed as follows:
2nd fastest car's speed = 5 * average car's speed
2nd fastest car's speed = 5 * 120
2nd fastest car's speed = 600 Miles per hour

Now, we know the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we can calculate its speed as follows:
Faster car's speed = 1.25 * 2nd fastest car's speed
Faster car's speed = 1.25 * 600
Faster car's speed = 750 Miles per hour

The faster car goes 750 Miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, we need to use algebra. Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as 'x'. Since Liam's age two years ago was twice Vince's age, we can set up the equation: 

2x = Liam's age two years ago

We know that Liam is 16 years old now, so his age two years ago was 16 - 2 = 14. 

Now we can substitute 14 for 2x in the equation: 

2x = 14

To find x, we divide both sides by 2: 

x = 14 / 2
x = 7

Since x represents Vince's age two years ago, we need to add 2 to find Vince's current age: 

Vince's current age = x + 2
Vince's current age = 7 + 2
Vince's current age = 9

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A, the number of eggs painted by Madeline as M, the number of eggs painted by Camden as C, and the number of eggs painted by Sarah as S.

We are given the following information:

1. A = M (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)
2. C + S = 30 (Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)
3. C = S + 12 (Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah)

We can substitute the first equation into the third equation to get:
A = M = S + 12

Now, we can substitute the value of A and M into the second equation:
(S + 12) + S = 30

Combine like terms:
2S + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides:
2S = 18

Divide both sides by 2:
S = 9

Now that we know S, we can find C:
C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Now that we know C, we can find A:
A = S
A = 9

To find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold, we subtract A from C:
C - A = 21 - 9
C - A = 12

"To find the total weight of the crayons, we first need to determine how many boxes Nik can fill with 200 crayons. Since each box can hold 8 crayons, we divide 200 by 8 to get 25 boxes.

Now, we need to find the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, 200 crayons weigh 200 ounces. 

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, 25 boxes weigh 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Now, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we divide 200 ounces by 16 to get 12.5 pounds.

The total weight of the crayons and boxes is the sum of the weight of the crayons and the weight of the boxes, which is 12.5 + 12.5 = 25 pounds.

Since he cuts the logs into 4-foot logs, he can make 64 / 4 = 16 logs.

From each log, he cuts 5 planks, so he can make 16 * 5 = 80 planks.

He sells each plank for $1.2, so he makes 80 * $1.2 = $96.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the amount of money Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns half of what her brother earns, we can set up an equation: 

Let's denote the brother's salary as B. 
Valerie's salary = 1/2 * B
Since Valerie earns $5000 per month, we can set up the equation: 
5000 = 1/2 * B
To solve for B, we multiply both sides by 2:
B = 5000 * 2
B = 10000

Now that we know the brother's salary, we can find their mother's salary. The mother earns twice their combined salary. 
Combined salary = Valerie's salary + brother's salary
Combined salary = 5000 + 10000
Combined salary = 15000
Mother's salary = 2 * combined salary
Mother's salary = 2 * 15000
Mother's salary = 30000

Now, we can find the total amount of money they all have together:
Total amount = Valerie's salary + brother's salary + mother's salary
Total amount = 5000 + 10000 + 30000
Total amount = 40000

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine Grandma's walking speed on the beach and the sidewalk. 

Let's denote the speed on the beach as 'b' miles per minute. Since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk at twice the speed of the beach, her speed on the sidewalk is 2b miles per minute.

We know that she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, so the distance covered on the beach is 40b miles. Since the distance on the beach is 2 miles, we can set up the equation 2 = 40b. Solving for b, we get b = 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.

Now, we can calculate the time taken to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk, which is 1 / (2b) = 1 / (2 * 1/20) = 10 minutes.

The total time taken to walk 3 miles is the sum of the time taken on the beach and the sidewalk, which is 40 + 10 = 50 minutes.

Since she wants to save a total of $60, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal:

$60 - $32 = $28

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save the remaining amount of $28 at a rate of $4 per week:

So, if he receives 24 marbles, he will have 60 marbles. To find the initial number of marbles, we subtract 24 from 60. 

60 - 24 = 36

Now, if he loses 10 marbles, we subtract 10 from 36.

36 - 10 = 26

Therefore, Bob will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, let's analyze the situation. 

Initially, Donny has two mugs of water, one at 33 degrees and the other at an unknown temperature. He pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug, and then he can drink the water.

Since he can drink the water after pouring, the total amount of water he has is at least 5 ounces. This means the second mug must contain at least 5 ounces of water.

Let's assume the second mug contains x ounces of water. Since the total amount of water Donny has after pouring is 5 ounces, we can set up the equation:

4 + 1 = x

This equation is not correct, as it doesn't take into account the temperature of the water. However, we can use the information that Donny can drink the water after pouring to infer that the temperature of the second mug must be at least 40 degrees.

If the second mug contained less than 5 ounces of water, it would not be enough to make the total amount of water 5 ounces after pouring. Therefore, the second mug must contain at least 5 ounces of water.

Since Donny can drink the water after pouring, the temperature of the second mug must be at least 40 degrees. This is because the water from the 33-degree mug is not enough to make the total amount of water 5 ounces.

The minimum temperature of the second mug is 40 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added by each company and add them to the initial number of animals.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.

Melkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day for three weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 3 * 7 = 21 days. So, the total number of cows added is 20 * 21 = 420 cows.

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day for three weeks. So, the total number of chickens added is 10 * 21 = 210 chickens.

Now, we add the initial number of animals to the number of animals added:

Cows: 50 + 420 = 470 cows
Chickens: 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 470 + 230 = 700.

"To find the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs without the discount. 

Each pack costs $10.00, and there are 4 packs, so the total cost is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $40.00. 10% of $40.00 is 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since there are 9 bagels in each pack, and Russell ordered 4 packs, he received 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

To find the cost of each bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we need to find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

Let's denote the number of scoops as S and the number of potatoes as P. We can set up the equation: 
P = 6 - 3 = 3

This means that 3 potatoes make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. 

Now, we know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, we can set up another equation:
S = 23 - 5 = 18

Now we know that Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

Since 3 potatoes make 1 scoop, we can find the number of potatoes Gomer ate by multiplying the number of scoops by 3:
P = 18 * 3 = 54

Therefore, Gomer ate 54 potatoes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day, so he eats 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day, so he eats 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

The total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days is 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens: 240 / 12 = 20.

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of red jelly beans. Since there are twice as many red jelly beans as green jelly beans, and there are 17 green jelly beans, we can calculate the number of red jelly beans as 2 * 17 = 34.

Now, we know that the total number of jelly beans is 60, and we have already accounted for 17 green and 34 red jelly beans. To find the number of blue jelly beans, we subtract the total number of green and red jelly beans from the total number of jelly beans: 60 - 17 - 34 = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 blue jelly beans in the jar.

"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the number of lemons he gets in a year and then multiply it by 10.

Since Tim grows 5 trees and each tree yields 6 lemons per year, the total number of lemons he gets in a year is 5 * 6 = 30.

To find the total number of lemons in a decade, we multiply the annual amount by 10: 30 * 10 = 300.

Therefore, Tim gets 300 lemons in a decade.

"To find the number of women who have remained on the bus, we first need to determine the total number of women on the bus initially. 

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means that for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total number of parts in the ratio is 5 + 9 = 14. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can divide 84 by 14 to find the value of one part of the ratio. 

84 / 14 = 6

Now, we multiply the value of one part by the number of parts representing women in the ratio to find the initial number of women on the bus. 

9 parts * 6 = 54

Since 20 women alight from the bus, we subtract 20 from the initial number of women to find the number of women who have remained on the bus.

54 - 20 = 34

The number of women who have remained on the bus is 34."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many bouquets Faraday sold. We know that he earned $56 from each bouquet, and he earned a total of $56 + $26 = $82 in 3 days. 

Divide the total earnings by the cost of each bouquet: $82 / $8 = 10.25 bouquets. Since we can't sell a fraction of a bouquet, we'll round down to 10 bouquets.

Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, so multiply the number of bouquets by the number of sunflowers per bouquet: 10 * 12 = 120 sunflowers.

The final answer is: 120"
"To determine the amount of money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys and the revenue he generates from selling 60% of his inventory.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks. Since Adam invests all his $100, he buys 100 / 5 = 20 rocks.

The revenue from selling 60% of his inventory is 20 * 0.6 = 12 rocks. He sells each rock for $7, so the total revenue is 12 * 7 = $84.

Now, we subtract the total revenue from the total cost to find the loss: 100 - 84 = $16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To determine the number of days required for Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the time it takes to complete each type of picture scene and then find the maximum time among them.

For large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
For medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
For small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

Since 9 days is the maximum time required, Lauren will take 9 days to complete the project.

"To determine the number of eggs each child receives, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. 

First, we need to convert the number of eggs from dozens to individual eggs. Since one dozen is equal to 12 eggs, three dozen eggs would be 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, we divide the total number of eggs (36) by the number of children (4) to find out how many eggs each child receives. 

36 ÷ 4 = 9

So, each child receives 9 eggs.

"To determine the total amount Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to calculate the daily cost of food for all three fish and then multiply it by the number of days in May.

May has 31 days. Each fish requires $1 worth of food per day, so the total daily cost for all three fish is 3 * $1 = $3.

To find the total cost for the month, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days in May: $3 * 31 = $93.

The final answer is: 93"
"To find the total number of roses Patricia has now, we need to subtract the number of roses she gave to her mother from the initial number of roses she had, and then add the number of roses she bought.

Initial number of roses = 30
Number of roses given to her mother = 24
Number of roses bought = 15

Total number of roses now = Initial number of roses - Number of roses given to her mother + Number of roses bought
= 30 - 24 + 15
= 21

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Total distance traveled = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles
Total time taken = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
= 250 miles / 5 hours
= 50 miles per hour

The average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each individual ticket winning. 

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as 0.2 in decimal form. The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

Now, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of seashells each person collected. 

We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, we can find the number of seashells Carlos collected by subtracting 5 from Jim's total: 27 - 5 = 22.

Since Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, we can divide Carlos's total by 2 to find Carrey's total: 22 / 2 = 11.

Now that we know the total number of seashells each person collected, we can divide them equally among the three of them. To do this, we add up the total number of seashells and divide by 3: 27 + 22 + 11 = 60. 60 / 3 = 20.

So, each person got 20 seashells.

20"
"To determine the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday, and there are 2 weekend days. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 * 2 = 10.

To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we add the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the number of carrots he eats on the weekend. So, the total number of carrots he eats in a week is 20 + 10 = 30.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. Since the second song is 60% longer than the first song, we can calculate its length as follows:

Length of the second song = 5 minutes + (60% of 5 minutes)
= 5 minutes + (0.6 * 5 minutes)
= 5 minutes + 3 minutes
= 8 minutes

Now, we can find the total time of the cassette by adding the lengths of both songs:

Total time = Length of the first song + Length of the second song
= 5 minutes + 8 minutes
= 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes."
"To calculate the total profit, we need to first find the total cost of the devices and the total revenue from selling them.

The cost of 2 devices bought on Monday is 2 * $20 = $40.
The cost of 4 devices bought on Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80.
The total cost is $40 + $80 = $120.

The selling price of each device is twice the cost, so the selling price of each device is 2 * $20 = $40.
The total revenue from selling 6 devices is 6 * $40 = $240.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost, which is $240 - $120 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the height of Carl based on the information given about his family members. 

Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned's height is 7 - 2 = 5 feet. 

Since Carl is one foot taller than Ned, Carl's height is 5 + 1 = 6 feet.

The problem states that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet.

"To determine the number of bottles needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total energy demand of 2300 people.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the total energy demand as follows:

2300 people * 100% = 2300
2300 * 20% = 460 bottles per person
Total energy demand = 460 bottles

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many days it will take to produce 460 bottles.

460 bottles / 4200 bottles per day = 0.109 days

However, we are interested in the number of bottles needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, not the number of days. To find this, we can simply multiply the total energy demand by 1 (since 100% of the energy demand is already covered by 460 bottles).

460 bottles * 1 = 460 bottles

To find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce, we subtract the current production capacity from the total number of bottles needed:

460 bottles - 4200 bottles = -3740 bottles

Since we cannot produce a negative number of bottles, this means that Hortex cannot satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people with its current production capacity."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the total number of babies wearing purple. Since Carla dresses 3/4 of the octuplets in purple, and there are 8 babies in total, the number of babies wearing purple is 3/4 * 8 = 6.

Now, we know that 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows. So, the number of babies wearing both purple and bows is 1/3 * 6 = 2.

We also know that all the blue-wearers wear bows. Since there are 1/4 of the babies wearing blue, the number of babies wearing blue is 1/4 * 8 = 2.

Now, we can find the total number of babies wearing bows. This is the sum of the babies wearing both purple and bows, and the babies wearing blue, which is 2 + 2 = 4.

To find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we divide the number of babies wearing both purple and bows by the total number of babies wearing bows, and then multiply by 100. 

So, the percentage chance is (2/4) * 100 = 50%.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday.

Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Total reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday = 1907 + 2136 = 4043

Now, subtract the total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total number of reports received last week to find the number of reports received on Wednesday.

Total reports received last week = 5168
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043 = 1125

The IRS received 1125 reports on Wednesday."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Abraham initially has 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.

Now, he has 80 - 40 = 40 square meters left. He then sold 1/4 of this remaining land for $30. 1/4 of 40 square meters is 10 square meters. So, he sold 10 square meters for $30.

Now, he has 40 - 10 = 30 square meters left. He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, he sold 30 square meters for 30 * 3 = $90.

To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn, we need to add the money he earned from each sale. He earned $50 from the first sale, $30 from the second sale, and $90 from the third sale. So, the total amount of money he will earn is $50 + $30 + $90 = $170.

The final answer is: $170"
"To find Geb's age, we need to first find half of Haley's age. 

Half of Haley's age is 26 / 2 = 13.

Since Geb is 10 years less than half of Haley's age, we subtract 10 from 13. 

Geb's age is 13 - 10 = 3.

"To determine the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to calculate the number of face masks he uses in a day and then multiply it by 2.

Since Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out, and he goes out three times a day, he uses 2 * 3 = 6 face masks per day.

To find the total number of face masks used every 2 days, we multiply the daily usage by 2: 6 * 2 = 12.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs found by each person and subtract that from the initial number of eggs hidden.

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.
Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 x 5 = 10 eggs.
Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by each person: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from and then multiply it by the number of collections per week and the payment per collection.

First, let's find the total number of apartments in the last complex. Since it's 60% bigger than the other two combined, we need to find the total number of apartments in the first two complexes. 

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so together they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. 

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. So, the last complex has 240 more apartments than the other two combined. 

The total number of apartments in the last complex is 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we can find the total number of apartments John collects garbage from in a week. He collects garbage 3 times a week from each complex, so the total number of apartments is:

(200 + 200 + 640) * 3 = 1040 apartments

John gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are:

1040 * 0.40 = $416

The final answer is: $416"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. A 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
2. A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the amount of a 5-year-old tree, so it produces 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
3. A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the amount of a 5-year-old tree, so it produces 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
4. An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, but we don't know the amount produced by a 10-year-old tree yet. Let's call it x. So, an 8-year-old tree produces x - 200 fruits.
5. A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits.
6. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, so it produces 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, we know the amount of fruits produced by a 10-year-old tree. We can find the amount produced by an 8-year-old tree by setting up an equation: 
x - 200 = 350 (since an 8-year-old tree produces 350 fruits)
x = 550

Now we know the amount of fruits produced by an 8-year-old tree. We can find the total amount of fruits produced by the tree during its 10 years of life by adding the fruits produced by each age:
50 + 150 + 350 + 550 + 0 + 1000 = 2050

The total amount of fruits that an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 2050."

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the length of the blue rope as B, and the length of the red rope as R. 

We are given the following information:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: R = 4B
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: B = Y - 7
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: R + B + Y = 37

We can substitute the first equation into the third equation to get:
4B + B + Y = 37
Combine like terms:
5B + Y = 37

Now, substitute the second equation into the previous equation:
5(B + 7) + Y = 37
Expand and simplify:
5B + 35 + Y = 37
Subtract 35 from both sides:
5B + Y = 2

Now we have two equations:
5B + Y = 2
B = Y - 7

Substitute the second equation into the first equation:
5(Y - 7) + Y = 2
Expand and simplify:
5Y - 35 + Y = 2
Combine like terms:
6Y - 35 = 2
Add 35 to both sides:
6Y = 37
Divide both sides by 6:
Y = 6.17 (approximately)

Now that we have the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
B = Y - 7
B = 6.17 - 7
B = -0.83 (approximately)

Now that we have the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope:
R = 4B
R = 4 * -0.83
R = -3.32 (approximately)

However, since the length of a rope cannot be negative, there seems to be an error in the initial setup of the equations. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Re-evaluate the equations:
R = 4B
B = Y - 7
R + B + Y = 37

Substitute the first equation into the third equation:
4B + B + Y = 37
Combine like terms:
5B + Y = 37

Now, substitute the second equation into the previous equation:
4(Y - 7) + Y = 37
Expand and simplify:
4Y - 28 + Y = 37
Combine like terms:
5Y - 28 = 37
Add 28 to both sides:
5Y = 65
Divide both sides by 5:
Y = 13

Now that we have the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
B = Y - 7
B = 13 - 7
B = 6

Now that we have the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope:
R = 4B
R = 4 * 6
R = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much money Rissa and Ronnie initially had. 

Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so if Ronnie had x dollars, Rissa had 3x dollars. 

After giving an equal amount of money to their sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. Let's say she gave y dollars to her sister. Then, 3x - y = (4/5)(3x). 

We also know that Ronnie gave y dollars to her sister, so Ronnie is left with x - y dollars. 

Since Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, we can set up the equation (3x - y) = (4/5)(3x). 

Simplifying the equation, we get 3x - y = 12x/5. 

Now, we also know that Ronnie gave y dollars to her sister, so x - y = y. 

Simplifying this equation, we get x = 2y. 

Substituting x = 2y into the first equation, we get 3(2y) - y = 12x/5. 

Simplifying, we get 5y = 12x/5. 

Substituting x = 2y, we get 5y = 12(2y)/5. 

Simplifying, we get 5y = 24y/5. 

Multiplying both sides by 5, we get 25y = 24y. 

Subtracting 24y from both sides, we get y = 0. 

Since y = 0, x = 2y = 0. 

This means Ronnie had 0 dollars initially. 

So, Ronnie is left with 0 dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know that half the mural is yellow, so the other half must be the remaining three colors. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can divide the remaining half by 3 to find the amount of each color. 

12 pints / 2 = 6 pints for the remaining half of the mural. 
6 pints / 3 = 2 pints for each of the colors red, white, and purple.

Since we are asked to find the amount of red paint used, the answer is 2 pints.

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of each room and then add them together.

First, we know the area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, we add the areas of all the rooms together: 240 (bedrooms) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 2440 square feet.

The total area of the house is 2440 square feet.

On Thursday, she counted double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.

On Friday, she counted double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find the cost of the new box of 120 pods. Since the price remains the same, the cost of the new box is also $12. 

Now, we need to find out how many cycles we can run with the new box for $1. We can do this by dividing $1 by the cost of one pod in the new box. 

First, we need to find the cost of one pod in the new box. Since the new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, it has 120 pods. The cost of one pod in the new box is $12 / 120 = $0.1 per pod.

Now, we can divide $1 by the cost of one pod in the new box to find out how many cycles we can run: $1 / $0.1 = 10.

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Thomas initially withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he now has 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he pays with 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

Thomas then triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling it means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 / 5 = 12 five-dollar bills.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first half and the second half.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Since team B scored 2 goals in the first half, team B scored 4 times that amount in the second half, which is 2 * 4 = 8 goals. Therefore, team A scores 1/4 of 8 goals, which is 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

Now, we can calculate the total number of goals scored in the match. In the first half, team A scored 4 goals and team B scored 2 goals, for a total of 4 + 2 = 6 goals. In the second half, team A scored 2 goals and team B scored 8 goals, for a total of 2 + 8 = 10 goals. The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 + 10 = 16 goals.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total amount of chalk the teacher started with. Since he used 45% of the chalk on Monday, we can set up an equation to find the total amount of chalk.

Let's denote the total amount of chalk as x. Since the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, the amount of chalk used on Monday is 0.2x. We know that this amount is 45% of the total chalk, so we can set up the equation:

0.2x = 0.45x

However, this equation doesn't make sense, as it implies that 0.2x is equal to 0.45x, which is not possible. This means that the teacher must have started with more than 100% of the chalk. Let's re-evaluate the situation.

Since the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, the amount of chalk used on Monday is 0.2x. We know that this amount is 45% of the total chalk, but we also know that the teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk. Since the teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we can assume that the 5-inch piece of chalk is the initial amount.

Let's re-evaluate the situation:

0.2x = 0.45(5)

0.2x = 2.25

x = 11.25

So, the teacher started with 11.25 inches of chalk.

Now that we know the total amount of chalk, we can find out how many days it will take for the teacher to use up the chalk at the rate of 20% per day.

Let's denote the number of days as n. We can set up the equation:

0.2n = 11.25

n = 11.25 / 0.2

n = 56.25

Since the teacher can't use a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this context, it's more logical to round down to the nearest whole number because the teacher can't use a fraction of a day to write with the chalk.

n = 56

The teacher has 56 days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk."

"To find out how many face masks Johnny bought, we need to first determine how many face masks Mike bought. Mike bought 5 face masks.

Since Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike, we can calculate the number of face masks Johnny bought as follows:

Thrice the number of face masks Mike bought is 3 * 5 = 15
Adding 2 more face masks to this amount gives us 15 + 2 = 17

Therefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

"To find the total number of teeth fixed, we need to add the number of teeth drilled and capped. 

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more than that, so the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

The total number of teeth fixed is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we divide the total number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth James has, then multiply by 100.

Percentage = (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is 50."
"To calculate the amount of milk that Mr. Marcellus returned, we need to find 2/5 of 4000 gallons. 

2/5 of 4000 gallons = (2/5) * 4000 = 1600 gallons

Since Mr. Marcellus is returning 1600 gallons of milk, we need to calculate the total refund amount. 

The cost of milk per gallon is $3.5. 

Refund amount = 1600 gallons * $3.5 per gallon = $5600

The final answer is: $5600"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be expressed as:

W = 5(C + 7)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

W = 5C + 35

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be expressed as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Substituting the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

C = 20

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to first determine the total number of books he can buy with $27,000. 

Since Bob can buy 100 books for $500, we can find the cost per book by dividing $500 by 100 books. 

Cost per book = $500 / 100 books = $5 per book

Now, we can find the total number of books Bob can buy with $27,000 by dividing $27,000 by the cost per book.

Total number of books = $27,000 / $5 per book = 5,400 books

Since Bob is distributing the books between 3 schools, we can divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books he can buy per school.

Number of books per school = 5,400 books / 3 schools = 1,800 books per school

The final answer is: 1,800"
"This scenario is a classic example of a thought experiment in philosophy, specifically in the context of causality and the concept of causation. It is often used to illustrate the problem of causality and the difficulty of determining the causal relationship between events.

From a philosophical perspective, the question is not about the physical outcome of Newton's actions, but rather about the causal relationships between the events. The question asks us to consider the causal chain of events and how they are connected.

From a purely physical perspective, we can analyze the situation as follows:

1. Two apples fell out of the tree initially.
2. Newton picked up one apple and threw the other, causing 5 more apples to fall out.
3. Newton picked up 5 apples and threw 1, causing 6 more apples to fall out.

However, from a philosophical perspective, the question is more complex. We need to consider the causal relationships between the events. The question asks us to consider whether the throwing of the apple by Newton caused the 6 additional apples to fall out of the tree. This is a classic problem in philosophy, known as the ""causal chain"" or ""chain of causation"" problem.

From a philosophical perspective, the answer to the question is not a simple numerical value, but rather a nuanced understanding of the causal relationships between the events. However, if we were to provide a numerical answer based on the physical events described, we could say that Newton initially had 2 apples, then 7, then 13, and finally 12 apples.

"To determine the cost of Ali's coal order, we need to calculate the total number of 50 kg bags and then multiply it by the cost per unit.

First, we divide the total weight of coal (850 kg) by the weight per bag (50 kg) to find the total number of bags: 850 kg / 50 kg/bag = 17 bags.

Now, we multiply the total number of bags by the cost per unit ($18): 17 bags * $18/bag = $306.

The total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To determine the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza is consumed. 

For the cheese pizza, 6 friends eat 6 slices each, so the total number of slices consumed is 6 friends * 6 slices = 36 slices. Since each cheese pizza has 12 slices, Kate needs 36 / 12 = 3 cheese pizzas.

For the pepperoni pizza, 6 friends eat 4 slices each, so the total number of slices consumed is 6 friends * 4 slices = 24 slices. Since each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, Kate needs 24 / 8 = 3 pepperoni pizzas.

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

"To find the total miles Sam ran this week, we need to add the miles he ran on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday to the miles he ran on Tuesday and Thursday.

Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, which is a total of 3 * 3 = 9 miles.
Sam ran 5 miles on Tuesday and Thursday, which is a total of 5 * 2 = 10 miles.

Now, we add the miles from both periods: 9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the rate at which Jay builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which means he builds 20/60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute. 

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. So, the net rate of snowball production is 1/3 - 2/30 = 1/3 - 1/15 = 2/15 snowballs per minute.

To find out how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we can divide 60 by the net rate of snowball production: 60 / (2/15) = 60 * (15/2) = 450 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Jay 450 minutes to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

We know that John is 28 now and that he was twice as old as Jim when Digimon was released. 

Let's denote Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release as 'x'. Since John was twice as old as Jim, we can express John's age at the time of Digimon's release as 2x.

We also know that the time difference between now and the time of Digimon's release is the same for both John and Jim. 

Since John is 28 now, we can set up the equation: 28 - 2x = x.

Solving for x, we get: 
28 = 3x
x = 28 / 3
x = 9.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a year, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this context, it's more logical to assume that the time difference is a whole number, so we'll round to the nearest whole number that makes sense in the context of the problem.

Let's try rounding to the nearest whole number that makes sense. If we round down to 9, we get a time difference of 19 years. If we round up to 10, we get a time difference of 20 years.

Since Digimon had its 20th anniversary, we can assume that the time difference is 20 years. 

Now, we can find Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release: 
Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release = x = 28 - 20 = 8.

Since we know Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release, we can find Jim's current age: 
Jim's current age = x + 20 = 8 + 20 = 28.

However, this would mean John and Jim are the same age now, which contradicts the given information. 

Let's try rounding down to 9 years. 
Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release = x = 28 - 9 = 19.

Jim's current age = x + 20 = 19 + 20 = 39.

This solution is more plausible, as it satisfies the given conditions.

The final answer is 39."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

Doxa ate 1 slice of the apple. 
Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices. 
Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, we add up the slices eaten by Doxa, her sister, and her brother: 
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

Therefore, they all ate 6 slices of apple.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the total number of bandages at the end of the first day is x - 38 + 50 = x + 12.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the second day is (x + 12) - 28 = x - 16.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages, which is 100 bandages, and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the third day is (x - 16) + 100 - 25 = x + 59.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation x + 59 = 78.

Solving for x, we get x = 19.

The initial length of her hair was 10 inches, and it ended at 8 inches. So, the length of hair cut is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch. Therefore, the cost of the haircut is 2 inches * $30 per inch = $60.

Adding the cost of the color, which is $40, the total cost of May's haircut and color is $60 + $40 = $100.

Total earnings from hourly rate = 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since Jen has complete attendance for the entire month, she will receive an additional $10 for each week, which is 4 weeks. 

Total attendance bonus = $10/week * 4 weeks = $40

Total earnings for April = Total earnings from hourly rate + Total attendance bonus = $270 + $40 = $310

Next, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80. Adding these to the previous total, we get 90 + 80 = 170.

Finally, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 40 people came in first, 3 * 40 = 120 more people entered. Adding these to the previous total, we get 170 + 120 = 290.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we find the number of fish with red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of fish with red stripes = Total number of fish / 3

= 22

Now, we need to find the number of fish that do not have red stripes. Since 22 fish have red stripes, the remaining fish are:

Remaining fish = Total number of fish - Number of fish with red stripes

Next, we are told that 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. We can calculate this as follows:

Number of fish with blue stripes = (5/11) * Remaining fish
= (5/11) * 44
= 20

Now, we need to find the total number of fish with both red and blue stripes. Since we already know that 22 fish have red stripes, and 20 fish have blue stripes, we can simply add these two numbers together:

Total number of fish with red and blue stripes = Number of fish with red stripes + Number of fish with blue stripes

"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know Mattison is 60 inches tall. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is, so the total height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, so the height of the first floor is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Since the total height of the house is 420 inches, and the first floor is 180 inches, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the second floor from the total height of the house. However, we need to subtract the height of the second floor from the height of the first floor to get the height from the ground to the second floor, then subtract that from the total height of the house.

The height from the ground to the second floor is 180 inches (first floor height). The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water removed by each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed by the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed by the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total amount of water removed by the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

"To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we first need to calculate the interest he owes. 

Stephen borrowed $300 and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed. The interest is 2% of $300, which is 0.02 * $300 = $6.

So, the total amount Stephen owes is $300 (initial amount) + $6 (interest) = $306.

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, the total amount he pays in those months is $25 * 11 = $275.

Now, to find out how much he will pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount he paid in the first 11 months from the total amount he owes: $306 - $275 = $31.

Therefore, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total volume of the jar and then determine the total number of jelly beans it can hold. 

The volume of the jar is calculated as the area of the base times the height. The base is a square with sides of 6 inches, so the area of the base is 6 * 6 = 36 square inches. The height is 15 inches. Therefore, the volume of the jar is 36 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, the actual volume of the jar that can be filled with jelly beans is 540 * 0.8 = 432 cubic inches.

Since a jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar is 432 / 0.15 = 2880.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the number of red jelly beans is 2880 * 0.3 = 864.

At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 of 40 is 30. So, 30 people entered at the second station. The total number of people on the bus now is 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of passengers doubled. This means the number of people on the bus is now 2 * 90 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the remaining spaces, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To calculate the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to break it down into two parts: the cost of the initial 5 years and the cost of the additional 3 years.

Initially, the cost of one visit was $2. After a 150% increase, the new cost of one visit is $2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5.

For the first 5 years, Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year, so the total cost for these 5 years is 5 * 3 * $2 = $30.

For the next 3 years, Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year, so the total cost for these 3 years is 3 * 3 * $5 = $45.

The total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is $30 + $45 = $75.

"To determine the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed and the time each group will take.

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

10 students per grade / 8 students per group = 1.25 groups per grade

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we'll round down to 1 group per grade. However, this would mean that some grades would not be able to participate. To accommodate all grades, we need to consider the total number of students across all grades.

There are 4 grades (4-7), and each grade has 10 students. So, the total number of students is:

4 grades * 10 students per grade = 40 students

Now, we can divide the total number of students by the number of students per group to find the total number of groups:

40 students / 8 students per group = 5 groups

Since each group takes 45 minutes, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is:

5 groups * 45 minutes per group = 225 minutes

Therefore, it will take 225 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

"To determine the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the tables and the cost of the roof frames separately and then add them together.

The cost of the tables is 4 tables * $20 per table = $80.
The cost of the roof frames is 2 frames * $10 per frame = $20.

The total cost is $80 (tables) + $20 (roof frames) = $100.

Ali has to pay John $100."
"To solve this problem, we can start by representing the length of the shorter piece as 'x'. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece can be represented as 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, so the sum of the lengths of the two pieces must equal 40 feet. We can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet, we can find the length of the longer piece by multiplying x by 4:

4x = 4(8) = 32 feet

Therefore, the longer piece is 32 feet long.

32"
"To determine the amount of seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of ground beef required to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide 80 by 16 to find the total pounds of meat needed.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of meat

Since Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, we can multiply the total pounds of meat by 2 to find the total amount of seasoning needed.

5 pounds of meat * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons of seasoning

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for the cookout.

"To determine the amount of fabric Luke needs, we first need to calculate the total width of the windows. Since there are five windows, each 35 inches wide, we multiply the number of windows by the width of each window.

Total width = Number of windows * Width of each window
Total width = 5 * 35
Total width = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2.

Total fabric needed = 2 * Total width
Total fabric needed = 2 * 175
Total fabric needed = 350 inches

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute, so the total cost is 16 * $0.25 = $4.

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.2 per minute, so the total cost is 20 * $0.2 = $4.

The total cost of the 36-minute call is the sum of these two costs: $4 + $4 = $8.

"To find the total inches of rain on Tuesday, we need to first calculate the total inches of rain on Monday, which is given as 2 inches. 

The problem states that it is expected to rain 1 more inch than twice of Monday's total on Tuesday. So, we need to calculate twice of Monday's total, which is 2 * 2 = 4 inches. 

Then, we add 1 more inch to this result, which gives us 4 + 1 = 5 inches.

Therefore, there will be 5 inches of rain on Tuesday.

"To solve this problem, we need to first express the relationship between the number of cupcakes and brownies Carly makes. Let's denote the number of cupcakes as 'c' and the number of brownies as 'b'. According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, so we can write the equation:

b = 3c - 2

We also know that Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats. This means the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10. Since the total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, we can write another equation:

c + b = 10

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the expression for 'b' from the first equation into the second equation:

c + (3c - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:

4c - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:

4c = 12

Divide both sides by 4:

c = 3

So Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"To calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with nail art, we first need to find the discounted price of the combined service. 

The basic manicure costs $35 and the basic pedicure costs $40. The total cost of both services without the discount is $35 + $40 = $75.

The salon offers a 20% discount for getting both services. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 20% (or 0.20). 

$75 * 0.20 = $15

The discounted price of the combined service is $75 - $15 = $60.

Now, we need to add the cost of nail art for each of the 10 nails (5 fingers and 5 toes). The cost of nail art is $3 per nail, so the total cost of nail art is $3 * 10 = $30.

The total cost of the manicure, pedicure, and nail art is $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of issues Susan receives from each magazine and then add them together.

The first magazine sends 12 issues a year. 
The second magazine sends 6 issues a year. 
The third magazine sends 4 times the amount of the second magazine, which is 4 * 6 = 24 issues a year.

Now, let's add the total number of issues from all three magazines: 
12 (first magazine) + 6 (second magazine) + 24 (third magazine) = 42 issues.

So, Susan receives 42 issues every year.

42"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as 'x'. 

Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, Shelley's paintings can be represented as x + 8.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, so Samantha's paintings can be represented as (x + 8) - 12.

We are given that Samantha has 27 paintings, so we can set up the equation:

(x + 8) - 12 = 27

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 4 = 27

Adding 4 to both sides, we get:

x = 31

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

"To find the price of the toy after the discounts, we need to calculate the price after each discount.

Initially, the price in November was $40.

In December, the price increased by 80%, so the new price is:
$40 + (80% of $40) = $40 + $32 = $72

In January, the price decreased by 50%, so the new price is:
$72 - (50% of $72) = $72 - $36 = $36

Therefore, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36.

"To calculate the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to first calculate the amount he earns from the standard rate lessons and the amount he earns from the lessons with veterans.

For the standard rate lessons, Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 per hour. So, the total amount he earns from these lessons is 4 * $80 = $320.

For the lessons with veterans, Charlie reduces his rate by 25%. This means his reduced rate is 75% of his standard rate, which is 0.75 * $80 = $60 per hour. He has 2 lessons at this rate, so the total amount he earns from these lessons is 2 * $60 = $120.

Now, we add the amounts from both types of lessons to find the total amount Charlie will make for the day: $320 + $120 = $440.

The final answer is: $440"
"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of scores.

First, let's add up the scores: 
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

There are 9 scores in total. 

Now, let's divide the sum by the total number of scores: 
630 / 9 = 70

The mean score is 70."
"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to first determine how many pomelos she had after giving some away. Since she is left with 1/4 of the original amount, we can set up the equation:

Original amount - Pomelos given away = 1/4 of the original amount

Let's denote the original amount as x. Then, the equation becomes:

x - Pomelos given away = x/4

To find the number of pomelos given away, we can rearrange the equation:

Pomelos given away = x - x/4
= (4x - x)/4
= 3x/4

We know that Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos. So, we can substitute x = 20 into the equation:

Pomelos given away = 3x/4
= 3(20)/4
= 60/4
= 15

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

She has written 36 novels this year."
"To determine the percentage of the distance covered by Michael, we need to first calculate the total distance he covers in 3 days. 

Since Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr, in 3 days, he would cover a distance of:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 3 days * 24 hours/day
Distance = 50 * 3 * 24
Distance = 3600 km

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the distance covered by dividing the distance covered by the total distance between Alaska and Texas, and then multiplying by 100:

Percentage = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage = (3600 / 6000) * 100
Percentage = 0.6 * 100
Percentage = 60%

Therefore, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given.

First, we know that Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes. 

The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, with each pie requiring 12 grapes. So, the total number of grapes used by the mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

Since the total number of grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and the mother is 36 + 48 = 84 grapes, and we know that Madeline and her brother used 36 grapes, the initial number of grapes must be 84 + 36 = 120 grapes.

"To calculate the total cost of making macaroni and cheese, we need to first calculate the weekly cost. 

The pasta costs $1.00 per box, and Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, so the pasta cost per week is $1.00. 

The cheddar cheese costs $3.00, and the gruyere cheese costs twice that amount, which is $6.00. The total cheese cost per week is $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00. 

The total weekly cost is $1.00 (pasta) + $9.00 (cheese) = $10.00. 

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total yearly cost is $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

"To find the total time spent cleaning classrooms, we need to multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom. 

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours by dividing by 60.

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

The custodian works 8 hours a day. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we can divide the total time spent cleaning by the total hours worked and multiply by 100.

Percentage of day spent cleaning = (20 hours / 8 hours) * 100 = 250%

The custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning classrooms."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the capacity of each shelf and then calculate how many shelves Elly needs.

Let's denote the number of books the bottom shelf can hold as B, the middle shelf as M, and the top shelf as T.

We know that:
- M = 10 (since each middle shelf can hold 10 books)
- B = 2M (the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf)
- T = B - 5 (the top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf)

Substituting M = 10 into the equation for B, we get B = 2 * 10 = 20.

Substituting B = 20 into the equation for T, we get T = 20 - 5 = 15.

Now, we know the capacity of each shelf: 
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Middle shelf: 10 books
- Top shelf: 15 books

To find out how many shelves Elly needs, we need to divide the total number of books by the total capacity of the shelves. However, since the question asks for the number of bookcases, we need to consider that each bookcase has multiple shelves.

The total capacity of the shelves is 20 + 10 + 15 = 45 books.

To find out how many bookcases are needed, we divide the total number of books by the total capacity of the shelves: 110 / 45 ≈ 2.44.

Since we can't have a fraction of a bookcase, Elly needs 3 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"To find Rose's profit, we first need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

First, let's calculate the total cost. Since Rose bought five dozens of eggs, and each dozen costs $2.40, the total cost is:

5 * $2.40 = $12

Next, we need to find out how many eggs Rose has in total. Since one dozen has 12 eggs, five dozens have:

5 * 12 = 60 eggs

Rose will sell each egg for $1, so the total revenue will be:

60 * $1 = $60

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
= $60 - $12

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's on sale for $3.00 off. So, the discounted price is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can find the cost of each stick by dividing the discounted price by the number of sticks: $15.00 / 30 = $0.50 per stick.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents.

"To determine the minimum number of correct answers Audrey needs on the second test, we first need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly overall. 

Since she needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, and the total number of questions is 70 + 40 = 110, she needs to answer 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions correctly in total.

She has already answered 60% of 70 questions correctly on the first test, which is 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions. 

So, she needs to answer 77 - 42 = 35 questions correctly on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as 's' and the number of blueberry cubes as 'b'. We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can write the equation:

s + b = 116

We also know that the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so we can write another equation:

b = 5s - 4

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first one:

s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6s - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6s = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

s = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting s into the second equation:

b = 5s - 4
b = 5(20) - 4
b = 100 - 4
b = 96

"To calculate the total number of points Ara has scored, we need to multiply the number of games she has played by the number of points she scores per game. 

Since she has been playing 40 games every year for four years, we can calculate the total number of games as follows:

40 games/year * 4 years = 160 games

Since she scores 21 points per game, we can multiply the total number of games by the points per game:

160 games * 21 points/game = 3360 points

Therefore, Ara has scored a total of 3360 points in the four years.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Initially, Brendan had 10 marbles. He dropped half of them, which is 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. So, he was left with 10 - 5 = 5 marbles.

Then, he found 3 more marbles, bringing the total to 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.

However, he picked up one of the marbles and found it to be a bead, not a marble. So, he got rid of that one, leaving him with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

Therefore, Brendan ended up with 7 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, Jason gets one customer. This means that the conversion rate of telephone calls to customers is 1/25 or 0.04. 

Next, we know that for every two customers, one buys a car. This means that the conversion rate of customers to car sales is 1/2 or 0.5.

To find the conversion rate of telephone calls to car sales, we multiply the two conversion rates: 0.04 * 0.5 = 0.02. This means that for every 25 telephone calls, Jason gets 0.02 car sales.

Now, we know that Jason needs to sell 15 cars to earn his bonus. To find out how many telephone calls he needs to make, we can divide the number of cars he needs to sell by the conversion rate of telephone calls to car sales: 15 / 0.02 = 750.

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of flashlights and candles used by Brianna's family.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. There are 4 people and 2 flashlights for each person, so the total number of flashlights is 4 * 2 = 8.

Next, let's calculate the number of candles. There are 8 rooms, and half of them have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Half of 8 is 4, so there are 4 rooms with 4 small candles each and 4 rooms with 5 medium candles each.

The total number of small candles is 4 * 4 = 16. The total number of medium candles is 4 * 5 = 20.

Now, we can add the total number of flashlights and candles to get the overall total. The total number of flashlights is 8, and the total number of candles is 16 + 20 = 36.

So, Brianna's family is using 8 flashlights and 36 candles when the lights go out.

"To solve this problem, we need to break down the time it takes to complete each side of the Rubik's cube.

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so each takes 5 * 2 = 10 minutes.
- The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so each takes 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes.

Now, we need to add up the time it takes to complete all six sides:

5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

Therefore, it takes 30 minutes to complete the Rubik's cube.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the number of robots, helmets, and footballs. 

We know that there are 20 helmets, and the number of helmets is half the number of footballs. So, the number of footballs is twice the number of helmets, which is 20 * 2 = 40.

We also know that the number of robots is half the number of helmets. So, the number of robots is 20 / 2 = 10.

To find the total number of items, we add the number of robots, helmets, and footballs together: 10 (robots) + 20 (helmets) + 40 (football) = 70.

The total number of items Dominick saw is 70."
"To find the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, we need to first calculate the total number of minutes he spends on calls per day. 

Since he spends 6 hours per day on calls, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the hours to minutes: 
6 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes per day.

Now, we can divide the total minutes per day by the time it takes to deal with a single call (15 minutes) to find the number of calls per day:
360 minutes / 15 minutes per call = 24 calls per day.

Since Tim works 5 days a week, we can multiply the number of calls per day by 5 to find the total number of calls per week:
24 calls per day * 5 days per week = 120 calls per week.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings and then subtract the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

The time it takes for the old varnish to dry on one painting is 7 minutes. Therefore, the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings is 7 * 6 = 42 minutes.

The time it takes for the new varnish to dry on one painting is 12 minutes. Therefore, the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings is 12 * 6 = 72 minutes.

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time it would take for the old varnish from the time it would take for the new varnish: 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish.

"To determine the total amount of water Crista needs, we need to calculate the amount of water for each group of plants and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount of water for the 4 plants that need half a cup of water: 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups.

Next, we calculate the amount of water for the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water: 8 * 1 = 8 cups.

Now, we need to find out how many plants need a quarter of a cup of water. We know Crista has 20 plants in total, and we've already accounted for 4 + 8 = 12 plants. So, the number of plants that need a quarter of a cup of water is 20 - 12 = 8.

Now, we calculate the amount of water for these 8 plants: 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.

Finally, we add up the water needed for all the plants: 2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups.

Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it takes Phineas to hop on land and the time it takes him to swim in the water.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance is 200 yards. Therefore, the distance on land is 100 yards and the distance in water is also 100 yards.

The time it takes Phineas to hop on land is the distance on land divided by his hopping speed: 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes.

The time it takes Phineas to swim in the water is the distance in water divided by his swimming speed: 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes.

Since these two parts are independent of each other, we add the time it takes to hop on land and the time it takes to swim in the water to get the total time: 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Phineas 15 minutes to return home.

Since Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks and each box contains 8 sticks, we can divide 56 by 8 to find the number of boxes needed: 56 ÷ 8 = 7.

Now, we can multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box to find the total cost: 7 boxes * $2.00 per box = $14.00.

The final answer is: $14."
"To determine the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to calculate the cost of the main phone and the cost of the four additional phones.

The main phone costs $20. Since each additional phone costs twice as much as the main phone, the cost of each additional phone is $20 * 2 = $40.

The cost of the four additional phones is $40 * 4 = $160.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the four additional phones, which is $20 + $160 = $180.

"To determine how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in a month. Since June has 30 days, and he sells 10 dozen doughnuts per day, we can calculate the total number of doughnuts as follows:

10 dozen doughnuts per day * 30 days = 300 doughnuts per month

Since each doughnut is sold at $2, we can multiply the total number of doughnuts by the price per doughnut to find the total revenue:

300 doughnuts * $2 per doughnut = $600

Therefore, Derrick makes $600 in June if he sells all the doughnuts.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate John's new speaking speed after training. 

His original speed is 150 WPM, and after training, it becomes 2.5 times faster. 

New speed = 2.5 * original speed
New speed = 2.5 * 150
New speed = 375 WPM

Now, we need to calculate the total number of words John can speak in 1 minute. 

Since there are 60 seconds in 1 minute, we can calculate the number of words he can speak in 1 minute as follows:

Number of words in 1 minute = New speed * 60
Number of words in 1 minute = 375 * 60
Number of words in 1 minute = 22500

Now, we need to calculate the total number of words in 10 pages. 

Total words in 10 pages = Number of words in 1 minute * 10
Total words in 10 pages = 22500 * 10
Total words in 10 pages = 225000

Now, we can calculate the time it takes John to speak 10 pages as follows:

Time = Total words in 10 pages / New speed
Time = 225000 / 375
Time = 600 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60.

Time (in hours) = 600 / 60
Time (in hours) = 10 hours

Therefore, it would take John 10 hours to speak 10 pages.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people present on each day and then sum them up.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the number of people present is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the total number of people was twice the number present on the second day, so the number of people present is 2 * 70 = 140.

Since Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the rest of the week (4 days), the total number of people present on those days is 60 * 4 = 240.

Now, we can calculate the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week by adding the people from each day: 50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 400.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 400."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of kernels that popped during the entire process.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped. In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount popped, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels. 

In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increased to four times the initial rate, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped. 

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate decreased to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 80 / 2 = 40 kernels popped.

Now, let's calculate the total number of kernels that popped during the entire process: 
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels.

A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat. Since 40 kernels popped in the final 30 seconds, a quarter of that amount is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

The total number of kernels that popped is 200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

Therefore, Garrett has 210 pieces of popcorn to eat."
"To determine the total number of lemons needed, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for 5 gallons of lemonade. 

Since Tim needs 1 cup of lemon juice per gallon, he will need 5 cups of lemon juice for 5 gallons. 

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the total number of lemons needed for 5 gallons as follows:

5 cups / 1 cup per 6 lemons = 5 * 6 = 30 lemons

For the extra gallon that is twice as tart, we need to calculate the amount of lemon juice required. Since it's twice as tart, it will require half the amount of juice as the other gallons. 

So, for the extra gallon, we need 1/2 cup of lemon juice. 

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for the extra gallon as follows:

1/2 cup / 1 cup per 6 lemons = 1/2 * 6 = 3 lemons

Now, we add the lemons needed for the 5 gallons and the extra gallon:

30 lemons + 3 lemons = 33 lemons

Therefore, Tim will need 33 lemons in total.

"To determine the total amount of dog food needed for the week, we need to calculate the daily consumption of both breeds and then multiply it by 7.

The total daily consumption is the sum of the consumption of both breeds:
3 German Shepherds * 5 kg/day = 15 kg/day
2 Bulldogs * 3 kg/day = 6 kg/day
Total daily consumption = 15 kg/day + 6 kg/day = 21 kg/day

Now, we multiply the total daily consumption by 7 to get the weekly consumption:
21 kg/day * 7 days = 147 kg

The Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs, we need to calculate the total number of legs of all the animals and then divide by 2.

The 2-legged animals have 2 legs each, so 10 * 2 = 20 legs.
The 4-legged animals have 4 legs each, so 15 * 4 = 60 legs.

Now, we add the total number of legs: 20 + 60 = 80 legs.

To find the total number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2: 80 / 2 = 40.

The farm has 40 pairs of animal legs in total."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of blue and yellow blocks. Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, and there are 4 blue blocks, the number of yellow blocks is 2 * 4 = 8.

Now, we know that the total number of blocks is 32. We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Number of blue blocks + Number of yellow blocks + Number of red blocks = Total number of blocks
4 + 8 + x = 32

Subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation, we get:
x = 20

Therefore, there are 20 red blocks in the tower.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Elvis traveled and then determine the net distance from his house.

First, we calculate the distance Elvis traveled in each direction. Since he traveled at an average speed of 18mph for both parts of the journey, we can use the formula: distance = speed * time.

For the first part of the journey (west), the distance is 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles.

For the second part of the journey (east), the distance is also 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles.

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the net distance from his house. To do this, we subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east: 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles.

So, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house.

"To calculate the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and subtract it from the initial value.

Initial value of the boat: $9000

Year 1 depreciation: 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after Year 1: $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Year 2 depreciation: 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after Year 2: $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Year 3 depreciation: 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after Year 3: $4410 - $882 = $3528

The boat is worth $3528 after three years.

"To determine the number of pink candies, we need to first find the number of orange and yellow candies. 

We know there are 54 red candies. The bag has twice as many orange candies as red candies, so there are 2 * 54 = 108 orange candies.

The bag has half as many yellow candies as red candies, so there are 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies.

Now, we know the total number of candies in the bag is 232. We can subtract the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from this total to find the number of pink candies.

232 - 54 (red) - 108 (orange) - 27 (yellow) = 43

Therefore, there are 43 pink candies.

"To find the total cost of Helen's trip, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel and the bus trips separately and then add them together.

The cost of the hotel for 3 nights is $80 * 3 = $240.

The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel, which is $80 * 0.1 = $8. 

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus trips is $8 * 7 = $56.

The total cost of Helen's trip is the sum of the hotel cost and the bus trip cost, which is $240 + $56 = $296.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many marbles Dallas had initially. We know that Dallas dropped 4 marbles, so we can calculate the initial number of marbles Dallas had by adding the marbles he has now to the marbles he dropped.

Dallas has 21 marbles now, and he dropped 4, so he initially had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles.

Since Mazie gave the marbles to Dallas and Darla, and we know that Dallas initially had 25 marbles, we can calculate the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla by subtracting the initial number of marbles Dallas had from the total number of marbles Mazie had.

Mazie had 52 marbles, and Dallas initially had 25, so Mazie gave 52 - 25 = 27 marbles to Darla.

"To calculate the total weight of the car and its contents, we need to add the weight of the car, the luggage, and the children.

Weight of the car = 1200 pounds
Weight of the luggage = 250 pounds
Weight of the children = 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of its weight, we can calculate the force as follows:

Force = 1% of 1600 pounds = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

Therefore, John needs to push the car with a force of 16 pounds.

"To determine the amount of crepe paper James needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of the fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

Since the long side is 20 feet and the short side is 15 feet, the perimeter would be:

Perimeter = 2 * (long side + short side)
Perimeter = 2 * (20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2 * 35
Perimeter = 70 feet

Therefore, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to hang the streamers around his backyard fence.

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now, we can find the average of their ages by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

The average of their ages is 48."

The total number of good seashells they found together is 665."
"To determine the total cost of the place settings, we need to calculate the cost of each type of plate and then add them together.

For the dinner plates, Avery needs 12 plates at $6.00 each, so the total cost is 12 * $6.00 = $72.00.

For the bowls, she needs 12 bowls at $5.00 each, so the total cost is 12 * $5.00 = $60.00.

For the salad plates, she needs 12 plates at $4.00 each, so the total cost is 12 * $4.00 = $48.00.

Now, we add the costs of all three types of plates together: $72.00 + $60.00 + $48.00 = $180.00.

"To determine how much feed is left after a week, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by the pigs in one day. Since each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, the total feed consumed by one pig in a day is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

Since Dexter has five pigs, the total feed consumed by all pigs in a day is 5 * 8 = 40 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total feed consumed by all pigs in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so the total feed consumed by all pigs in a week is 40 * 7 = 280 pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so the amount of feed left after a week is 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

"To determine the total number of hot dogs needed, we first need to calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the guests. Since each guest will eat 2 hot dogs and there are 20 guests, the total number of hot dogs needed is 20 * 2 = 40.

However, John already has 4 hot dogs left over, so we need to subtract these from the total. The total number of hot dogs needed is 40 - 4 = 36.

Since a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs, we need to divide the total number of hot dogs needed by 6 to find out how many packs John needs to buy. 36 / 6 = 6.

Since John needs 6 packs of hot dogs, and each pack costs $2, the total cost will be 6 * 2 = $12.

"To calculate the total time spent on meditation and yoga practice, we need to break it down into two components: meditation and yoga.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, which is a total of 30 minutes per day. Since she does this for 7 days a week, the total time spent on meditation per week is 30 * 7 = 210 minutes.

She practices 1 hour (60 minutes) of yoga 5 days a week, so the total time spent on yoga per week is 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

To find the total time spent on both meditation and yoga per week, we add the two values: 210 + 300 = 510 minutes per week.

Since there are 4 weeks in the given period, we multiply the weekly total by 4: 510 * 4 = 2040 minutes.

Therefore, Charisma has spent 2040 minutes on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks.

3 dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 seeds

Now, we know that a large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find the number of seeds in a large sunflower, we need to calculate 50% of the seeds in a small sunflower and add it to the number of seeds in a small sunflower.

50% of 36 seeds = 0.5 * 36 = 18 seeds

"To determine Josh's weekly earnings, we need to calculate the number of days he is open in a week. Since he is open every day except Sunday and Wednesday, he is open 5 days a week. 

Since there are 7 days in a week, Josh's weekly earnings can be calculated as follows:

Weekly earnings = Number of days open per week * Number of cars serviced per day * Payment per car
Weekly earnings = 5 days/week * 3 cars/day * $4/car
Weekly earnings = 5 * 3 * 4
Weekly earnings = 60

To find Josh's earnings in 2 weeks, we multiply his weekly earnings by 2:

Earnings in 2 weeks = Weekly earnings * 2
Earnings in 2 weeks = 60 * 2
Earnings in 2 weeks = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"To determine the total number of cookies Randy has now, we need to calculate the number of cookies he had initially, subtract the number of cookies he ate, gave away, and then add the number of cookies he baked.

Initially, Randy had 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. 

He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. So, he ate 3 cookies in total. 
- Oatmeal cookies: 9 - 1 = 8
- Chocolate chip cookies: 4 - 1 = 3
- Sugar cookies: 5 - 1 = 4

He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. 
- Oatmeal cookies: 8 - 2 = 6
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3 (unchanged)
- Sugar cookies: 4 (unchanged)

He gave 2 sugar cookies to his friends. 
- Oatmeal cookies: 6 (unchanged)
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3 (unchanged)
- Sugar cookies: 4 - 2 = 2

He baked 4 of each flavor for dinner. 
- Oatmeal cookies: 6 + 4 = 10
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3 + 4 = 7
- Sugar cookies: 2 + 4 = 6

Randy now has 10 oatmeal cookies, 7 chocolate chip cookies, and 6 sugar cookies. 

The total number of cookies Randy has now is 10 + 7 + 6 = 23."
"To determine how much Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the total amount he would receive from the buyer for each half of his collection and then add those amounts together.

Since Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, he can divide them into two equal halves. Each half would have 6 toy soldiers.

For the first half, the buyer is willing to pay $5 per toy. So, for 6 toy soldiers, the buyer would pay 6 * $5 = $30.

For the second half, the buyer is willing to pay $7 per toy. So, for 6 toy soldiers, the buyer would pay 6 * $7 = $42.

To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we add the amounts from both halves: $30 + $42 = $72.

Therefore, Matthew would earn $72 if he agrees to the buyer's offer.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes created by the dog during Nate's vacation and then determine how many holes Nate fills per week.

Nate's dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, resulting in a total of 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

Nate then fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. This means that for every day Nate fills in 9 holes, the dog digs 6 holes, resulting in a net gain of 3 holes per day.

To find the number of days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes, we can divide the total number of holes by the net gain per day: 84 / 3 = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert the number of days to weeks by dividing by 7: 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

Therefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"To find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we need to first calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School. 

Since Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

Average enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * Average enrollment at Norman High School
= (3/4) * 4000
= 3000

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools:

Difference in average enrollment = Average enrollment at Norman High School - Average enrollment at Butler High School
= 4000 - 3000
= 1000

The average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 greater than the average enrollment at Butler High School."
"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Number of chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies made - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)
= 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

The Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, so Igor gathered half as many, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

We also know that Igor gathered two more Petri dishes than requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

The total number of items Igor gathered is 29, so we can set up the equation: T + B + P = 29.

We know that T = 8 and P = 16, so we can substitute these values into the equation: 8 + B + 16 = 29.

Simplifying the equation, we get B + 24 = 29.

Subtracting 24 from both sides, we get B = 5.

Since Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers, he must have lost 7 - 5 = 2 beakers.

The final answer is: 2"
"To determine the number of screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables. Since each table has 4 legs and each leg needs 2 screws, the total number of screws required for one table is 4 legs * 2 screws/leg = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws required is 8 screws/table * 4 tables = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, so the number of screws he will have left over is 40 - 32 = 8 screws.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand that the question is asking for the total number of eggs in both baskets. 

Since there are 10 eggs in the first basket and twice as many eggs in the second basket, we can calculate the number of eggs in the second basket by multiplying the number of eggs in the first basket by 2. 

So, the second basket has 10 * 2 = 20 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we add the number of eggs in the first basket (10) to the number of eggs in the second basket (20). 

10 + 20 = 30

Therefore, there are 30 eggs in both baskets put together.

"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount each girl raised and then add them together.

Alexandra raised $430.
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.
Sarah raised $300.

Now, let's add the amounts raised by each girl: 
$430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2080.

The total amount of money raised is $2080."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between Aaron and Vanessa's speeds and distances. Let's denote Aaron's speed as 'a' miles per minute and Vanessa's speed as 'v' miles per minute.

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, we can express this as a = 2v.

We also know that Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, so if Aaron runs 'x' miles, Vanessa runs 2x miles. Given that Vanessa ran 4 miles, we can set up the equation 2x = 4, which means x = 2 miles for Aaron.

Now, we know Aaron's speed is a = 2v and he ran 2 miles in 16 minutes. We can use the formula time = distance/speed to find Aaron's speed: 16 = 2 / a. Solving for 'a', we get a = 2 / 16 = 1/8 miles per minute.

Since a = 2v, we can now find Vanessa's speed: 2v = 1/8, so v = 1/16 miles per minute.

Now that we know Vanessa's speed, we can find the time she took to run 4 miles: time = distance/speed = 4 / (1/16) = 4 * 16 = 64 minutes.

The final answer is: 64"
"To determine the total amount of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total length of line required for the existing dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, the total length of line required is 200 * 3 = 600 feet.

The caretaker already has 6 feet of line, so we subtract this from the total required length to find out how much more he needs to buy: 600 - 6 = 594 feet.

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total.

"To determine the total weekly revenue, we need to calculate the daily revenue and then multiply it by the number of days the restaurant is open.

First, let's calculate the daily revenue:

- Meals: 6 reservations * 2 meals per reservation * $5 per meal = 6 * 2 * 5 = $60
- Wine: 6 reservations * $5 per bottle = 6 * 5 = $30
- Total daily revenue: $60 (meals) + $30 (wine) = $90

Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the total weekly revenue is:
$90 (daily revenue) * 2 (days open) = $180

The final answer is: $180"
"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to first calculate the total cost and the total selling price. 

The total cost of the watermelons is $80. Since the vendor sold all of them at a 25% profit, we can calculate the total selling price as follows:

Total selling price = Total cost + (Total cost * Profit percentage)
Total selling price = $80 + ($80 * 0.25)
Total selling price = $80 + $20
Total selling price = $100

Now, we can find the selling price of each watermelon by dividing the total selling price by the number of watermelons:

Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons
Selling price per watermelon = $100 / 50
Selling price per watermelon = $2

The fruit vendor sold each watermelon for $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Dora will turn 12 in 3 years. This means that currently, Dora is 12 - 3 = 9 years old.

We also know that James is twice as old as Dora, so James is 2 * 9 = 18 years old.

We are also given that John had a son when he was 19, and this son is James. Therefore, John is currently 18 + 13 = 31 years old (since James is 18 years old).

Now, we need to find the age of John's youngest son, who was born when John was 32. This means that John's youngest son is currently 31 - 32 + 1 = 0 years old (since John was 32 when the son was born).

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 0 + 3 = 3 years old.

The final answer is: 3"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of oranges each person can peel in an hour. 

First, we need to find out how many minutes are in an hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes, she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes, she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

Since they start at the same time, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 20 oranges and Jane will have peeled 15 oranges.

The difference between the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the total cost Mark paid, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the labor cost separately.

The cost of the radiator is 80% of the original price, which is 0.8 * $400 = $320.

The labor cost is 3 hours at $50 per hour, which is 3 * $50 = $150.

The total cost Mark paid is the sum of the cost of the radiator and the labor cost, which is $320 + $150 = $470.

The final answer is: $470"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of legs each type of animal has. Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs. 

Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'b'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so c + b = 20. We also know that the total number of legs is 70, so 2c + 4b = 70.

We can solve this system of equations by first multiplying the first equation by 2 to get 2c + 2b = 40. Then, we subtract this equation from the second equation to get 2b = 30. Solving for b, we find that b = 15. 

Now that we know the number of cows, we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find c. c + 15 = 20, so c = 5.

Therefore, Farmer Brown has 5 chickens.

"To determine the number of slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, we calculate the total number of slices: 7 pizzas * 8 slices per pizza = 56 slices.

Now, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people: 56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person.

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices.
