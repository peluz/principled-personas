"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first calculate how many eggs she has left after eating and baking.

She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 eggs for her friends, so she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs per day.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day, so she has 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left.

She sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg, so she makes 9 * 2 = $18 per day at the farmers' market.

"To find the total number of bolts, we need to add the blue and white fibers. 

The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 
It takes half that much white fiber, so it takes 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.

Now, we add the blue and white fibers: 2 + 1 = 3.

The total number of bolts is 3."
"To find the profit, we need to first find the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original price of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%. 

150% of $80,000 is 1.5 x $80,000 = $120,000. 

The new value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Josh spent $50,000 on repairs, so his profit is $200,000 - $50,000 = $150,000.

The final answer is: $150,000"
"To find the total meters James runs a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints he runs per week by the distance of each sprint.

He runs 3 sprints per week, and each sprint is 60 meters. 

3 sprints * 60 meters = 180 meters

So, James runs 180 meters a week."
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs for the final meal, we need to first find out how many cups of feed she has already given to her chickens. 

She gave 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. 
15 + 25 = 40 cups

Now, we need to find out how many cups of feed she needs for each chicken. 
She has 20 chickens and has already given 40 cups of feed. 
40 cups / 20 chickens = 2 cups per chicken

Since she has already given 2 cups to each chicken, she needs to give 2 more cups to each chicken for the final meal. 
2 cups * 20 chickens = 40 cups

So, Wendi needs 40 cups of feed for the final meal of the day.

40"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The first glass costs $5.

The remaining 15 glasses cost 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3 per glass.

So, the total cost of the remaining 15 glasses is 15 * $3 = $45.

The total cost of all 16 glasses is $5 + $45 = $50.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the number of sheep in Charleston, we need to multiply the number of sheep in Seattle by 4. 
Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Since Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we add the number of sheep in Seattle, Charleston, and Toulouse together. 
20 + 80 + 160 = 260

The total number of sheep is 260."
"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break it down into two parts: the first download and the second download.

First, Carla downloads 60% of the file (200 GB * 0.6 = 120 GB) at a rate of 2 GB/minute. So, the time taken for the first download is 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

Then, the system restarts and Carla has to download the remaining 80 GB (200 GB - 120 GB) at the same rate of 2 GB/minute. So, the time taken for the second download is 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

Adding the time taken for both downloads, we get 60 minutes + 40 minutes = 100 minutes.

The total time taken to download the file is 100 minutes.

"To find the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we need to break it down into parts.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

Then, he turns around and drives for 2 hours in standstill traffic. Since he's not moving, the distance remains the same, 180 miles.

Next, he drives for half an hour at 30 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.

After that, he drives for the remaining 2 hours at 80 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 2 = 160 miles.

Now, we add up all the distances: 180 + 180 + 15 + 160 = 535 miles.

So, John is 535 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To find Eliza's earnings for this week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are 40 * $10 = $400.

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so it's 1.2 * $10 = $12. Her overtime earnings are 5 * $12 = $60.

Her total earnings for the week are $400 + $60 = $460.

$460"
"To find the total downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

The first month had 60 downloads.

The second month had three times as many downloads as the first month, so it had 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

The third month had 30% fewer downloads than the second month. 30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. So, the third month had 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

Now, let's add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The total downloads over the three months is 366."
"To find the total cost, I need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

First, I'll calculate the cost of the donuts: 3 dozen donuts * $68 per dozen = 3 * 68 = $204.

Next, I'll calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes: 2 dozen cupcakes * $80 per dozen = 2 * 80 = $160.

Then, I'll calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen cheesecakes * $55 per dozen = 6 * 55 = $330.

Now, I'll add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the profit each year.

The cost to plant the tree is $90. Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons and he sells them for $1.5 each. So, the revenue from the lemons is 7 * $1.5 = $10.5 per year.

The cost to water and feed the tree is $3 per year. So, the net profit per year is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

To find out how many years it will take to break even, we need to divide the cost of planting the tree by the net profit per year. 

$90 / $7.5 = 12 years.

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. This means she has two-thirds of her original amount left.

Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, now she has two-thirds of her original amount minus 2.

After that, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. This means she sold half of two-thirds of her original amount.

Let's represent the original amount as 'x'. 

Two-thirds of 'x' is (2/3)x. 
Half of (2/3)x is (1/2)*(2/3)x = (1/3)x.

Now, we know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. This means (1/3)x - 2 = 5.

To find 'x', we need to solve the equation: (1/3)x - 2 = 5.

Adding 2 to both sides, we get (1/3)x = 7.

Multiplying both sides by 3, we get x = 21.

So, Melanie started with 21 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

20% of 20 students are enrolled in contemporary dance, which is 0.2 * 20 = 4 students.

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16.

25% of the remaining 16 students are enrolled in jazz dance, which is 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.

The number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 16 - 4 = 12.

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100.

(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the best choice, we need to calculate the future value of both options.

For the jewelry:
Initial value = $5,000
Market increase = 2.5%
Future value = $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,250

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial value = $8,000
Market increase = 1.2%
Future value = $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,160

Since the future value of the jewelry ($5,250) is less than the future value of the electronic gadgets ($8,160), the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit.

Profit = Future value of electronic gadgets - Initial value of electronic gadgets
= $8,160 - $8,000
= $160"
"So, the two trains are traveling westward for 80 miles each, and then they both travel northward for 150 miles. 

Since they are traveling in the same direction for the first 80 miles, we can't tell which train is which. But after that, they are traveling northward, so we can add the 150 miles to each train's total distance.

So, the total distance covered by each train is 80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles.

"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately, then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
$20 per hour * 35 hours per week = $700 per week
$700 per week * 50 weeks per year = $35,000 per year

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
$30 per hour * 15 hours per week = $450 per week
$450 per week * 50 weeks per year = $22,500 per year

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching:
$35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500

Her annual salary is $57,500."
"To find out how many eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week and then multiply it by 4.

She makes 3 eggs every morning, so in a week, she eats 3 eggs/day * 7 days = 21 eggs.

Now, we multiply 21 eggs by 4 weeks: 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide 84 eggs by 12 to get the number of dozens: 84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozen eggs.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total time Marissa has spent so far, we need to add the time she spent on the first 4 miles and the next 2 miles. 

She spent 1 hour on the first 4 miles and 1 hour on the next 2 miles. So, the total time spent so far is 1 + 1 = 2 hours.

The total distance she needs to cover is 12 miles. She has already covered 4 + 2 = 6 miles. 

The remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles.

To achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, the total time she needs to spend is 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours.

Since she has already spent 2 hours, she needs to spend 3 - 2 = 1 more hour to achieve her desired average speed.

To find the required speed for the remaining 6 miles, we divide the remaining distance by the remaining time. 

6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.

The final answer is 6."
"To find out how much water is in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in both drinks after adding them together and then subtract the spilled water.

First, let's calculate the amount of water in the orange drink. It's two-thirds of 10 liters, so that's (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 liters of water.

Next, let's calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink. It's three-fifths of 15 liters, so that's (3/5) * 15 = 9 liters of water.

Now, let's add the water from both drinks together: 20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = 49/3 liters of water.

We spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract that from the total amount of water: 49/3 - 1 = 46/3 liters of water.

To convert this to a decimal, we can divide 46 by 3: 46 ÷ 3 = 15.33 liters.

The final answer is 15.33."
"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to know how old Raymond is. Since Samantha is 31 and Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old.

Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract 23 from 25. 

25 - 23 = 2

Raymond's son was born 2 years ago."
"To find out how many DVDs Billy sold, we need to add up the number of DVDs each customer bought.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so that's 3 DVDs.
The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs.
The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs.

Now, let's add up the DVDs: 3 + 4 = 7.

Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"To find out how many centimeters the candle will be shorter, we need to know how many hours it burns. 

It burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is 4 hours. 

Since it melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply 4 hours by 2 centimeters per hour. 

4 * 2 = 8 centimeters

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the other items she ordered.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 x $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 x $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is $17 / $8.50 = 2.

For shoes: 3 pairs * $42 = $126

Now, let's add them together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243

Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items."
"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she will buy and then multiply that by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will eat 1 serving per day. In 60 days, she will eat 60 servings.

Each carton has 15 servings, so to find out how many cartons she will buy, we divide the total number of servings by the number of servings per carton:

60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Now, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton:

4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

So, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days."
"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance he traveled before his second stop. 

He traveled 20 miles before his first stop. 
Then, he traveled 15 miles before his second stop. 

So, the total distance before his second stop is 20 + 15 = 35 miles.

The total distance of the trip is 60 miles. 

To find the distance between his first and second stops, we subtract the distance before his second stop from the total distance of the trip. 

60 - 35 = 25 miles.

"To find the price of the boots, we need to first find the price of the two pairs of heels. 

One pair of heels costs $33. The other pair costs twice as much, so it costs 2 * $33 = $66.

The two pairs of heels together cost $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the boots and the two pairs of heels together cost the same amount, the boots must cost $99.

The final answer is: $99"
"To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we need to first find their current ages. 

Let's say Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x. 

Their total age is 162, so 7x + 11x = 162. 

Combine like terms: 18x = 162. 

Divide both sides by 18: x = 9. 

Now we know that Darrell's age is 7x = 7 * 9 = 63, and Allen's age is 11x = 11 * 9 = 99. 

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109."
"To find the average guess, we need to add up all the guesses and divide by the number of guesses.

The first guess is 80.
The second guess is 20 more than half of 80, which is 40. So, the second guess is 80 + 20 = 100.
The third guess is 25% more than 80, which is 80 + (25% of 80) = 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, let's add up all the guesses: 80 + 100 + 100 = 280.

There are 3 guesses, so we divide the sum by 3: 280 / 3 = 93.33.

The average guess is 93.33."

"To find out how many gold coins Gretchen has, we need to know how many silver coins she has. Let's say she has x silver coins. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, she has x + 30 gold coins.

We know that the total number of coins is 110. So, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 30) = 110.

Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 110.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, she has 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, we know that Raymond has 40 jewels.

Since Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, we need to find half of Raymond's jewels first. 
Half of 40 jewels is 40 / 2 = 20 jewels.

Now, we know Aaron has 5 more jewels than 20, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Since Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, we subtract 2 from Aaron's jewels to find Siobhan's jewels. 
25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the points he scored in the second 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4 points, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which is 1 point. 

So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in both periods: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

Therefore, Mike scored a total of 9 points.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. In 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The sale is 4 yogurts for $5.00. So, the cost of one yogurt is $5 / 4 = $1.25.

Now, we multiply the total number of yogurts by the cost of one yogurt: 60 * $1.25 = $75.

"To find out how much money John had initially, we need to calculate the total amount he got from selling his lego sets. 

He sold 13 lego sets for $15 each, so he got 13 x 15 = $195.

He spent $20 on 8 video games, so he spent 8 x 20 = $160.

He had $5 left after buying the video games. 

To find out how much he spent on the video games, we subtract the amount he had left from the amount he got from selling the lego sets: 195 - 160 = $35.

Now, we need to find out how many lego sets he sold. We know he spent $35 on video games, so we need to divide that by the price of each lego set, which is $15. 

35 ÷ 15 = 2.33

Since you can't sell a fraction of a lego set, we round down to 2. 

So, John sold 2 lego sets. 

He initially had 13 lego sets, and he sold 2, so he still has 13 - 2 = 11 lego sets."
"To find John's speed, we need to first find out how many hours he runs in a week. 

He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. Half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours. So, he runs 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours in total.

Since he runs 6 hours in 3 days, we can divide the total hours by the number of days to find his daily running time: 6 hours / 3 days = 2 hours per day.

Now, we can find his weekly running distance: 60 miles / 2 hours = 30 miles per hour.

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how fast Dana can run and walk. 

Since Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour and skipping is half as fast as running, she can run at 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. 

She runs for 1/3 of 6 hours, which is 2 hours. 

She walks for 2/3 of 6 hours, which is 4 hours.

In 2 hours, Dana can run 2 * 6 = 12 miles. 

In 4 hours, Dana can walk 4 * 3 = 12 miles.

So, in 6 hours, Dana can run 12 miles and walk 12 miles. 

The total distance Dana can travel in 6 hours is 12 + 12 = 24 miles.

First, we need to find the total number of pieces. Since Grandma Jones baked 5 pies and each pie was cut into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is 5 x 8 = 40.

Now, we subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces. 40 - 14 = 26.

So, the guests took 26 pieces of pie."
"To find out how many grams you can eat, first, we need to find out how many calories you can still consume. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 and you've already consumed 1800 calories. So, you can still consume 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since a serving has 250 calories, we need to find out how many servings you can have with 200 calories. 

200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings

Since you can have 0.8 servings, and each serving is 5 grams, you can have 0.8 * 5 = 4 grams."
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells 20 candles at $2.00 each, so the total revenue is:
20 candles * $2.00 = $40.00

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks for each candle, so for 20 candles, he needs:
20 candles * 1 pound = 20 pounds of beeswax
Since he needs 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks for each candle, the total cost is:
20 pounds * $10.00 = $200.00

Now, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit:
$40.00 - $200.00 = -$160.00

The net profit is -$160.00, meaning Charlie is losing $160.00."
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and multiply it by the time it takes to write one article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, so she wrote 5 + (2/5 * 5) = 5 + 2 = 7 articles.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, so she wrote 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's add up the total number of articles: 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since it takes 4 hours to write one article, the total number of hours spent writing articles is 26 * 4 = 104 hours.

"To find out how many blue ties John bought, we need to divide the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie. 

$200 / $40 = 5 blue ties

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the blue tie, so it's $40 + ($40 * 0.5) = $60.

The total cost of the red ties is 10 * $60 = $600.

The total amount spent on ties is $200 (blue ties) + $600 (red ties) = $800.

"To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained, we need to divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece. 

First, we need to convert the total length of the wire from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 4 feet is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we can divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches). 

48 ÷ 6 = 8

So, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units, we need to first find the total number of units in the building. 

There are 15 floors, and each floor has 8 units. So, the total number of units is 15 * 8 = 120 units.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is 3/4 * 120 = 90 units.

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units: 120 - 90 = 30 units.

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to first find out how many eggs he sells per week. 

He sells 252 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week, so he sells 252 * 7 = 1764 eggs per week.

Since he sells eggs by the dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens he sells per week. 1764 / 12 = 147 dozen eggs per week.

He sells each dozen for $2, so he makes 147 * 2 = $294 per week."
"To find the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to first find the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. 

Since he travels at 10 mph, the distance he traveled is 3 hours. 

Now, to find the time it takes for him to get back, we divide the distance by his speed. 

Time = Distance / Speed 
Time = 3 hours / 6 mph 
Time = 0.5 hours 

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 0.5 hours to minutes. 
0.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 30 minutes 

So, it takes Tom 30 minutes to get back.

"To find out how many pounds Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he's removing. 

Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he's removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total. So, the weight of the toys he needs to remove is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can find out how many toys he needs to remove by dividing the weight of the toys by the weight of each toy. 

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

"To find out which day had the higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
6 truck tires * $60 = $360
4 car tires * $40 = $160
Total revenue on Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and 0 truck tires.
12 car tires * $40 = $480
Total revenue on Friday = $480

Since $480 is greater than $520, the mechanic earned more revenue on Friday.

The difference in revenue between the two days is $480 - $520 = -$40. 

The mechanic earned $40 less on the day with higher revenue."
"So, the Doubtfire sisters adopted 7 kittens. Patchy, the first cat, had thrice the number of adopted kittens, which means Patchy had 3 * 7 = 21 kittens. Trixie had 12 kittens. To find the total number of kittens, we need to add the number of kittens from both cats. 21 + 12 = 33. The Doubtfire family now has 33 kittens.

33"
"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to first find out how many lollipops are left after Jean eats 2. 

Jean had 30 lollipops initially. After eating 2, he has 30 - 2 = 28 lollipops left.

Since Jean wants to put 2 lollipops in each bag, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by 2.

28 ÷ 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with lollipops.

14"
"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to subtract the cost of the ticket and popcorn from the total amount of money he has.

Cost of ticket and popcorn: $7 + $7 = $14
Total money Peter has: $42

Now, let's divide the total money by the cost of the ticket and popcorn: $42 ÷ $14 = 3

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week."
"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit, then divide the result by the weight of a single box.

First, subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit:
5000 - 3755 = 1245

Now, divide the result by the weight of a single box:
1245 / 15 = 83

The maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 83.

The final answer is: 83"
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to calculate the total amount of the extra fees first. 

The 25% fee is 25% of $40.00. 
25% of $40.00 is 0.25 x $40.00 = $10.00. 

The total extra fees are $10.00 (25% fee) + $3.00 (delivery fees) = $13.00.

Now, we add the extra fees to the original bill: $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00.

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip: $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to add the number of clusters and the individual fruit. 

First, we multiply the number of clusters by the number of fruit in each cluster: 
6 clusters * 20 fruit per cluster = 120 fruit

Then, we add the individual fruit: 
120 fruit + 67 fruit = 187 fruit

There are 187 raspberries total."
"To find the number of good oranges, we need to first find the total number of oranges that are not good. 

There are 1 bad, 20% unripe, and 2 sour oranges. 

20% of 25 is 0.2 * 25 = 5. So, there are 5 unripe oranges. 

Now, we add the bad and sour oranges: 1 + 2 = 3 oranges that are not good. 

The number of good oranges is 25 - 3 = 22."
"To find the total amount Janet paid, we need to add the cost of the material and the cost of construction. 

$500 (material) + $800 (construction) = $1300

Then, we need to calculate 10% of $1300 to get the insurance cost.

10% of $1300 = 0.1 * $1300 = $130

Now, we add the insurance cost to the total cost.

$1300 + $130 = $1430

So, Janet paid $1430 in total."
"To find Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to calculate the total amount she receives in the first 20 years and the amount she receives in the next 10 years.

In the first 20 years, she receives a fixed annual pension of $50,000. So, the total amount she receives in the first 20 years is 20 x $50,000 = $1,000,000.

After 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. The value of the pension after 20 years is $1,000,000. So, the annual pension she receives after 20 years is 5% of $1,000,000, which is $50,000.

Now, we need to find the value of the pension after 30 years. The value of the pension after 20 years is $1,000,000, and she receives 5% of this value per year. So, the annual pension she receives after 20 years is $50,000. 

To find the value of the pension after 30 years, we need to add the annual pension she receives after 20 years to the value of the pension she receives in the next 10 years. The value of the pension she receives in the next 10 years is 10 x $50,000 = $500,000. 

So, the total value of the pension after 30 years is $1,000,000 + $500,000 = $1,500,000. 

Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years is 5% of $1,500,000, which is $75,000.

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break it down into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid $140 per month. There are 6 months in a half year, so she paid 6 x $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charged her 10% less money. 10% of $140 is $14, so the company charged her $140 - $14 = $126 per month. There are 6 months in the second half of the year, so she paid 6 x $126 = $756.

Now, we add the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year: $840 + $756 = $1596.

The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the total capacity of her tank by the amount of gas she used to fill it up.

First, we need to find out how much gas is left in the tank. Since she used 4 gallons to fill it up, and the tank holds 12 gallons, we subtract 4 from 12 to get 8 gallons left in the tank.

Now, we know that Sophia has already traveled 100 miles since the last fill-up. To find out how many miles she can drive on a single tank, we need to divide the remaining gas in the tank (8 gallons) by the miles she has already traveled (100 miles).

8 gallons / 100 miles = 0.08 miles per gallon

So, Sophia can drive 0.08 miles per gallon."
"To find out how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total hours spent on each activity per week and then multiply it by 4.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV per session. He does this 3 times a week, so the total hours spent on TV per week is 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

He reads for half as long as he watches TV, so he reads for 2 / 2 = 1 hour per session. He does this 3 times a week, so the total hours spent on reading per week is 1 * 3 = 3 hours.

The total hours spent on TV and reading per week is 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

In 4 weeks, Jim spends 9 * 4 = 36 hours on TV and reading."
"To find the total number of people, we need to calculate the number of players and coaches separately.

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players. So, each school has 2 * 5 = 10 players.

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of players is 10 * 4 = 40.

Each school has 1 coach, so the total number of coaches is 4.

The total number of people is the sum of players and coaches, which is 40 + 4 = 44.

"To find the total number of gems, we need to know the number of emeralds. We know there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, so the number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140. 

Since there are twice the number of emeralds than rubies, the number of emeralds is 140 * 2 = 280. 

Now, we add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds together: 175 + 140 + 280 = 595.

The total number of gems in the chest is 595."
"To find the number of teachers, we need to first find the total number of students. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, there must be 60 * 2 = 120 boys. 

The total number of students is 60 (girls) + 120 (boys) = 180.

Since there are 5 students to every teacher, we divide the total number of students by 5 to find the number of teachers. 

180 / 5 = 36

There are 36 teachers."
"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to subtract the total amount of her weekly allowance from the total amount she has at the end of 8 weeks.

"To find out how much Shiela will pay each month, we need to calculate the total cost of the cell phones and then add the interest.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the cell phones:
5 cell phones * $150 each = $750

Now, let's calculate the interest for each unit:
$150 * 2% = $150 * 0.02 = $3

Since there are 5 units, the total interest is:
$3 * 5 = $15

Now, let's add the total cost and the total interest:
$750 + $15 = $765

To find out how much Shiela will pay each month, we need to divide the total amount by 3:

"To find the average square footage of a level, we need to find the total square footage of all levels and divide it by the number of levels.

The top level has 16 square footage. Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, the second level will have 16 / 2 = 8 square footage, the third level will have 8 / 2 = 4 square footage, and the fourth level will have 4 / 2 = 2 square footage.

Now, let's add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30.

There are 4 levels, so we divide the total square footage by 4 to find the average: 30 / 4 = 7.5.

The average square footage of a level is 7.5."
"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food she will use in the first year.

In the first 180 days, she feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, in 180 days, she will use 180 cups of dog food.

After that, she feeds the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day. There are 365 days in a year, so she will use 2 cups/day * 365 days = 730 cups of dog food in a year.

Total dog food used in the first year = 180 cups + 730 cups = 910 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we can divide the total amount of dog food used in the first year by 110 cups to find out how many bags she will use.

910 cups / 110 cups per bag = 8.27 bags.

So, Cecilia will use approximately 9 bags of dog food in the first year.

"To find out how many games they won, we need to know how many they lost. Let's say they lost x games. Since they won 8 more than they lost, they won x + 8 games. 

We know they played 22 games in total. So, the sum of the games they won and lost is 22. 

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms: 
2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 
2x = 14

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how fast Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles. 

Let's say Gerald's original speed is x. Since Lee used to be able to run 2 seconds faster than Gerald, Lee's speed is x + 2. 

We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. Since speed is distance/time, we can set up the equation: 400 / (x + 2) = 38. 

Now, we can solve for x: 400 = 38(x + 2). 

Expanding the equation, we get 400 = 38x + 76. 

Subtracting 76 from both sides, we get 324 = 38x. 

Dividing both sides by 38, we get x = 8.42. 

Now that we know Gerald's original speed, we can find his new speed with the improved diet. Since his speed improved by 10%, his new speed is 1.1x.

So, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 9.22 seconds."
"To find the total number of pets, we need to first find the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, we multiply the number of dogs by 2 to get the number of cats. 

60 * 2 = 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we add the number of dogs and cats, then subtract 12.

60 + 120 = 180
180 - 12 = 168

There are 168 rabbits. 

Now, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits to get the total number of pets.

60 + 120 + 168 = 348

The total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we need to first find the total number of girls. 

Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 are girls. 
Total students = 200
Number of girls = 3/5 * 200 = 120

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 
Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
= 120 - 80

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to first find out how many ounces of tomatoes she used. Since she lost half of the volume, she used half of the 32 ounces of sauce. 

Half of 32 ounces is 32 / 2 = 16 ounces. 

Since each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces and 3 tomatoes, we divide 16 ounces by 16 to find out how many cans she used. 

16 / 16 = 1 can. 

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we multiply 1 can by 3 to find out how many tomatoes she used. 

1 * 3 = 3 tomatoes."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cars were in the line when the first 15 minutes were over. 

Let's assume the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is x. 

Then, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes is 20. 

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is x + 20. 

We know that 5 cars took an exit, so the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25. 

So, we can set up the equation: x + 20 = 25. 

Solving for x, we get x = 5. 

Therefore, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we need to first calculate the total number of potted plants she already has. 

She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so the total number of potted plants is 2 * 40 = 80.

She is giving 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family, so she will give away 40 potted plants.

To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we subtract the number of potted plants she gave away from the total number of potted plants she had: 80 - 40 = 40.

Mary will have 40 potted plants left."
"So, the fourth friend pressed on the doorbell 60 times. The third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed on the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times. The second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend, so the second friend pressed on the doorbell 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times. The first friend pressed on the doorbell 20 times. 

Now, let's add up all the doorbell rings: 60 + 70 + 25 + 20 = 175."
"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read in total, we need to add up the pages from all the textbooks. 

4 pages (Science) + 20 pages (Social Studies) + 7 pages (History) + 8 pages (Geography) = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages, we subtract that from the total number of pages. 

39 pages - 15 pages = 24 pages

Now, we need to find out how many pages Solo needs to read on average in one day. We know he has 4 more days to complete the reading. 

24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the total time he watched on other days.

On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1-hour episodes, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1-hour and 30-minute episodes, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours.

So, the total time he watched on those days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since he watched 7 hours of TV in total, the time he watched on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes. 1.5 hours is 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched. 90 minutes divided by 30 minutes per episode is 3.

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30 minutes on Wednesday."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Let's say Henry baked x cookies last year. This year, he wants to make twice as many, so he wants to bake 2x cookies.

He actually baked 2x + 15 cookies, but then he dropped 5 cookies. So, the total number of cookies he has now is 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10.

We know that the total number of cookies he has now is 110. So, we can set up the equation 2x + 10 = 110.

To solve for x, we need to subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 100.

Then, we divide both sides by 2: x = 50.

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

The cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon is 10 x $3.00 = $30.00.

The cashback reward is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons, it's 10 x $0.20 = $2.00.

Now, subtract the cashback reward from the total cost: $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00.

The final answer is: $28.00"

"To find the profit, we need to calculate the total cost and total selling price of the lumber.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
10 boards * $10 per board = $100

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
5 boards * $16 per board = $80

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
$100 + $80 = $180

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the new selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is:
$10 * 1.5 = $15 per board
$15 * 10 boards = $150

The new selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is:
$16 * 1.5 = $24 per board
$24 * 5 boards = $120

Now, let's calculate the total selling price:
$150 + $120 = $270

Finally, let's calculate the profit:
$270 - $180 = $90

The profit Sasha makes is $90."
"To find the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we need to find the value of one part of the ratio.

First, we know that there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each on the first day. So, the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles on the second day is 30. Since each container has 5 vehicles, we can divide 30 by 5 to find the total number of containers on the second day: 30 / 5 = 6.

Now, we subtract the number of containers on the first day from the number of containers on the second day to find the number of containers imported on the second day: 6 - 2 = 4.

The number of containers imported on the second day is 4."
"To find Adrien's salary four years later, we need to calculate his salary four years ago first. 

Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 30% four years ago, we can calculate his salary four years ago as follows:

$40,000 * 1.3 = $52,000

Now, we know that Adrien's salary four years later is 40% more than what he was making four years ago. 

$52,000 * 1.4 = $73,200

Now, we need to find Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can calculate Lylah's salary four years ago as follows:

$52,000 / 1.3 = $40,000

Now, we know that Lylah's salary four years later is 40% more than what she was making four years ago. 

$40,000 * 1.4 = $56,000

Combine like terms: 7Q = 700

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of worker bees: 4Q = 4 * 100 = 400

The final answer is: 400"
"If Jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day, that's 2 hours * 7 days a week = 14 hours a week. If he earns $10 an hour, then he would earn 14 hours * $10 an hour = $140 in a week."
"To find the total cost, first, I need to add up the cost of the food items. 

The food items are milk and eggs, which cost 2 + 3 = 5 dollars.

The non-food items are light bulbs, cups, and roach traps, which cost 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars.

Now, I need to calculate the tax on the non-food items. The tax is 10% of 10 dollars, which is 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar.

The total cost of the non-food items with tax is 10 + 1 = 11 dollars.

The total cost of everything is the cost of the food items plus the cost of the non-food items with tax, which is 5 + 11 = 16 dollars.

"To calculate the total expenses, we need to find out how many bottles of bleach and packs of cloths Kim will need. He has 3 clients now and 5 potential clients, so he will have 8 clients in total. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. 

Total bottles of bleach needed = 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed = 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

Total cost of bleach = 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
Total cost of cloths = 8 packs * $5/pack = $40

Total expenses = $32 + $40 = $72

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total income.
Profit = Total income - Total expenses
Profit = $92 - $72
Profit = $20

"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest in a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples in his field and then divide that by the number of harvests he can make in a year.

First, we calculate the total number of pineapples in the field:
10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, he can harvest 4 times in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest).

Now, we divide the total number of pineapples by the number of harvests:
1000 pineapples / 4 harvests = 250 pineapples per harvest

So, John can harvest 250 pineapples in each harvest.

The answer is: 1000"
"To find the total number of legos, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each box and add them together.

The first box has 500 pieces.

The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first one, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.

The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first one, so it has 1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the number of pieces in each box: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

So, Johnny picks up 2125 legos."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. Then, she sees 1/2 that many bees return in the next 6 hours. 

1/2 of 30 is 15, so 15 bees return in the next 6 hours.

Now, she sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave in the next 6 hours. Two times 30 is 60, so 60 bees leave the hive in the next 6 hours.

Now, we need to find out how many bees that left before that hadn't already returned. We already know 15 bees returned in the first 6 hours, so 30 - 15 = 15 bees left in the first 6 hours. Now, 60 bees left in the next 6 hours, so 15 + 60 = 75 bees left in total. 

Now, we need to find out how many bees return in the last 6 hours. We know 75 bees left, and 15 bees returned in the first 6 hours, so 75 - 15 = 60 bees left in the second 6 hours. Since 60 bees left in the second 6 hours, 60 bees return in the last 6 hours.

The answer is 60."
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets first. 

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and a child ticket is $10. Brittany's mom bought 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, so the total cost is $12 + $10 = $22.

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, she must have given the cashier $22 - $8 = $14.

So, Dorothy has 4 friends. James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, so we multiply Dorothy's friends by 4.

4 * 4 = 16

James has 16 friends on Facebook."
"To find out who wins, we need to calculate the time it takes for each person to get home. 

First, we need to convert the distance to the same units as the speed. Since the speed is given in feet per minute, we'll convert the distance to feet. 

Steve's distance is 3 miles, and there are 5280 feet in a mile, so Steve's distance is 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet. 

Tim's distance is 2 miles, so his distance is 2 * 5280 = 10560 feet.

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each person to get home. 

Time = Distance / Speed

For Steve: Time = 15840 / 440 = 36 minutes

For Tim: Time = 10560 / 264 = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve wins the race. 

The winner, Steve, will be waiting for the loser, Tim, to finish the race. To find out how long Steve will wait, we subtract the time it takes Steve to get home from the time it takes Tim to get home. 

Time Steve waits = Time Tim takes - Time Steve takes
Time Steve waits = 40 - 36
Time Steve waits = 4 minutes

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated and multiply it by the cost per tire.

There were 5 bicycles with 2 tires each, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 tires.
There were 3 tricycles with 3 tires each, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 tires.
There was 1 unicycle with 1 tire, so that's 1 tire.

In total, there were 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires inflated.

Each tire costs 25 cents, so the total amount of money made is 20 * 0.25 = 5 dollars.

Carl paid $6. Now, we need to find out how much change he should get back if he paid with a $10 bill. 

$10 - $6 = $4

Carl should get $4 as change."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Dave ate 14 fries. A seagull ate half of that, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries. So, the seagull ate 7 fries.

Now, Dave had 14 - 7 = 7 fries left. Then, 3 pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries. Now, Dave had 7 - 9 = -2 fries left. Since you can't have negative fries, this means the pigeons ate all the fries that were left after the seagull.

Now, a raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries. Since there were no fries left, the raccoon didn't steal anything.

Finally, ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 0 fries behind.

So, the pack had 1 fry left when Dave bought it.

"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the length of each type of baked good and add them together.

First, let's convert all the lengths to the same unit, feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

- Each roll is 4 inches long, which is 4/12 = 1/3 feet long.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long, which is 6/12 = 1/2 feet long.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- 300 rolls: 300 * 1/3 = 100 feet
- 120 croissants: 120 * 1/2 = 60 feet
- 60 baguettes: 60 * 2 = 120 feet

Now, let's add the lengths together: 100 + 60 + 120 = 280 feet.

The total length of the baked goods is 280 feet.

The gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 400 * 2 = 800 bananas.
The baboons need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, let's add up the total number of bananas needed: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran. 

Blake ran back and forth 15 times, so he ran 15 * 100 yards = 1500 yards.

Kelly ran back and forth once, which is 100 yards, and then she ran to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards. So, she ran 100 + 80 = 180 yards per round. She ran 34 times, so she ran 180 * 34 = 6120 yards.

Since 6120 yards is greater than 1500 yards, Kelly is the winner. 

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance: 6120 - 1500 = 4620 yards.

$450 + $300 + $750 = $1500

To find the yearly payment, we multiply the monthly payment by 12: 
$1500 * 12 = $18,000

The final answer is: 18000"
"To find the total time it takes Billy to peel and cut all the potatoes, we need to calculate the time for peeling and cutting separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time for peeling all the potatoes. Since it takes 1.5 minutes to peel one potato, and there are 60 potatoes, we multiply 1.5 minutes by 60 potatoes.

1.5 minutes * 60 potatoes = 90 minutes

Now, let's calculate the time for cutting all the potatoes. It takes 5 seconds to cut one potato, and there are 60 potatoes. We multiply 5 seconds by 60 potatoes.

5 seconds * 60 potatoes = 300 seconds

Now, we need to convert the time from seconds to minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we divide 300 seconds by 60.

300 seconds / 60 = 5 minutes

Now, we add the time for peeling and cutting together.

90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

"To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to first calculate how much they made from selling lemonade. 

They sell 20 glasses per gallon and each glass costs $0.50. So, they make 20 * $0.50 = $10 per gallon. 

They made $25 in profit, and since profit is the difference between revenue and cost, we can set up an equation: 

Revenue - Cost = Profit
(20 * $0.50) * number of gallons - (3 * number of gallons + 2 * number of gallons) = $25

Let's say the number of gallons is x. Then, 
$10x - (3x + 2x) = $25
$10x - 5x = $25
$5x = $25
x = 5

So, they made 5 gallons. 

Now, we can find the cost of lemons: 
Cost of lemons = 3 * 5 = $15

The final answer is 15."
"To find the number of Chinese people, we need to subtract the number of Japanese people from the total number of people. 

240 (total people) - 80 (Japanese people) = 160 (Chinese people)

Now, we know that the number of boys on the Chinese team was 60. To find the number of girls, we need to subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese people.

160 (Chinese people) - 60 (Chinese boys) = 100 (Chinese girls)

The answer is 100."
"To find out how much Zaid has left, we need to calculate his expenses and donations first.

Zaid earns 6000$ per month. 

He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 * 6000 = 1500$.

He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 1/3 * 6000 = 2000$.

The total amount spent so far is 1500 + 2000 = 3500$.

The remaining amount is 6000 - 3500 = 2500$.

He donates half of the remaining amount to charity, which is 1/2 * 2500 = 1250$.

The amount left after donation is 2500 - 1250 = 1250$.

He gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$, so the total amount given away is 200 + 700 = 900$.

The amount left after giving to his family is 1250 - 900 = 350$.

So, Zaid will have 350$ left."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Bo has 40 crabs. 
Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs. 
Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs. 
The total number of crabs the three have together is 40 + 36 + 46 = 122."
"To find out how much Lloyd earned, we need to multiply the number of hours he worked by his hourly wage.

For the first week, he worked 5 hours and earned 5 x $10 = $50.

For the second week, he worked 8 hours and earned 8 x $10 = $80.

To find the total amount he earned, we add the earnings from both weeks: $50 + $80 = $130.

The final answer is 130."
"To find the number of votes the loser got, we need to subtract the number of votes the winner got from the total number of votes.

The winner got 3/4 of the votes, so we need to find 1/4 of the total votes to find the loser's votes.

1/4 of 80 is 80 / 4 = 20

So, the winner got 3/4 * 80 = 60 votes.

The loser got 80 - 60 = 20 votes.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many red roses Sandra originally ordered. 

We know that Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. So, the number of white carnations is 200 / 5 = 40.

We also know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. So, the number of red roses is 4 * 40 = 160.

Since Sandra has threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm, we need to find out how many red roses Fred must deliver by 5 pm. 

The answer is 160."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know Jan is 30 years old.

Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. 
Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 30 / 2 = 15. 
So, two years ago, Mark was 15 + 5 = 20 years old.

Now, we know Mark is 2 years older than Jean. 
So, Jean's age would be 20 - 2 = 18 years old.

The final answer is 18."
"To find out how long it takes the less well-rounded team to complete the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for each of their runners to complete their leg of the race.

The first runner takes 60 seconds. 
The second runner will be 3 seconds faster, so they take 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner will be 3 seconds faster than the second runner, so they take 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner will be 3 seconds faster than the third runner, so they take 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Now, we add up the time it takes for each runner to complete their leg of the race: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The well-rounded team takes 55 * 4 = 220 seconds to complete the race.

The difference in time between the two teams is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of two events. 

First, let's calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. 

Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5

Now, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. There are 3 even numbers (2, 4, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. 

Probability of rolling an even number = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5

Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row = (Probability of rolling an even number) * (Probability of rolling an even number) 
= 0.5 * 0.5 
= 0.25

Now, we need to find the difference between the two probabilities. 

Difference = Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 - Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row 
= 0.5 - 0.25 
= 0.25

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100. 

Percentage difference = 0.25 * 100 
= 25%

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 25% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

"Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, so she picked 20 / 2 = 10 apples. 

They both picked 20 (mom) + 10 (Jenna) = 30 apples."
"To find out how many rats are in each cage, we need to first find out the total number of straw used for the hamsters and the rabbits. 

The hamsters have 10 cages, each with 5 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw used for hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50. 

The rabbits have 20 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw used for rabbits is 20.

The total number of straw used for hamsters and rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70.

Now, we know that the total number of straw used for all the small rodents is 160. Since the hamsters and rabbits used 70 pieces of straw, the remaining straw must be used for the rats. 

So, the number of straw used for rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we can find the number of rats by dividing the total number of straw used for rats by 6. 

Number of rats = 90 / 6 = 15.

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, we can find the number of rats in each cage by dividing the total number of rats by 3.

Number of rats in each cage = 15 / 3 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how much Mandy should give to Benedict, we need to calculate the interest she owes. 

The formula for simple interest is: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

In this case, Principal = $100, Rate = 2% or 0.02, and Time = 3 months.

Interest = $100 * 0.02 * 3
Interest = $6

So, Mandy owes Benedict $6 in interest. To pay off the debt, she should give Benedict $100 (the principal) + $6 (the interest) = $106.

"To find out how many bags the trader sold, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

Let's say the trader bought x bags of wheat.

The total cost of buying the bags is 20x dollars.

The cost of transporting the bags is 2x dollars.

The total cost is 20x + 2x = 22x dollars.

The total revenue from selling the bags is 30x dollars.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost, which is 30x - 22x = 8x dollars.

We know that the profit is $400, so we can set up the equation:

8x = 400

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8:

x = 400 / 8
x = 50

So, the trader bought 50 bags of wheat.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much they spent on food, we need to subtract $4.50 from the cost of the tickets. 

$20.25 (tickets) - $4.50 (food) = $15.75 (food)

Now, we need to add the cost of the rides to the total cost. 

$20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $33 (rides) = $69

Since there are 3 friends, we need to divide the total cost by 3 to find out how much each of them paid.

$69 ÷ 3 = $23

The final answer is 23."
"To find out how many peaches John collects, we need to multiply the number of minutes he collects peaches by the number of peaches he can collect per minute. 

First, we need to convert 3 hours into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is 3 x 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, we multiply the number of minutes by the number of peaches collected per minute. 180 minutes x 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches.

The answer is 360."
"To find out how many pounds of insects the ducks need per day, we need to divide the total amount of insects they need per week by 7. 

First, we need to convert 3.5 pounds to a decimal by dividing by 10 (since there are 10 in a ten). 3.5 ÷ 10 = 0.35 pounds per duck per week.

Now, we multiply 0.35 pounds by 10 ducks. 0.35 * 10 = 3.5 pounds per week.

Now, we divide 3.5 pounds by 7 days. 3.5 ÷ 7 = 0.5 pounds per day.

The answer is 0.5."
"Tom starts with 50 trees. He plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year. So, he has 10 - 2 = 8 more trees each year. 

After 10 years, he has 50 + (10 * 10) - (2 * 10) = 50 + 100 - 20 = 130 trees.

Then, 30% of the trees die. 30% of 130 is 0.3 * 130 = 39. So, 39 trees die.

Tom has 130 - 39 = 91 trees left.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pink and white flamingos are out at noon on Sunday.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. So, there were 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos left.

Then, they painted 6 flamingos white and put them back out. Now, there are 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

On Sunday, they added 18 more pink flamingos. So, there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

To find out how many more pink flamingos are out than white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards. Now she has 80 + 40 = 120 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokémon cards she collected in the first and second months, which is 2 * (20 + 60) = 2 * 80 = 160 cards. Now she has 120 + 160 = 280 cards.

The total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has now is 280."

Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, Mark earns:

500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A, so it pays 10 cents per sentence. For 500 sentences, Mark earns:

500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we add the earnings from both publishers:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that twenty dozen cups is equal to 20 x 12 = 240 cups.

We also know that half a dozen plates is equal to 6 plates.

The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of half a dozen plates is 1200 more than the cost of twenty dozen cups.

Let's denote the cost of one cup as 'x'. The total cost of twenty dozen cups is 20x.

The total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * 6000 = 36000.

Since the total cost of half a dozen plates is 1200 more than the cost of twenty dozen cups, we can set up the equation:

20x + 1200 = 36000

Now, let's solve for x:

20x = 36000 - 1200
20x = 34800
x = 34800 / 20
x = 1740

So, the cost of one cup is $1740.

The final answer is: 1740"

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of red chickens is 'r' and the number of white chickens is 'r + 2'. 

Since the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, the total number of eggs collected is 3r + 5(r + 2). 

We know that Jerry collects 42 eggs a day, so we can set up the equation:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park. The perimeter of a rectangle is the distance around the outside of the rectangle. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2 * (length + width). 

In this case, the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles. 

Perimeter = 2 * (6 + 1.5) 
Perimeter = 2 * 7.5 
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we need to divide the perimeter by Gary's walking speed to find out how many hours he spends walking.

The number of customers on the second day is 225 + 50 = 275. 
The number of customers on the third day is 500."
"Let's break this down step by step. 

Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the small pool lost 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons in 4 minutes. The big pool also lost 16 gallons in 4 minutes.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, the big pool has 4x gallons of water now. Since the big pool lost 16 gallons, it has 4x - 16 gallons now.

We know that the big pool has 4x - 16 gallons now, and it has 4 times as much water as the small pool. So, the small pool has (4x - 16) / 4 gallons of water now.

We also know that the small pool lost 16 gallons in 4 minutes. So, the small pool had x + 16 gallons 4 minutes ago. Since the small pool has (4x - 16) / 4 gallons of water now, we can set up the equation:

x + 16 = (4x - 16) / 4

Simplifying the equation, we get:

4x + 64 = 4x - 16

Subtracting 4x from both sides, we get:

64 = -16

This is not possible, so there must be an error in our assumption. Let's re-evaluate the situation.

Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the small pool lost 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons in 4 minutes. The big pool also lost 16 gallons in 4 minutes.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, the big pool has 4x gallons of water now. Since the big pool lost 16 gallons, it has 4x - 16 gallons now.

We know that the big pool has 4x - 16 gallons now, and it has 4 times as much water as the small pool. So, the small pool has (4x - 16) / 4 gallons of water now.

We also know that the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since the small pool lost 16 gallons in 4 minutes, it has x - 16 gallons now.

Since the big pool has 4 times as much water as the small pool, we can set up the equation:

4x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

4x - 16 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 4x from both sides, we get:

This is still not possible, so there must be an error in our assumption. Let's re-evaluate the situation.

Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the small pool lost 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons in 4 minutes. The big pool also lost 16 gallons in 4 minutes.

"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to add the cost of the shoes and the belt. 

$320.00 (shoes) + $32.00 (belt) = $352.00

Now, we need to divide the total cost by her hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work.

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

She needs to work 44 hours to make her purchase."
"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we need to first calculate the total amount she needs to pay back. 

She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. 
10% of $2000 is 0.1 x $2000 = $200. 
So, the total amount she needs to pay back is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

She will pay $165 a month for 12 months. 
Total amount paid = $165 x 12 = $1980.

Now, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount she needs to pay back to find the remaining balance.
Remaining balance = $2200 - $1980 = $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"To find the total number of flowers, we need to add the number of roses and dahlias. 

There are 4 roses.

"To find the current ages of Adrian and Zack, we need to calculate their ages based on the information given.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, we can find Zack's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 2. 
Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 * 21
Zack's age = 42

Now, since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, we can find Adrian's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 3.
Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 * 21
Adrian's age = 63

To find the average age of the three in three years, we need to add their ages in three years and divide by 3. 
In three years, Harriet's age will be 21 + 3 = 24, Zack's age will be 42 + 3 = 45, and Adrian's age will be 63 + 3 = 66.

Average age = (Harriet's age + Zack's age + Adrian's age) / 3
Average age = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know that the total points scored by the four students is 251. We can subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total to find out how many points Jojo scored.

Water left in the tank = Initial water - Water used
Water left in the tank = 120 - 90
Water left in the tank = 30 liters

Now, Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left in the tank. So, the amount of rainwater collected is 2 * 30 = 60 liters.

"To find the total number of days for the round trip, we need to calculate the days for each leg of the trip.

The bus trip from New Jersey to Rochester takes 6 days. Since it takes half as many days to travel by car, the car trip from Rochester to New Jersey will take 6 / 2 = 3 days.

To find the total number of days for the round trip, we add the days for each leg: 6 (bus trip) + 3 (car trip) = 9 days.

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to first find the total number of water type cards James has after losing 8 and buying 14.

He initially had 40 water type cards, then lost 8, so he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards. Then he bought 14 more, so he now has 32 + 14 = 46 water type cards.

The total number of cards James has is 30 fire type + 20 grass type + 46 water type = 96 cards.

The percentage chance of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, multiplied by 100. 

So, the percentage chance is (46 / 96) * 100 = 47.92%. Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 48%."

The total cost of these extras is $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 = $4.00. 
He also buys 2 sauces for $0.25 each, so that's $0.50. 
The total cost of the extras is $4.00 + $0.50 = $4.50. 
Adding this to the base burrito, the total cost so far is $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00. 
He upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, so the total cost is now $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.

Dolly has 2 books and will read 2 books from Pandora's book, so she will read 2 + 2 = 4 books.

Pandora has 1 book and will read 1 book from Dolly's book, so she will read 1 + 1 = 2 books.

In total, they will read 4 + 2 = 6 books.

"To find out how many letters Mike writes per week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he writes per week. 

He has 3 remaining penpals, and each of them sends 2 letters a week. So, he receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters per week. Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters per week.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages he writes per week. Each letter is 5 pages long, and he writes 6 letters per week. So, he writes 6 * 5 = 30 pages per week.

Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, we need to find out how many minutes he spends writing per week. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 7 = 420 minutes in a week.

Now, we can divide the total number of pages he writes per week (30) by the number of minutes he spends writing per page (6). This gives us 30 / 6 = 5 pages per minute.

Now, we can multiply the number of pages he writes per minute (5) by the number of minutes in a week (420). This gives us 5 * 420 = 2100 minutes per week.

To convert this to hours, we divide the total number of minutes by 60. So, 2100 / 60 = 35 hours per week.

The final answer is: 35"
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to first calculate the total minutes he used for his daily call with his boss. 

He has a 15-minute call with his boss every day, and this month has 30 days. So, the total minutes used for his daily call is 15 * 30 = 450 minutes.

He also had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. 

Now, we need to subtract the total minutes used from his total minutes. 

1000 - 450 - 300 = 250 minutes.

The final answer is 250."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Griffin started with 24 fries. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 fries left.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries left.

Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, but we don't know how many she gave. Let's call the number of fries Ginger gave 'x'. After Ginger gave her fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now, Griffin had 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27.

To solve for x, we subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: x = 27 - 7, x = 20.

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Let's say the number of fish in each aquarium is x. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails. According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, we can set up the equation: 28 = 2x.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 28 / 2 = 14.

So, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

"To find the total amount Jean paid, we need to calculate the total hours worked and then apply the discount.

First, let's calculate the total hours worked:
6 hours per day * 4 days per week = 24 hours per week
24 hours per week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

Now, let's calculate the total amount before the discount:
120 hours * $250 per hour = $30,000

Since the makeup artist gets a 10% discount, we need to calculate the discount amount:
$30,000 * 10% = $3,000

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total amount:
$30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To find out how much each person paid, we need to add up all the costs and divide by 3.

Then, we multiply the total weight by the cost per pound: 
200 pounds * $1.50 = $300

The chef spent $300."
"Let's break down the information given. 

Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday. So, her sister ate a total of 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, so she ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies. On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so she ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies. In total, Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.

Now, let's calculate the calories. 1 cookie has 200 calories, so 46 cookies have 46 * 200 = 9200 calories.

Her sister ate 18 cookies, which is 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

The difference in calories is 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories.

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the number of boys in the third class, we need to know the total number of girls in the school. Since the school is 50% girls, we can calculate the total number of girls as follows:

Total number of girls = 50% of 3 classes
= 0.5 * 3
= 1.5 classes

Since each class has 20 students, the total number of girls in the school is:
1.5 classes * 20 students/class = 30 girls

We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the number of girls in the third class is:
30 girls - 15 girls - 12 girls = 3 girls

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 30. To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of boys:
30 boys - 3 girls = 27 boys

The answer is 27."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many cougars Rick killed today. We know he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, and he killed 15 cougars last night. So, he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.

Now, we know he killed three times as many wolves as cougars today. Since he killed 12 cougars today, he killed 3 x 12 = 36 wolves.

Now, let's add up the total number of animals Rick killed. He killed 10 wolves last night, 15 cougars last night, 12 cougars today, and 36 wolves today. So, the total number of animals he killed is 10 + 15 + 12 + 36 = 73.

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to first find out how many times Anne went down. 

Since Anne went down 30% less than Mitchel, we need to calculate 30% of 30. 
30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 

So, Anne went down 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne, so Robert went down 4 * 21 = 84 times.

The final answer is 84."
"To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we first need to know how many cows Mr. Sylas added to each stall. 

He bought 40 cows and divided them equally among 20 stalls. So, 40 cows / 20 stalls = 2 cows per stall. 

Now, we know that each stall has 2 cows. Since we want to know how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply 2 cows per stall by 8 stalls. 

2 cows per stall * 8 stalls = 16 cows.

"To find out how much money Brady has, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add it to the value of the dollar bills.

A penny is worth 1 cent, so 100 pennies are worth 100 cents.
A nickel is worth 5 cents, so 40 nickels are worth 40 * 5 = 200 cents.
A dime is worth 10 cents, so 20 dimes are worth 20 * 10 = 200 cents.
A dollar bill is worth 100 cents.

Now, let's add up the values:
100 cents (pennies) + 200 cents (nickels) + 200 cents (dimes) = 500 cents.
500 cents is equal to 5 dollars.

Adding the value of the dollar bills: 5 dollars (coins) + 40 dollars (bills) = 45 dollars.

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the weight of the wood that termites ate and subtract it from the total weight of the redwood.

First, we need to find the total weight of the redwood. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we divide the total height by 10 to find the number of sections:

200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections

Now, we multiply the number of sections by the weight per section:

20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds

The termites ate 30% of the wood. To find the weight of the wood that termites ate, we multiply the total weight by 0.3:

8000 pounds * 0.3 = 2400 pounds

Now, we subtract the weight of the wood that termites ate from the total weight:

8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

The redwood weighs 5600 pounds."

"Let's break down the information given:

- Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal. 
- Andrea has 52 apples.
- Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.

Since Andrea has 52 apples, and she has 8 more apples than Jamal, we can find Jamal's apples by subtracting 8 from 52: 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of apples and bananas: 52 (Andrea's apples) + 48 (Jamal's bananas) + 44 (Jamal's apples) = 144.

The total number of fruits is 144."

"To find the total price of the house, we need to add the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee.

Selling price = $350,000
Brokerage fee = 5% of $350,000 = 0.05 x $350,000 = $17,500
Transfer fee = 12% of $350,000 = 0.12 x $350,000 = $42,000

Total price = Selling price + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
Total price = $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000
Total price = $409,500

Since Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000, the difference is:

"To find the time it takes to cook the chicken, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we need to find the time it takes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees. Since it takes 40% longer than 20 minutes, we need to calculate 40% of 20 minutes and add it to 20 minutes.

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 x 20 = 8 minutes. So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees.

Next, we need to find the time it takes to cook the chicken. It takes 5 minutes less than the time it took to heat up the oil, so it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook the chicken.

Now, we need to add the time it took to heat up the oil and the time it took to cook the chicken to find the total time. 28 + 23 = 51 minutes.

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we need to first find out how many stitches the collar and rosette take.

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches the body takes, so it takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes 90 * 2 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes 90 stitches, and the rosette takes 180 stitches. The total number of stitches is 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170.

Since the whole sweater is 1800 stitches, the number of stitches for the sleeves is 1800 - 1170 = 630.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide 630 by 2 to get 315 stitches per sleeve.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into parts.

First, we know the solo song has 54 lines. 

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. Since only a third of the lines in the first scene are Sean's, he has to memorize 1/3 * 108 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of the lines in the second scene are Sean's, so he has to memorize 4/5 * 60 = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be 6x + 9 and Sam's age will be x + 9.

According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So, we can set up the equation:

6x + 9 = 3(x + 9)

Expanding the equation, we get:

6x + 9 = 3x + 27

Subtracting 3x from both sides:

3x + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides:

3x = 18

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 6

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

Now, let's add the value of the quarters and dimes: 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

The can of pop costs 55 cents. To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we subtract the cost of the pop from the total amount of money she has: 145 - 55 = 90 cents.

"To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we need to first find the total number of stars on the flag. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so that's 3 * 8 = 24 stars. 
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so that's 2 * 6 = 12 stars. 
The total number of stars is 24 + 12 = 36 stars. 

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40 stars. 

To find the number of rows, we divide 40 by 5, which is 40 / 5 = 8 rows."
"To find out how many trucks are needed, we need to divide the total weight of the flagstones by the weight the truck can carry. 

First, we need to find the total weight of the flagstones. Since each flagstone weighs 75 pounds and there are 80 flagstones, the total weight is 75 * 80 = 6000 pounds.

Now, we divide the total weight by the weight the truck can carry: 6000 / 2000 = 3.

So, 3 trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. 

Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the car in the slow lane is traveling at 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"So, Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals. Together, they have 22 + 17 = 39 medals. 

If together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out, that means they have 1/10 of the total medals. So, the total number of medals given out is 39 * 10 = 390."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are available, we need to calculate the total number of chocolate bars first. 

There are 4 adults and 8 children. Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24. 

There are 8 packets of chocolate bars, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Now, we subtract the chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars. 40 - 24 = 16 chocolate bars left.

There are 8 children, and the remaining chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them. So, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children. 16 / 8 = 2.

Each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"To find out how much money Susan earns, we need to calculate the total number of minutes she works. 

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is 3 x 60 = 180 minutes. 

However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total minutes. 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to divide 150 by 10 to find out how many 10-minute intervals she worked. 150 / 10 = 15.

Now, we multiply the number of 10-minute intervals by the amount she earns per interval. 15 x $5 = $75.

The final answer is 75."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. Since all three players have more than 20 points, they will each get an extra point.

So, the updated points are:
- Mike: 21 + 1 = 22 points
- Jim: 18 + 1 = 19 points
- Tony: 42 + 1 = 43 points

The total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed is 22 + 19 + 43 = 84 points."
"The youngest son is half as old as the oldest son, so the youngest son is 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

The oldest son will wash 8 oranges and the youngest son will wash 4 oranges. 

In total, they will wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Will buys 15 oranges, so the number of unwashed oranges is 15 - 12 = 3.

"On the first day, Darren does 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses. 

On the second day, he does 20 more pushups than the first day, so he does 100 + 20 = 120 pushups. He does ten fewer squats than the first day, so he does 50 - 10 = 40 squats. He doubles the number of dumbbell presses, so he does 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses.

The total count of the activities he's done in the two days is 100 + 120 + 40 + 40 = 300."
"To find out how many weeks the rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week. 

Since each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 kg.

There are 5 people in the household, so the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 * 5 = 2 kg.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total amount of rice consumed per week is 2 * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, we need to divide the total amount of rice in the bag (42 kg) by the amount consumed per week (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last.

42 / 14 = 3

So, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks.

"Let's calculate the total number of crates Sam sold. 

He sold 20 crates on Saturday and Sunday, 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday. 

20 + 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 85 crates

Since his target was 120 crates, he was short by 120 - 85 = 35 crates."
"To find out how much Carmen paid for the desk, we need to calculate the total amount she bid. 

The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time. Since there were 3 other people who bid once, the bids went up by $50 three times. 

The first bid was $200. 
The second bid was $200 + $50 = $250. 
The third bid was $250 + $50 = $300. 
The fourth bid was $300 + $50 = $350. 

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she bids $350, $400, and $450. 

The final bid was $450. 

To find the total amount Carmen paid, we add the bids she made: $200 + $350 + $400 + $450 = $1300. 

The desk cost Carmen $1300."
"To find out how much John pays a year for driving, we need to calculate the total miles driven and the total cost of the miles driven, plus the bonus.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven per year. John drives to work and back, so the total miles driven per day is 30 * 2 = 60 miles. He does this 5 days a week, so the total miles driven per week is 60 * 5 = 300 miles. Since he does this for 50 weeks a year, the total miles driven per year is 300 * 50 = 15,000 miles.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the miles driven. John is charged $2 per mile driven, so the total cost of the miles driven per year is 15,000 * 2 = $30,000.

John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus per year is 150 * 12 = $1,800.

Now, let's add the cost of the miles driven and the bonus to find the total cost per year. The total cost per year is 30,000 + 1,800 = $31,800.

The final answer is: 31800"
"To find out how much Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we need to first find out how much he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined. 

He exercised 23 minutes on Sunday and 16 minutes on Monday. 
23 + 16 = 39 minutes

Since he wants to exercise twice that amount on Tuesday, we multiply 39 by 2. 
39 * 2 = 78 minutes

So, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."

"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to subtract the money she spent from the total amount she had.

Annika started with $50. She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25. Then, she spent an additional $10 on rides. 

So, the total money she spent is $25 + $10 = $35. 

Now, we subtract the money she spent from the total amount she had: $50 - $35 = $15.

Annika has $15 left.

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to first find out how many books she sold in the second year. 

We know that she sold 45 books this year, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. So, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

Now, we know that she has 250 books in total and 50 unsold books. So, the total number of books she sold in the first two years is 250 - 50 = 200 books.

We already know that she sold 90 books in the first year, so the number of books she sold in the second year is 200 - 90 = 110 books.

Since each book sells at 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 110 * 20 = 2200$."
"Watson works 5 days a week, and there are 4 weeks in April. So, he works 5 * 4 = 20 days in April. 

He earns $10 per hour and works 10 hours a day, so he earns 10 * 10 = $100 per day. For 20 days, he earns 20 * 100 = $2000. 

He also gets a $300 bonus for the whole month. So, his total earnings for April are 2000 + 300 = $2300."
"To find out how many people John lost to, we need to calculate 20 * 0.2 (since 80% is the same as 0.8). 

20 * 0.8 = 16

"To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning: 
   Two-thirds of 60 loaves is (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves.

2. Calculate the number of loaves left after the morning sales: 
   60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

3. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening: 
   Half of the remaining loaves is (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves.

So, 10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon."
"To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we need to know how much weight Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can divide 8 by 4 to find out how much he loses in one week. 

8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

4 weeks"
"To find out how much you'll save, first, calculate the cost of 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk.

2 tubs of ice cream cost 2 x $13 = $26.
4 packets of milk cost 4 x $0.5 = $2.

The total cost is $26 + $2 = $28.

The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk would be 2 x $13 + 4 x $0.5 = $26 + $2 = $28.

Since you're buying the same items, the total cost remains the same. Therefore, you won't save any money.

"To figure this out, we need to calculate how many times the person will get extra arms and legs in 15 days. 

For extra arms, the person gets one every 3 days. So, in 15 days, they will get 15 / 3 = 5 extra arms.

For extra legs, the person gets one every 5 days. So, in 15 days, they will get 15 / 5 = 3 extra legs.

In total, the person will have 5 extra arms and 3 extra legs. 

5 + 3 = 8

"To find out how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to calculate how much he has available for the trip after buying the suits, suitcases, and flight ticket.

First, let's calculate the cost of the suits: 6 suits * $100 each = $600.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases * $50 each = $150.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. So, the cost of the flight ticket is 5 * $100 + $700 = $700 + $500 = $1200.

Now, let's add up the costs of the suits, suitcases, and flight ticket: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

Theo has $6000 initially and wants to save $2000, so he has $6000 - $2000 = $4000 available for the trip.

Now, let's subtract the available amount from the total cost of the trip: $1950 - $4000 = -$2050. Since we can't spend a negative amount, this means Theo doesn't have enough money for the trip.

However, since we are asked about the amount he has to spend on gifts, we can assume he will have to cut back on other expenses or find a way to make up for the shortage. 

The final answer is: $2050"
"To find out how many eggs the family consumes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs eaten by each group per day and then multiply it by 7.

Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 eggs per day. 
The rest of the family, which is 2 people, eat 2 eggs each day, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 eggs per day.

Now, let's add the total number of eggs eaten by both groups per day: 9 + 4 = 13 eggs per day.

To find out how many eggs the family consumes in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7: 13 x 7 = 91 eggs.

"To find Trent's age, we need to work backwards from Quinn's age. 

Quinn is 30 years old. 
Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so Jane is 30 - 3 = 27 years old. 
Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so Trent is 27 + 5 = 32 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. Since Cera is currently 46 years old, six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old. 

So, six years ago, Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. So, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, the current population of Chile is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

The final answer is: 120,000"
"To find the number of players on the defense, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of players on the defense is x.

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it's x/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. The sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams should equal 105.

So, we can write the equation: x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms: 7x = 210

Divide both sides by 7: x = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

"To find out how many people show up for Martha's party, we need to calculate the total number of people invited and subtract the ones who couldn't come.

First, let's calculate the total number of people invited:
- 2 families with 6 people = 2 x 6 = 12
- 3 families with 4 people = 3 x 4 = 12
Total people invited = 12 + 12 = 24

Now, let's calculate the number of people who couldn't come:
- 8 people couldn't come due to illness
- 1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments = 8 / 4 = 2
Total people who couldn't come = 8 + 2 = 10

Now, let's subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:
24 - 10 = 14

So, 14 people show up for Martha's party."
"To find the total weight of marbles, we need to first find the total number of marbles Solomon has. 

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna. His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 2/5 of 20 is 8. So, his father gave him 8 marbles. 

Now, Solomon has 20 + 8 = 28 marbles. The store already had 50 marbles. So, the total number of marbles is 28 + 50 = 78.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, the total weight of marbles is 78 * 2 = 156 kgs.

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool first. 

The volume of a rectangular pool is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and depth. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 5
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Since it costs $.1 per cubic foot to fill the pool, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot.

Cost = Volume * cost per cubic foot
Cost = 120 * .1
Cost = 12

The cost to fill the pool is $12."
"To find the total number of children, we need to first find the number of girls and nongendered children.

Since there are 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.

Since there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, the number of nongendered children is 1/10 * 30 = 3.

"To find the number of electric poles, we need to first find the number of electric poles. 

The ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, so for every 3 electric wires, there is 1 electric pole. 

We know that the total number of electric wires is 45. To find the number of sets of 3 electric wires, we divide 45 by 3. 

45 ÷ 3 = 15

Since there is 1 electric pole for every 3 electric wires, there are 15 electric poles."
"To find out how many people left, we need to calculate the total number of people at the beginning of the party. 

There were 25 men and 15 women, so the total number of people is 25 + 15 = 40.

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we need to find 1/4 of 40. 

1/4 of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10.

So, 10 people left the party. 

We know that 22 men stayed at the party. Since there were originally 25 men, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3.

Now, we know that 3 men and 10 people in total left the party. We already know that 3 men left, so the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7.

To find out how many women are left, we subtract the number of women who left from the original number of women. 

15 - 7 = 8.

There are 8 women left at the party.

The final answer is 1."
"To find out how many pencils Jam and Meg have in total, we need to add the pencils Jam has to the pencils Meg has. 

Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, so let's first find out how many pencils are in the boxes. Since we don't know how many pencils are in each box, let's call the number of pencils in each box 'x'. 

So, Jam has 3x + 2 pencils. 

Meg has 46 pencils. 

Now, we add the pencils Jam and Meg have: 
3x + 2 + 46 = total pencils

Since we know the total number of pencils is 26, we can set up the equation: 
3x + 2 + 46 = 26

Now, let's solve for x: 
3x + 48 = 26 
3x = -22 
x = -22/3 

Since we can't have a fraction of a pencil, this doesn't make sense. Let's recheck the problem. 

The problem says Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, and the total number of pencils is 26. This means Jam has 3x + 2 = 26. 

Now, let's solve for x: 
3x + 2 = 26 
3x = 24 
x = 8 

So, each box has 8 pencils. Now, we know how many pencils Jam has: 
3x + 2 = 3(8) + 2 = 26 

Now, let's add the pencils Jam and Meg have: 
26 + 46 = 72 

Since Jam has 26 pencils, and each box has 8 pencils, we can divide 26 by 8 to find out how many boxes Jam has: 
26 ÷ 8 = 3.25 

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, Jam has 3 boxes. 

Now, we need to find out how many boxes Meg has. Meg has 46 pencils, and each box has 8 pencils. 
46 ÷ 8 = 5.75 

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, Meg has 5 boxes. 

In total, Jam and Meg have 3 + 5 = 8 boxes."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cooling effect of the ice cubes and the added cream. 

First, let's calculate the cooling effect of the ice cubes. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, we can divide 65 by 13 to find the number of ice cubes used. 

65 / 13 = 5

So, 5 ice cubes are used. Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so the total weakening effect of the ice cubes is 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters.

Next, we need to add the weakening effect of the added cream. The added cream makes the coffee 15 milliliters weaker.

Now, we add the weakening effects of the ice cubes and the cream: 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many new records the 5 people got and then divide that by 2 to find out how many old records they brought in.

Since each person gets 7 new records, and there are 5 people, the total number of new records is 5 x 7 = 35.

Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, we divide the total number of new records by 2 to find the total number of old records. 

35 / 2 = 17.5

Since you can't trade half a record, we round down to 17.5 to 17 old records."
"To find the number of junior programmers, we need to calculate 2/5 of 100. 
2/5 * 100 = 40

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, we need to find the salary of a senior programmer. 
$2000 + $400 = $2400

Now, we need to find the number of senior programmers. 
Since there are 40 junior programmers, and the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60.

The total amount of money the company pays to junior programmers per month is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to senior programmers per month is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000."

"To find out how long it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge. 

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge.

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it will take to charge 40% as follows:

40% / 1% = 40
40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we can convert 120 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

"To find the net pay for Job A, we need to calculate the total pay first. 

Total pay for Job A = $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000

Since the state has a 20% total tax rate, we need to calculate the tax amount.

Tax amount for Job A = $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000

Net pay for Job A = Total pay - Tax amount
Net pay for Job A = $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

For Job B, we are given the total pay, but we need to calculate the net pay first. 

First, we need to calculate the net income after property tax. 

Net income after property tax = Total pay - Property tax
Net income after property tax = $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000

Next, we need to calculate the tax amount on the net income after property tax.

Tax amount for Job B = Net income after property tax * 0.10
Tax amount for Job B = $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600

Net pay for Job B = Net income after property tax - Tax amount
Net pay for Job B = $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we can compare the net pay for both jobs.

Net pay for Job A = $24,000
Net pay for Job B = $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: 8400"
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we need to calculate half of the number of ruined castles. 

First, we find the number of ruined castles: 
40% of 220 castles = 0.4 * 220 = 88 castles.

Then, we find half of the ruined castles: 
Half of 88 castles = 88 / 2 = 44 castles.

So, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

"To find the total cost of each offer, we need to calculate the total amount paid in installments and add the advance payment.

Furniture United's offer: 
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

Cozy Homes' offer: 
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

The cost difference between the two offers is $3,450 - $3,350 = $100."
"To find out how many guns they would have if they shared them equally, we need to add up all the guns they have and divide by 4.

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns. 
8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24

Now, we divide 24 by 4. 
24 / 4 = 6

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the value of each share after the price changes.

Initially, Maria buys 8 shares for $8 each, so the total cost is 8 * 8 = $64.

In the first year, the stock price increases by 50%, so the new price is 8 + (8 * 0.5) = 12 dollars per share.

The total value of Maria's shares after the first year is 8 * 12 = $96.

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%, so the new price is 12 - (12 * 0.25) = 9 dollars per share.

The total value of Maria's shares after the second year is 8 * 9 = $72.

The final value of all Maria's shares is $72."
"To find out how many hot dogs John ate, we need to first find out how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, Thomas ate 3 * 2 = 6 hot dogs.

Then, John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate. 3 - 2 = 1.

"To find the number of students in the smallest group, let's denote the number of students in the two equal-sized groups as x. 

Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students is 200, and there are 3 groups. So, the sum of the students in all three groups is 200. 

We can write the equation as: 
x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms: 
3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides: 
3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3: 
x = 70

Now that we know x, we can find the number of students in the smallest group: 
x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60

The answer is 60."
"To find the total number of legs, we need to know the number of chickens and cows. 

Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, let's say the number of cows is x. Then, the number of chickens is 2x. 

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so x + 2x = 60. 

3x = 60 
x = 20 

So, there are 20 cows and 2x = 40 chickens. 

Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. 

Total legs = (20 * 4) + (40 * 2) 
Total legs = 80 + 80 
Total legs = 160 

The final answer is: 160"
"Josh started with 3 balls and added 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. So, he had 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7 balls.

7 - 1 = 6 balls."
"To find the weight of the blue beetle, I know the pink frog weighs the same as it, so the blue beetle weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, I need to add the weights of the pink frog, blue beetle, yellow snake, and red bird, and also add the weight of the container. 

50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 60 (yellow snake) + 30 (red bird) = 190 pounds

Adding the weight of the container: 190 + 20 = 210 pounds.

The total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is 210 pounds."
"To find the total number of outfits, we need to add the outfits Laurel received from her friend, the baby shower, and her mom.

Laurel received 24 outfits from her friend.
She received twice that amount at the baby shower, so she got 2 * 24 = 48 outfits.

"To find out how much Davos paid for the 2 shirts, we need to calculate the discount first. 

The original price of 2 shirts is 2 x $30 = $60. 

The discount is 40% of $60, which is 0.4 x $60 = $24. 

So, the discount amount is $24. 

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price: $60 - $24 = $36. 

Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.

"To find the difference in daily earnings, we need to calculate the earnings from tractors and silos separately.

Earnings from tractors: 10 tractors * $100 per tractor = $1000 per day
Earnings from silos: 5 silos * $220 per silo = $1100 per day

The difference in daily earnings is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we need to divide the difference by the original earnings and multiply by 100.

Percentage increase = (100 / 1000) * 100 = 10%

So, they are making 10% more per day now.

"To find out how much Madeline spends on her dog per month, we need to add the cost of food, treats, and medicine. 

First, we need to find the weekly cost of food. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly cost of food is 4 * $25 = $100. 

Now, we add the monthly cost of treats ($20) and medicine ($100) to the monthly cost of food ($100). 
$100 + $20 + $100 = $220

So, Madeline spends $220 per month on her dog.

"To find out how much time John spent sightseeing, we need to first calculate the total time he spent on other activities.

He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, so he spent 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming.

He watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so he spent 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows.

The total time spent on these activities is 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

Since this is 30% of his total time, we can set up the equation:

15 = 0.3x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.3:

x = 15 / 0.3
x = 50

So, John spent 50 hours on vacation.

The time he spent sightseeing is 40% of his total time, so we can calculate it as follows:

Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * 50
Time spent sightseeing = 20

From her first job, she earns $10 per hour for 20 hours, so she earns 10 * 20 = $200.

From her second job, she earns $5 per hour for 15 hours, so she earns 5 * 15 = $75.

Adding her earnings from both jobs, she earns 200 + 75 = $275.

Now, we add her initial savings to her earnings: 80 + 275 = $355.

"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate how much money she has left after buying the mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-kart rides.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the mini-golf and go-kart rides. 

- 1 round of mini-golf costs $5.
- 2 go-kart rides cost 2 x $10 = $20.

Total cost for mini-golf and go-kart rides = $5 + $20 = $25.

Now, let's subtract this from her budget of $90.

$90 - $25 = $65

Since each friend will get $5 in arcade tokens, we need to subtract this from the remaining budget.

$65 - $5 = $60

Now, we can divide the remaining budget by the cost of arcade tokens per friend to find out how many friends Morgan can invite.

$60 ÷ $5 = 12

So, Morgan can invite 12 friends to her party."

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to add the distances between the cities. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles. 
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. 
The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the other two, so it is 100 + 75 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance of one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance by the service interval: 18,000 / 900 = 20.

Distance back home = 240 miles

Total distance = 210 + 240 = 450 miles

Now, let's calculate the time taken for each part of the trip.

Time taken to reach friend's house = Distance / Speed
Time taken to reach friend's house = 200 / 70 = 2.86 hours

Time taken for detour = Distance / Speed
Time taken for detour = 10 / 70 = 0.14 hours

Time taken to return home = Distance / Speed
Time taken to return home = 240 / 80 = 3 hours

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks is 3. 

Since a number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting, we can calculate the number of shoplifters as follows:
4 * 3 - 5 = 7

Now, three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, so the number of people kicked out for physical violence is 3 * 7 = 21.

We know that a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart. We can set up an equation to represent this:
3 (refusing to wear masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) + x (other reasons) = 50

Combine the known values:
3 + 7 + 21 = 31
31 + x = 50

Subtract 31 from both sides:
x = 50 - 31
x = 19

So, 19 people were kicked out for other reasons.

Let's say Sara had x points before. Then, Erin had 3x points before. We know that Erin scored 14 points, so 3x = 14. 

To find x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 14 / 3. 

x = 4.67

So, Sara had 4.67 points before. 

Now, we need to find out how many points Erin had before. Since Erin had 3x points before, Erin had 3 * 4.67 = 14 points before."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break it down into parts.

There are 44 seniors, and each needs a frame, so the total cost for the frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

Next, 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each, so the total cost for the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Now, 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 officers. Each officer needs a cord that costs $12, so the total cost for the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

The total amount spent is $400,000, and 40% of the equipment is faulty. 

First, we need to find 40% of $400,000. 
40% of $400,000 = 0.4 * $400,000 = $160,000

So, the number of faulty pieces of equipment is $160,000 / $1,000 = 160 pieces.

Now, we subtract the number of faulty pieces from the total number of pieces to find the number of functioning pieces.
Total number of pieces = $400,000 / $1,000 = 400 pieces
Number of functioning pieces = Total number of pieces - Number of faulty pieces
= 400 - 160
= 240 pieces

Now, we multiply the number of functioning pieces by the cost of each piece to find the total amount spent on functioning pieces.
Cost of each piece = $1,000
Total amount spent on functioning pieces = Number of functioning pieces * Cost of each piece
= 240 * $1,000

She washed 10 pairs of socks. Since each pair has 2 socks, she washed 10 * 2 = 20 socks. 

She also washed 15 loose socks. 

So, the total number of socks she has washed is 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

There are 50 socks in total. To find out how many socks she has missed, we subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks. 

50 - 35 = 15

She has missed 15 socks."
"To find out how many cookies are left, we need to add the cookies Rachel bought and the cookies Janet gave her, then subtract the cookies her brother ate.

First, let's add the cookies: 
23 (Rachel's cookies) + 42 (Janet's cookies) = 65 cookies

Then, let's subtract the cookies her brother ate: 
65 (total cookies) - 44 (cookies eaten) = 21 cookies

So, there are 21 cookies left for Rachel."
"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total interest she needs to pay over the 5 months. 

First, we need to find the total interest she needs to pay. The formula for simple interest is: 

Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

In this case, Principal = $3,650, Rate = 10% or 0.10, and Time = 5 months.

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Interest = $1,825

Since Karan has to pay the interest and the principal over 5 months, we need to divide the total interest by 5 to find out the monthly payment.

Monthly payment = Total interest / Number of months
Monthly payment = $1,825 / 5
Monthly payment = $365

So, Karan has to pay $365 per month.

"To find out how far Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time. Cho hiked 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours, so Cho hiked 14 * 8 = 112 kilometers.

Chloe hiked 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours, so Chloe hiked 9 * 5 = 45 kilometers.

To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we need to subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked. 112 - 45 = 67 kilometers.

"To find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make, we multiply the number of pitchers by the number of cups per pitcher. 

3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups

Since she sells each cup for $1, the total amount of money she makes from selling lemonade is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

She spends $18 on supplies, so her profit is $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells 4 cups per hour, the number of hours she needs to sell all the lemonade is 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

Her profit per hour is $18 / 9 hours = $2.

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we need to set up an equation. Let's say he had x hectares of land initially. 

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he sold 3/5 * x hectares. The amount he has left is 2/5 of his initial land, which is 12.8 hectares. 

So, 2/5 * x = 12.8

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * 5/2
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"To find the number of girls in the choir, we need to calculate 50% of 52, which is 26. Since the choir is performing with just the female members, there are 26 girls.

Now, half of the people performing can't make it to the show. This means 50% of the 26 girls can't make it, which is 13. So, 26 - 13 = 13 girls are performing.

The choir's 3 teachers also decide to sing with them. So, the total number of people performing is 13 girls + 3 teachers = 16.

The final answer is 16."
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to add up all the test scores and divide by the number of tests.

First, let's add up the scores: 
65 + 94 = 159
159 + 81 = 240
240 + 86 = 326
326 + 74 = 400

The total cost is $36."
"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to add the messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu. 

First, we need to find out how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as to Ms. Thompson, we multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

1/3 * 66 = 22

Now, we add the messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu.

66 + 22 = 88

So, James delivers a total of 88 messages."
"To find out how much money David saves, we need to calculate the cost of buying 9 rides with tickets and compare it to the cost of buying a ride bracelet.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 9 rides with tickets. Each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, so 9 rides will cost 9 * 2 * 2 = 36 tickets. Since each ticket costs $2, the total cost is 36 * 2 = $72.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying a ride bracelet. The bracelet costs $30.

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract the cost of the ride bracelet from the cost of buying 9 rides with tickets. So, David saves 72 - 30 = $42.

"To find out how many popsicles each person has, we need to divide the total number of popsicles by the sum of the parts in the ratio (5 + 6 = 11). 

165 / 11 = 15

So, Betty has 15 * 5 = 75 popsicles and Sam has 15 * 6 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has.

90 - 75 = 15

The answer is 15."
"To find out how much Tim saves, we need to calculate the cost of the streaming services and compare it to the cost of the cable package.

First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services. Netflix costs $10 a month. Hulu and Disney Plus cost $10 each, but since Tim gets a 20% discount for bundling, the cost of each of them will be 80% of $10, which is $8. 

So, the total cost of the streaming services will be $10 (Netflix) + $8 (Hulu) + $8 (Disney Plus) = $26.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the cable package, which is $60. 

To find out how much Tim saves, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package: $60 - $26 = $34.

So, Tim saves $34 by cancelling his cable subscription."
"To find the total work time, we need to add the time spent writing, recording, and editing. 

First, we need to convert the time spent recording into hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 90 minutes is 90/60 = 1.5 hours.

Now, we can add the time spent on each task: 
4 hours (writing) + 1.5 hours (recording) + 1.5 hours (editing) = 7 hours

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we divide the time spent editing by the total time and multiply by 100:
(1.5 hours / 7 hours) * 100 = 21.43%

The answer is 21.43."
"To find the total number of books Wendy needs, we first need to find the total number of books that can fit in the shelving system. 

Since the shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, the total number of books it can hold is 6 * 6 = 36.

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in the system. Double the number of books is 2 * 36 = 72. 

So, Wendy needs to place 72 + 20 = 92 books in the shelving system.

The final answer is: 92"
"To find out how many Valentine's cards Erica has, we need to add the cards she made, the cards her dad brought, and the cards she received.

She made 20 cards.
Her dad brought 2 boxes of 15 cards each, so 2 x 15 = 30 cards.
She received 17 cards from family and friends.

Now, let's add all the cards together: 20 (made) + 30 (from dad) + 17 (received) = 67 cards.

So, Erica now has 67 Valentine's Day cards.

"To find out how many slices are left, we need to first calculate how many slices Jenny gave away. 

Jenny gave 1/3 of 12 slices to Bill, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 slices. 
Then, she gave 1/4 of 12 slices to Mark, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 slices.

So, Jenny gave away 4 + 3 = 7 slices in total.

Jenny started with 12 slices and gave away 7, so she has 12 - 7 = 5 slices left.

Jenny also ate 2 slices, so now she has 5 - 2 = 3 slices left.

The answer is 3."
"To find out how many days Mark needs to save, we need to subtract the cost of the bike from the amount of money he has. 

$50 (initial amount) - $300 (bike cost) = -$250 (shortage)

Since Mark can't save a negative amount, he doesn't have enough money to buy the bike. He needs more money to buy the bike.

The answer is: He can't buy the bike."
"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs first.

She saw 90 spiders. 
She saw 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders, so she saw 1/3 * 90 = 30 millipedes.

She saw a number of stink bugs equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. 
So, she saw 2 * 30 - 12 = 48 stink bugs.

Now, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs to find the total number of bugs. 
90 + 30 + 48 = 168

The total number of bugs is 168."
"To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we need to first find the ages of Alice and Beth. 

Since Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years younger than Erica, Beth is 30 - 5 = 25 years old.

Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice is 25 + 7 = 32 years old.

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 32 - 30 = 2 years.

"To find out how many bags of flour Mark needs, we need to multiply the normal recipe by 4 since he's making a quadruple batch. 

For flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, we divide 12 by 2 to get the number of bags: 12 / 2 = 6 bags

For milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups
Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we divide 4 by 2 to get the number of bottles: 4 / 2 = 2 bottles

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles from the number of bags: 6 - 2 = 4

"To find out how much energy Mel saves, we need to first find out how much energy he uses in a day. 

He uses 900 watts for 8 hours a day. There are 1000 watts in 1 kilowatt. So, 900 watts is 0.9 kilowatts. 

0.9 kilowatts * 8 hours = 7.2 kilowatt-hours per day.

If he reduces the time by 5 hours, he will use 0.9 kilowatts * 3 hours = 2.7 kilowatt-hours per day.

The difference is 7.2 - 2.7 = 4.5 kilowatt-hours per day.

In 30 days, he will save 4.5 * 30 = 135 kilowatt-hours.

"To find the average number of stripes, we need to add up all the stripes and divide by the number of zebras. 

First, let's add up the stripes: 
2 zebras with 17 stripes each = 2 x 17 = 34 stripes
1 zebra with 36 stripes = 36 stripes
1 zebra with half of 36 stripes = 36 / 2 = 18 stripes
Total stripes = 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes

Now, let's divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras: 
88 stripes / 3 zebras = 29.33 stripes per zebra

The average number of stripes per zebra is 29.33."
"To determine the total cost, we need to calculate how many pounds of meat and cheese are needed. 

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and each sandwich serves 4 people, we need 20 / 4 = 5 sandwiches. 

So, we need 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese. 

The cost of the meat is 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00. 

The cost of the cheese is 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00. 

The total cost is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00."
"To find the number of corns, we know that Allan bought 40 fewer corns than cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, he bought 40 - 40 = 0 corns. 

Now, we know Allan has 40 cannolis and 0 corns initially. He bought 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns. So, he now has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis and 0 + 40 = 40 corns.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 + 40 = 140."
"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to subtract the steps he already took from the total steps he wants to take. 

Elliott wants to take 10,000 steps. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. He also did 1,000 steps with his friend. So, he took 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps so far. 

Now, he has 10,000 - 6,000 = 4,000 steps left. He only has 2,000 steps left after his jog. So, the steps he took during his jog is 4,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 steps.

"To find out how many minutes it will take Toby to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of words in the book by his reading rate.

The book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page, so the total number of words is 45 * 200 = 9000 words.

Toby can read 300 words per minute, so it will take him 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes to finish the book.

Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 10 minutes to get there, so he will arrive at the airport 60 - 10 = 50 minutes after he finishes the book.

"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the intersection of the two events. 

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the candles have this defect, we multiply 50000 by 0.05.

50000 * 0.05 = 2500

Now, we need to find the probability that a candle both smells like wet dog and explodes. Since the problem doesn't provide any information about the probability of a candle exploding, we can assume that the probability of a candle exploding is independent of its smell. Therefore, the probability of a candle both smelling like wet dog and exploding is the product of the individual probabilities.

However, since the problem doesn't provide the probability of a candle exploding, we can't calculate the exact number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. We can only calculate the number of candles that smell like wet dog.

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees, but the exact amount is unknown.
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so she gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
- Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so she gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.
- The sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by the sisters from the tallest and shortest trees is 60 + 45 = 105 apples.

Since the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - 105 = 395 apples.

First, we know that the total savings from both jeans is $6. We also know that Cole saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans. Let's call the original price of the jogger jeans 'x'. 

Since Cole saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans, he saved (1/3)x dollars from the jogger jeans. The rest of the savings, which is 2/3x, must have come from the tattered jeans. We know that the tattered jeans cost $28, so 2/3x = 28. 

To find x, we multiply both sides by 3/2, which gives us x = 28 * (3/2) = 42. 

Now that we know the original price of the jogger jeans is $42, we can find the difference between the original price of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans. The difference is 42 - 28 = 14.

The total number of birds from the homemade feeders is 6 * 30 = 180 birds.

So, the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is 120 + 180 = 300 birds.

300"
"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item. 

The bagel costs $4. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. 25% of $4 is $1. So, the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5.

The cake costs half of the price of the bagel. Half of $4 is $2.

Now, let's add up the costs: $4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to first figure out how much money he made from selling the cards. 

He spent $50 on the amusement park ticket and had $50 in spending cash, so he must have made $100 in total from selling the cards. 

Since he sells each card for $1.5, we can divide the total amount of money he made ($100) by the price of each card ($1.5) to find out how many cards he sold.

$100 / $1.5 = 66.67

Since we can't sell a fraction of a card, we'll round down to 66 cards.

Now, we know Kenny sold 66 cards. Since he kept 1/3 of his cards, we can set up an equation to find out how many cards he started with:

Let's say he started with x cards.

He sold 66 cards, so he kept 1/3 of x, which is x/3 cards.

We know that the number of cards he kept is equal to the number of cards he started with minus the number of cards he sold:

x/3 = x - 66

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3:

x = 3x - 198

Now, we can subtract 3x from both sides:

-2x = -198

Dividing both sides by -2:

x = 99

So, Kenny started with 99 cards.

The final answer is: 99"
"To find out how many hotdogs the caterer prepared, we need to calculate half of 36, which is 18. Since the caterer prepared 18 hotdogs, but 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog, the caterer had 40 hotdogs. 

Since 40 guests wanted a second hotdog, and there were 40 hotdogs, all the guests got a second hotdog. 

The answer is: 0"
"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we need to first find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Indras has 6 letters, so half of that is 6 / 2 = 3. 

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than that, so it's 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Now, we need to add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name. 
6 (Indras) + 7 (sister) = 13

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items first. 

The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00. 
The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00. 
The cost of the utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost of the items is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Now, we need to calculate the discount. The discount is 20% of the total cost. 
20% of $165.00 is 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

The total cost after the discount is $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

The final answer is 132."
"To find out how much money Dora needs, we need to add up the cost of the items she wants to buy. 

The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. 

$6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Dora has $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother, so she has $2 + $16 = $18.

To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost of the items. 

$19 - $18 = $1

The final answer is 1."
"To find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to follow the information step by step.

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons. 
Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, so Prince Arthur slew 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.
Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so Prince Walter slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.
Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so Prince Bruce slew 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

"To find out how many gallons Josey needed, we need to calculate 1/4 of 15 gallons. 

1 gallon is equal to 8 pints. So, 1/4 of 15 gallons is 15 * 1/4 = 15/4 = 3.75 gallons.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints, we multiply 3.75 gallons by 8 pints per gallon. 

3.75 * 8 = 30 pints.

Josey needed 30 pints of gasoline."
"To find out how many candy bars George bought, we need to first find out how much money he spent on chips. 

He bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each. So, he spent 3 x 40 cents = 120 cents on chips. 

Since he spent $5 in total, he had 5 - 1 = 4 dollars left. 

Now, we need to convert the remaining money to cents. 4 dollars is equal to 400 cents. 

Now, we subtract the money spent on chips from the remaining money. 400 cents - 120 cents = 280 cents. 

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we divide 280 cents by 75 cents to find out how many candy bars George bought. 280 / 75 = 3.73. 

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to 3 candy bars."
"To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we need to subtract the number of lollipops Ray kept from the total number of lollipops he had. 

25 (total lollipops) - 5 (lollipops Ray kept) = 20

Now, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends. 

20 (remaining lollipops) ÷ 4 (number of friends) = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

5"
"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the two pieces that Rory and her mom ate from the total weight of the cake.

Rory and her mom each have a piece, so they ate 2 pieces in total. 

The cake weighs 20 ounces. 

20 - 2 = 18

The remaining cake weighs 18 ounces."
"To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we need to add the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have, which is 34 + 22 = 56.

Then, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people, including Sitti and Juris. There are 6 friends plus Sitti and Juris, so that's 6 + 2 = 8 people.

Now, we divide 56 oranges by 8 people: 56 ÷ 8 = 7.

So, everyone will get 7 oranges."
"To find the total cost of the onions, we need to multiply the weight of the onions by the price per pound. Antoine needs 2 pounds of onions, and they are on sale for $2.00 a pound. 

2 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $4.00

Antoine likes to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 pounds = 4 pounds of onions. 

4 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $8.00

Antoine also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which are on sale for $2.00 a box. 

2 boxes * $2.00 per box = $4.00

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 for the onions and $4.00 for the beef stock. 

$8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00

Antoine's soup serves 6 people, so we need to divide the total cost by the number of servings to find the cost per serving. 

$12.00 / 6 servings = $2.00 per serving

The cost per serving is $2.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Bernadette to get to the theater. Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, it will take Bernadette 4 * 4 = 16 minutes to get to the theater.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, she should leave 16 - 5 = 11 minutes earlier than Wayne.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so 3 yards is equal to 3 x 3 = 9 feet.

Now, we know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet. To find the width, we can divide the area by the length: 360 / 9 = 40 feet.

The perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of all its sides. Since the room is rectangular, we have two lengths and two widths. So, the perimeter is 2 x (length + width) = 2 x (9 + 40) = 2 x 49 = 98 feet.

"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads each one bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. 
1 pack of red beads = 1 * 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 * 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.
3 packs of blue beads = 3 * 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 * 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the total beads of the sister with fewer beads from the sister with more beads.
Elizabeth has 60 beads, and Margareth has 140 beads.
140 - 60 = 80

The answer is 80."
"First, let's calculate the temperature increase from baking. Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, the total temperature increase is 3 * 5 = 15 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the temperature decrease from opening the window. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, the temperature decrease is 30 / 10 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Now, we need to add the temperature increase and subtract the temperature decrease. The initial temperature is 40 degrees. So, the final temperature is 40 + 15 - 6 = 49 degrees.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took James to complete the swim. 

Jon's swim time is 40 minutes. James finishes the swim 10% faster, so we need to calculate 10% of 40 minutes. 

10% of 40 minutes is 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes. 

So, James finishes the swim 4 minutes faster than Jon. 

Jon's swim time is 40 minutes, so James' swim time is 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

Now, we know that Jon's total time is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes. 

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time must be 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

We already know James' swim time is 36 minutes. We also know that James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. 

Jon's bike time is 80 minutes, so James' bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, we can calculate James' run time. 

James' total time is 180 minutes, and his swim and bike times are 36 + 85 = 121 minutes. 

So, James' run time is 180 - 121 = 59 minutes.

"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie C in minutes. 

Since Movie C was 1.25 hours, we convert it to minutes by multiplying by 60. 
1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes

Now, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. 
So, Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes long.

Since Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, we divide the length of Movie B by 4. 
80 / 4 = 20 minutes

The final answer is 20."
"To find out how much hay the horse eats, we need to know how far the horse runs. Since the horse runs at 32 miles per hour, and it runs for 30 minutes, we need to convert the time to hours. 

30 minutes is 0.5 hours. 

Distance = speed * time
Distance = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hour
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs, and a bail of hay costs $3, the total cost of hay is:

Cost = 16 miles * 0.5 bails/mile * $3/bail
Cost = 16 * 0.5 * 3
Cost = 24 dollars

Michael has six 5 dollar bills, so he has a total of:
6 * 5 = 30 dollars

Change = Total money - Cost of hay
Change = 30 - 24
Change = 6 dollars"
"To find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total, we need to add the eggs from the cases and the loose eggs. 

4 dozen eggs is equal to 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. 
Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Since each glass needs 5 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 5 to find out how many glasses she can fill. 
50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays Rozanne can put out. 
10 / 5 = 2 trays.

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the sneakers and the total amount of money he made from selling them.

The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576. 

He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each, so he made 17 x $20 = $340 from those sales.

The remaining sneakers are 48 - 17 = 31.

He sold the remaining 31 sneakers for $25 each, so he made 31 x $25 = $775 from those sales.

The total amount of money he made is $340 + $775 = $1115.

The salesman's profit is the total amount of money he made minus the total cost of the sneakers, which is $1115 - $576 = $539.

"To find the regular price of popcorn, let's break down the information given. 

You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket. The super ticket costs $20, and the extra $1 for popcorn and soda is $1. So, the total cost of the super ticket and the extra $1 is $21.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the cost of the movie ticket and the popcorn and soda without the super ticket is $21 - $2 = $19.

You know the cost of the soda is $3. So, the cost of the movie ticket and the popcorn without the super ticket is $19 - $3 = $16.

Now, you can buy a movie ticket for $12. So, the cost of the popcorn without the super ticket is $16 - $12 = $4.

The final answer is 4."
"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to first find the cost of filling one balloon after the price increase. 

The cost of filling 20 balloons before the price increase was $900. So, the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase was $900 / 20 = $45.

The cost of filling one balloon after the price increase is $45 + $20 = $65.

Now, we can find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase by multiplying the cost of filling one balloon by 170. 

$65 * 170 = $11,100.

The final answer is 11,100."
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

The car drives 60 mph for 2 hours, so the distance traveled is 60 * 2 = 120 miles.

Then, it drives 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance traveled is 30 * 1 = 30 miles.

The total distance traveled is 120 + 30 = 150 miles.

The total time taken is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time, which is 150 / 3 = 50 mph.

"To find out how much potting soil Bob needs, we need to calculate the volume of the raised beds. 

The volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised beds) is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height. 

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 8 * 2 * 2
Volume = 32 cubic feet

Since each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, we need to divide the total volume by 2 to find out how many bags Bob needs.

Number of bags = Total volume / Volume per bag
Number of bags = 32 / 2
Number of bags = 16

Now, we need to multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag to find the total cost.

Now, let's add up the total weight of all the feed: 
2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds

The farmer's truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips he needs to make, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:
3400 / 2250 = 1.51

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, he'll need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is 'x'. 

Since Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, and he gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus 2 extra, we can write the equation as:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras cover, we need to first find the total length of the remoras. Since there are 2 remoras, each 6 inches long, the total length of the remoras is 2 x 6 = 12 inches.

Now, we need to convert the length of the remoras to feet. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so 12 inches is equal to 1 foot. 

The shark is 10 feet long. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras cover, we divide the length of the remoras (1 foot) by the length of the shark (10 feet) and multiply by 100. 

(1 / 10) x 100 = 10%

The combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length."
"To find the total number of students, we need to know that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer. This means one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. 

If 20 students do not have a desktop computer, and this represents one-fourth of the total number of students, we can set up the equation:

1/4 * total_students = 20

To solve for total_students, we multiply both sides by 4:

total_students = 20 * 4
total_students = 80

So, there are 80 students at that grade level."
"To find out how long Jason has to walk each day, we need to divide the total time it takes to break in the shoes (240 minutes) by the number of days he has to do it (3 weeks).

First, we need to convert weeks to days. There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is 3 x 7 = 21 days.

Now, we divide the total time (240 minutes) by the number of days (21):

240 minutes / 21 days = 11.43 minutes per day

So, Jason needs to walk for approximately 11.43 minutes each day to break in the new shoes."
"To find out how many books each child got, we need to first find out how many books Sarah bought. 

She spent $300 on books and each book costs $15. 

300 ÷ 15 = 20

So, Sarah bought 20 books. 

Now, she gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids. 

20 ÷ 4 = 5

Each child got 5 books."
"To find out how many kids aren't allergic to anything, we need to subtract the total number of kids allergic to something from the total number of kids in the class.

First, we need to find out the total number of kids allergic to something. We know 9 kids are allergic to dairy and 6 are allergic to peanuts. But we need to subtract the kids allergic to both because they are counted twice. 

So, the total number of kids allergic to something is 9 + 6 - 3 = 12.

Now, we subtract the total number of kids allergic to something from the total number of kids in the class. 

32 - 12 = 20

So, 20 kids aren't allergic to anything.

"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to multiply the number of groups by the number of employees in each group and then add the number of tour guides.

There are 3 groups with 200 employees each, so 3 x 200 = 600 employees.

Each group has 7 tour guides, so 3 x 7 = 21 tour guides.

The total number of people going on the tour is 600 employees + 21 tour guides = 621.

621"
"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets, hotel, and food. 

The plane tickets cost $5000 each, and they are going for 2 people, so the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 x $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. 20% of $1500 is 0.2 x $1500 = $300. So the hotel costs $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day. For 3 days, the hotel costs 3 x $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the cost of the plane tickets plus the cost of the hotel, which is $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

"To find out how much more they need to earn, we need to add the money Keegan and Tashay have already earned. 

Keegan earned $83 and Tashay earned $91. 
$83 + $91 = $174

Their goal is $200. To find out how much more they need, we subtract the amount they have from the goal. 

$200 - $174 = $26

They need to earn $26 more to reach their goal."
"Gabriel has 20 songs on his player. Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, so Luri has 3 x 20 = 60 songs. 

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add, we need to subtract the number of songs Luri has from the number of songs Gabriel can add. 

Gabriel can add 100 - 20 = 80 songs. Luri can add 60 - 60 = 0 songs. 

So, Luri can add 80 fewer songs than Gabriel can add.

"To find the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to multiply the number of oranges he ate by the amount he gave up for each orange.

Stetson ate 2/5 of the oranges, and they picked 60 oranges. 

First, we need to find 2/5 of 60. 
2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

Since Stetson gave up $10 for each orange, we multiply 24 by 10.

24 * 10 = 240

The total amount of money Stetson gave up is 240 dollars."
"To find out how much Jillian's handbag cost, we need to first calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes. 

3 times the cost of her shoes is 3 * 80 = 240.

Since her handbag cost $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes, we subtract 20 from 240. 

240 - 20 = 220.

So, Jillian's handbag cost $220.

The final answer is: 220"
"To find out how many hours James runs a week, we need to multiply the number of miles he runs per day by the number of days he runs per week.

He runs 12 miles a day and runs 5 days a week. 

12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Now, we need to find out how many hours he runs per week. We know he runs 10 miles per hour.

60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week

The answer is 6."
"To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in a day. 

Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal, and he feeds them twice a day. So, one horse eats 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day. 

Since Uncle Ben has four horses, the total amount of oats they eat in a day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds. 

Now, we need to find out how many days he needs to feed them. He needs to feed them for 5 days. 

So, the total amount of oats needed is 40 * 5 = 200 pounds. 

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we need to divide 200 by 50 to find out how many bags he needs. 

200 / 50 = 4 

He needs 4 bags of oats for his horses for five days."
"To find the number of girl Pomeranians, we need to first find the total number of Pomeranians.

Now, let's divide by 3: 
-30 / 3 = -10

The average highest temperature of these 3 countries is -10."
"To find out how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we need to first calculate the remaining amount he needs to save.

The toy car costs $12 and he already has $4, so the remaining amount is $12 - $4 = $8.

He promises to save $2 daily, so we need to divide the remaining amount by the daily savings.

$8 ÷ $2 = 4

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money."
"To find out how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we need to subtract the number of eggs he can place from the total number of eggs.

"To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to first find the total cost of 2 packs of razors. 

Two packs of razors cost 2 * $4.00 = $8.00. 

Since the razors are on sale for buy one get one free, we can get 4 razors for $8.00. 

The $2.00 coupon can be applied to the total cost of 2 packs of razors, so the total cost after the coupon is $8.00 - $2.00 = $6.00.

Since we have 4 razors, we can divide the total cost by 4 to find the cost of each individual razor. $6.00 / 4 = $1.50. 

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100. $1.50 * 100 = 150 cents.

The final answer is 150."
"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each layer and add them together.

The bottom layer has 4 girls, and the average height is 64"" (since 9 out of 10 girls are 64"" tall). So, the total height of the bottom layer is 4 * 64"" = 256"".

The next layer has 3 girls standing on top of the 4, and the average height is also 64"" (since the 10th girl is 60"" tall, but we're considering the average height of the 9 girls who are 64"" tall). So, the total height of this layer is 3 * 64"" = 192"".

The next layer has 2 girls standing on top of the 3, and the average height is again 64"" (for the same reason as before). So, the total height of this layer is 2 * 64"" = 128"".

Now, we add the heights of all the layers together: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" = 576"".

To convert this to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot): 576"" / 12 = 48 feet.

The human pyramid is 48 feet tall."
"Charisma gets up and walks for 5 minutes every hour. There are 24 hours in a day. She works 8 hours a day. So, she gets up and walks 8 times a day.

Since she walks 5 minutes each time, she walks 40 * 5 = 200 minutes."
"To find Angela's current age, we need to first find out how old she will be in four years. Since Brett is 14 now, in four years he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old. 

Since Angela will be three times as old as Brett in four years, we multiply Brett's age in four years by 3. 18 * 3 = 54. 

So Angela will be 54 years old in four years. To find her current age, we subtract 4 from 54. 54 - 4 = 50.

"To find out how many oranges they have, we need to add the number of oranges Ashley and Brianne brought. 

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so Ashley has 5 x 10 = 50 oranges. 

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

In total, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, they can make 120 / 3 = 40 pies.

"To find the cost of the first venue, we need to add the flat fee to the cost of food.  The cost of food at the first venue is $5 per guest, so the total cost is $200 + $5x, where x is the number of guests.

The cost of the second venue is $25 per guest, so the total cost is $25x.

To find when the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set the two equations equal to each other and solve for x.

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

So, 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Bodhi found x insects. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found x/2 insects. Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found x/2 + 7 insects.

We know that the total number of insects they found is 43. So, we can set up the equation:

x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms:

2x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find out how many David and Lily found. David found x/2 = 18/2 = 9 insects. Lily found x/2 + 7 = 18/2 + 7 = 11 insects.

"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma. 

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and her grandma used 1/2 of a skein. 

First, we need to convert the fractions to have the same denominator. Since 1/4 is the same as 2/8, and 1/2 is the same as 4/8, we can add them together.

2/8 + 4/8 = 6/8

Since there are 8 eighths in a whole, we can convert 6/8 to a whole by dividing 6 by 8, which is 0.75. 

So, they used 0.75 skeins of yarn altogether. 

Now, we need to multiply 0.75 by the total yards in a skein, which is 364. 

0.75 * 364 = 273 

The answer is 273."
"To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to add the gifts she bought initially and the additional gifts.

"To find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost, we need to know how much she paid for the other two packs of gum. 

She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum and half of that for a pack of green apple gum. Half of $2 is $1. So, she paid $1 for the green apple gum. 

She paid $2 for grape gum and $1 for green apple gum, so she paid $2 + $1 = $3 for the two packs of gum that weren't strawberry. 

She paid $7 in total, so the cost of the strawberry gum is $7 - $3 = $4. 

Since she bought two packs of strawberry gum, each pack of strawberry gum cost $4 / 2 = $2.

"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood.

For 2 x 4 wood, he gets 200 sticks and it costs $4. 
Cost per stick = $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick

For 2 x 8 wood, he gets 400 sticks and it costs $6. 
Cost per stick = $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick

Since $0.015 is less than $0.02, Frederick should buy 2 x 8 wood to get the most popsicle sticks for his money.

He can buy 2 x 8 wood with $24. 
2 x 8 wood costs $6 each, so he can buy 24 / 6 = 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood.

He can get 4 x 400 = 1600 sticks from 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood.

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total number of raisins by the amount needed for one batch of oatmeal cookies. 

First, we need to convert 3/4 to a decimal. 3/4 is equal to 0.75. 

Now, we divide the total number of raisins (27) by the amount needed for one batch of oatmeal cookies (0.75). 

27 ÷ 0.75 = 36

So, Heather can make 36 batches of oatmeal cookies."
"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her current and future weekly consumption.

Current weekly consumption: 
12 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatt-hours per week

Future weekly consumption: 
12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour
14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatt-hours per week

Current weekly bill: 
84 kilowatt-hours per week * $1.50 per kilowatt-hour = $126 per week

Future weekly bill: 
98 kilowatt-hours per week * $1.50 per kilowatt-hour = $147 per week

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $147 - $126 = $21."
"To find out how many hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we need to first find out how many hours it takes for one person to paint a whole house. 

If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then one person can paint a whole house in 10 days. 

Now, if one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, then 5 people can paint a whole house in 10 / 5 = 2 days. 

Since there are 24 hours in a day, 5 people can paint a whole house in 2 * 24 = 48 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many chairs Ophelia and Jenna have. 

Since Ophelia has 20 sofas and they have 2 fewer sofas than chairs, Ophelia has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Now, we add the number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have. 
20 (Ophelia's sofas) + 22 (Ophelia's chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs) = 108

The total number of sofas and chairs that they have is 108."
"To find out how many CDs Tom could have bought if he didn't buy the headphone set, we need to subtract the cost of the headphone set from the total amount he paid. 

First, we need to find the cost of the headphone set. We know Tom paid $48 in total and $4 for the CD. So, the cost of the headphone set is $48 - $4 = $44.

Now, we need to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set. We know the cost of one CD is $4. So, the number of CDs Tom could have bought is $44 / $4 = 11.

Therefore, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the hours for each week and add them up.

Josh worked out for 4 hours every week for 6 weeks. 
6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 24 hours

He also worked out for 5 hours for 2 weeks. 
2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours

And he worked out for 6 hours in one week. 
1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours

Now, let's add up all the hours: 
24 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours = 40 hours

The total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is 40 hours."
"To find the number of passengers after the second stop, we need to follow the steps:

1. Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so there are 48 - 8 = 40 passengers left.
3. 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get on the bus, so 5 * 8 = 40 people get on. Now, there are 40 + 40 = 80 passengers.
4. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so there are 80 - 21 = 59 passengers left.
5. 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus, which means 1/3 of the number of passengers who got off (21) get on. So, 21 / 3 = 7 passengers get on. Now, there are 59 + 7 = 66 passengers.

The final answer is: 66"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jame's current age be x.

In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5) + 5 = x + 10 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 10 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation:

x + 10 = 2x + 5

Subtracting x from both sides:

10 = x + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

5 = x

So, Jame's current age is 5 years.

Now, let's find Jame's cousin's current age. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be x + 10 = 5 + 10 = 15 years old.

The age difference between Jame and his cousin is 15 - 5 = 10 years.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the cost of one monitor, we need to first find the cost of the printer. 

Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we subtract $400 from the cost of the computer to find the cost of the printer. 
$1,100 - $400 = $700

Now that we know the cost of the printer, we can find the total cost of the computer and the printer. 
$1,100 + $700 = $1,800

We know the total cost of all three items is $2,400. To find the cost of the monitors, we subtract the cost of the computer and printer from the total cost. 
$2,400 - $1,800 = $600

Since there are 2 monitors, we divide the remaining cost by 2 to find the cost of one monitor. 
$600 / 2 = $300

The cost of one monitor is $300."
"To find out how many seashells the girls brought, we need to first find out how many seashells the girls brought in total. 

The boys brought 60 shells each, and there are 20 boys. So, the boys brought 60 * 20 = 1200 shells in total.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 1200 + 4 * 60 = 1200 + 240 = 1440 shells in total.

Since there are 10 girls, we divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by 10 to find out how many seashells each girl brought. 1440 / 10 = 144.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

We know that George has 3 candies left after eating 5 candies. So, before eating 5 candies, George had 3 + 5 = 8 candies.

Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick had 2 * 8 = 16 candies.

The final answer is 16."
"To find Anne's age, we need to find Alyana's age first. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, Alyana is 10 - 4 = 6 years old. 

Now, since Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, Anne is 6 + 2 = 8 years old.

"To find the thickness of the third book, we need to subtract 5 mm from the thickness of the second book. 
The second book is 50 mm thick, so the third book is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.

The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book. The first book is 31 mm thick, so the fourth book is 2 x 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, we add up the thickness of all four books: 
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm.

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we need to add up the vlogs she has already made. 

She made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. 

18 + 21 + 15 = 54

So, Emma has already made 54 vlogs. To reach 72 vlogs, she needs to make 72 - 54 = 18 more vlogs."
"To find out how much you paid, first, you need to calculate 20% of the $50 bill. 

20% of $50 is 0.20 * 50 = $10.

Then, you add the 20% tip to the original bill. 

$50 + $10 = $60.

So, you paid $60."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much each boy initially got. 
$18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy added $5 to his share, so he now has $6 + $5 = $11. 
The next day, he added another $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

He spent $8 from his total, so he now has $21 - $8 = $13.

He tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8, so he now has $13 * 3 = $39.

The final answer is 39."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much Elvis saves in the first half of the month. 

Since Elvis has a monthly target of $1125, and there are 30 days in April, we can divide the total target by 30 to find the daily savings in the first half of the month. 

$1125 / 15 days = $75 per day in the first half of the month.

Now, Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half of the month. So, we multiply the daily savings in the first half by 2.

$75 * 2 = $150 per day in the second half of the month.

"To find out how much change Verna received, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruits she bought.

Three apples at $1.50 each will be 3 x $1.50 = $4.50
Five oranges at $0.80 each will be 5 x $0.80 = $4.00
Six peaches at $0.75 each will be 6 x $0.75 = $4.50

Now, let's add the costs of all the fruits together: $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Verna gave $20, so the change she received is $20 - $13.00 = $7.00."
"To find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, we need to calculate the total amount of money they each get.

Jairus gets $0.8 per task, so for 20 tasks, he gets 20 x $0.8 = $16.
Jenny gets $0.5 per task, so for 20 tasks, she gets 20 x $0.5 = $10.

Now, we subtract Jenny's total from Jairus' total to find the difference: $16 - $10 = $6.

The answer is 6."
"To find out how much Jeff gets, we need to divide the total amount of money, which is 100 dollars, by 5. 

First, we know that Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. If we let x be the amount of money Brad gets, then Jeff gets 4x. 

We know that x + 4x = 100, because the total amount of money is 100 dollars. 

Now, we can solve for x: 
5x = 100
x = 20

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.

80"
"To find out how many miles Jeff walks, we need to calculate the total distance he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

Since Jeff walks to work and back, the distance he walks each day is 2 times the distance to his work. So, the distance he walks each day is 2 x 3 miles = 6 miles.

Since he works 5 times a week, the total distance he walks in a week is 6 miles/day x 5 days/week = 30 miles.

The final answer is 30."
"To find out how many letters Elise has written, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Elise writes the alphabet twice, which means she writes 26 letters twice, so that's 26 * 2 = 52 letters.
2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet, which is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.
3. After that, she re-writes everything she has already written, which is 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

So, in total, Elise has written 65 letters.

"To find out how many families will be notified during the fourth round of calls, we need to understand the pattern of the phone tree. 

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. 
In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 other families, so 3 * 3 = 9 new families are notified. 
In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 other families, so 9 * 3 = 27 new families are notified. 
In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 other families, so 27 * 3 = 81 new families are notified.

So, in total, 3 (initial) + 9 (second round) + 27 (third round) + 81 (fourth round) = 120 families will be notified during the fourth round of calls.

Since James's play set has 80 toys, a set five times larger would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys. 

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than that, so he needs 400 + 2 = 402 toys. 

Jonathan currently has 402 - 2 = 400 toys.

Five notebooks cost 5 x $1.50 = $7.50. 
Two pens cost 2 x $0.25 = $0.50. 
One calculator costs $12. 
One geometry set costs $10. 

Now, we add the costs of all the items: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

Since the shop gives a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $30. 
10% of $30 is 0.1 x $30 = $3.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $30 - $3 = $27.

"To find out how many action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how much he spent on wooden action figures and plastic action figures separately.

Peter spent $5 each on wooden action figures from Sunday to Wednesday. There are 3 days in this period, so he spent 3 * $5 = $15 on wooden action figures.

He has $70 initially and spent $15 on wooden action figures, so he has $70 - $15 = $55 left.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. There are 3 days in this period, so he will spend 3 * $2 = $6 on plastic action figures.

He has $55 left and spent $6 on plastic action figures, so he has $55 - $6 = $49 left.

Since he can only buy whole action figures, we need to divide the remaining money by the cost of a plastic action figure ($2) to find out how many he can buy. $49 / $2 = 24.5. Since he can't buy half a figure, he can buy 24 plastic action figures.

In total, Peter bought 3 wooden action figures and 24 plastic action figures. So, he will have 3 + 24 = 27 action figures by the end of the week.

"To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we need to calculate the total number of roses he needs to supply to the flower shops every week and then multiply it by 4 (since there are 4 weeks in a month).

The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. So, the total number of roses Ford needs to supply per week is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses Ford needs to supply in a month is 65 * 4 = 260 roses.

Ford grows 40 roses every week. To find out how many roses he lacks, we subtract the number of roses he grows from the total number of roses he needs to supply in a month: 260 - 40 = 220.

Ford lacks 220 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."

First, let's calculate the total cost. They buy 1 loaf of bread for $3.00 and 10 sandwiches, so the cost of bread is $3.00. They also spend $30.00 on cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches, so the total cost is $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue. They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each, so the total revenue is 10 x $7.00 = $70.00.

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. So, the net profit is $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00.

"To find out how many muffin crayons Kate can make, we need to know how many crayons she has. She has 3 boxes of 64 crayons. 

3 * 64 = 192 crayons

Since she melts 8 crayons together, we need to divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find out how many muffin crayons she can make.

192 / 8 = 24 muffin crayons

Now, we need to multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price per muffin to find out how much money Kate can make.

24 * $1.50 = $36

The final answer is 36."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total area of the room and then add the costs of the carpet, padding, removal, and installation.

The area of the room is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 * $12 = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 * $2 = $432.

The cost of removal is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removal is 216 * $4 = $864.

The cost of installation is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installation is 216 * $34 = $7344.

The total cost is $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $10512.

The final answer is: 10512"
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw over the week and divide it by the number of days.

Let's add up the total number of birds:
Day 1 and 2: 50 birds
Day 3: 0 birds
Day 4 and 5: 120 birds
Day 6: 20 birds
Day 7: 90 birds

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

There are 7 days in a week. To find the average, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days:
Average = Total number of birds / Number of days
Average = 280 / 7
Average = 40

The average number of birds Mack saw in a day is 40."
"To find the final value of the number train, we need to follow the steps given in the problem.

1. The starting value is 20.
2. Half of the starting value is 20 / 2 = 10.
3. This half value is divided by 5: 10 / 5 = 2.
4. The resulting value (2) is multiplied by the starting value minus 12: 2 * (20 - 12) = 2 * 8 = 16.

The final value of the number train is 16."
"The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards than he has, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

"To find the correct temperature, we need to calculate the percentage difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature. 

First, we find the difference: 468 - 450 = 18. 
Then, we divide the difference by the set temperature: 18 / 450 = 0.04. 
Now, we multiply this by 100 to get the percentage: 0.04 * 100 = 4%. 
Since the oven is off by 4%, we need to find 4% of the recipe's temperature. 
4% of 520 is 0.04 * 520 = 20.80. 
So, Maggie should set the oven to 520 + 20.80 = 540.80."

"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house value and subtract that from Herb's house value. 

Herb's house value is $76,000. 
30% of $76,000 is 0.3 * 76,000 = $22,800. 
Juan's house value is $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.

Now, let's add the values of both houses. 
$76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200.

"To find the total number of utensils, we need to first find out how many dishes Judy brought. Since Judy bought a dozen cups and twice as many dishes, she must have bought 12 * 2 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of dishes is 24 (Judy's dishes) + 44 (her friend's dishes) = 68 dishes.

Since Judy brought 12 cups and her friend brought 40 cups, the total number of cups is 12 + 40 = 52 cups.

The total number of utensils is 68 (dishes) + 52 (cups) = 120.

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to first find the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts. 

Since each box is $100.00 and it's 10% off, the discount is $10.00. 

So, the cost of 1 box is $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00. 

The cost of 2 boxes is $90.00 * 2 = $180.00. 

Since 90 contacts last 45 days, we need to find out how many days 180 contacts will last. 

180 / 90 = 2. 

So, 180 contacts will last 2 times 45 days, which is 90 days. 

Now, we need to find the cost of each pair of contacts. 

Since 90 contacts last 90 days, each pair of contacts will last 45 days. 

So, the cost of each pair of contacts is $180.00 / 2 = $90.00."
"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate their total hours worked and multiply it by the hourly wage.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. 
Her earnings would be 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. 
He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. 
His total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours. 
His earnings would be 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

"To find out how many calories Hannah burns, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running. 

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour, so she burns 2 * 500 = 1000 calories from aerobics. 

She also spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour, so she burns 1 * 600 = 600 calories from running. 

In total, she burns 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since she needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times she needs to drink water. 

1600 / 200 = 8

So, she needs to drink 8 times 100 ml, which is 8 * 100 = 800 ml of water."
"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of jelly beans of each color. Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is B, the number of red jelly beans is R, and the number of green jelly beans is G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write an equation:

B + R + G = 4500

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write another equation:

R = 0.99B

We also know that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write another equation:

G = 1.01B

Now we have three equations and three variables. We can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99(1500)
R = 1485

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of green jelly beans:

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01(1500)
G = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1509 - 1485
G - R = 24

Then, she invited 10 of her friends, and 8 of them brought their spouses. So, that's 10 + 8 = 18 more people.

Now, let's add all the people together: 
100 (initially invited) + 200 (friends of the initially invited) + 10 (her friends) + 18 (their spouses) = 328

On Amazon, the boots cost $16 and shipping costs $4, so the total cost is $16 + $4 = $20.

On eBay, the boots cost $13 and shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, which is $4 x 2 = $8. So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Let Jerry's current age be x. 

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation: 
x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:
x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides, we get:
0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get:
10 = x

So Jerry's current age is 10.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

The final answer is 13."
"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown.

The base price of the implants is $2000 each, and George needs 2 implants, so the total cost of the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000.

The crown costs an extra $500, so the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we can divide the amount he still needs by his hourly wage to find out how many hours he needs to work: $3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"

"To find out how many times the tire will rotate in a year, we need to multiply the number of miles driven per month by 12. 

400 miles/month * 12 months/year = 4800 miles/year

Now, we need to find out how many times the tire rotates in a year. 

Since the tire rotates 725 times every 2 miles, we need to divide the total miles driven in a year by 2.

4800 miles/year / 2 miles/rotation = 2400 rotations/year

Now, we need to find out how many years the tire will last. 

Total rotations the tire can undergo = 10,440,000 rotations

Number of rotations the tire will undergo in a year = 2400 rotations/year

Now, divide the total rotations the tire can undergo by the rotations it will undergo in a year.

"So, Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour. He works 10 hours a day. That means he sells 15 * 10 = 150kg of meat per day. 

Now, he has 750kg of meat from the bull. To find out how many days it will take him to sell the meat, we need to divide the total weight of the meat by the weight of meat he sells per day. 

750 / 150 = 5

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

"To find the total number of seats, we need to multiply the number of rows by the number of seats in each row. 

4 rows * 18 seats per row = 72 seats

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators. 
One-fourth of 72 seats = 72 / 4 = 18 seats

The remaining seats are 72 - 18 = 54 seats

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents. 
One-third of 54 seats = 54 / 3 = 18 seats

The remaining seats are 54 - 18 = 36 seats

These 36 seats are occupied by students.

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we need to first find the total number of street lights. 

There are 4 street lights at each pole and 6 poles at each intersection. So, the total number of street lights at each intersection is 4 * 6 = 24.

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is 24 * 4 = 96.

Now, we need to subtract the number of non-functioning street lights. There are 20 non-functioning street lights. 

So, the total number of functioning street lights is 96 - 20 = 76.

"To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played, we need to add the number of times each DVD has been played.

The first DVD has been played 356 times.
The second DVD has been played 135 times.

Total number of times both DVDs can be played = 356 + 135 = 491

The total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is 491."
"To find the total cost of the physical therapy, we need to calculate the total number of hours John attended therapy and multiply it by the cost per hour.

John attended therapy twice a week for 6 weeks, so the total number of sessions is 2 * 6 = 12 sessions.

Each session is 2 hours long, so the total number of hours is 12 * 2 = 24 hours.

The cost per hour is $125, so the total cost is 24 * 125 = $3000.

"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left, we need to calculate how many pieces he uses throughout the day.

He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since school lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

He also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner. So, that's 2 more pieces.

In total, Jim chews 4 + 2 = 6 pieces of gum throughout the day.

He starts with 20 pieces of gum. After using 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

Then, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 7, so he gives 7 pieces to his sister.

Now, he has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find Charmaine's age 4 years from now, we need to add 4 to her current age. 

First, we need to find her current age. Since she will be 16 in 12 years, we subtract 12 from 16. 

16 - 12 = 4

Now, we add 4 to her current age. 

4 + 4 = 8

So, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now.

"To find out how much more the basketball coach spent, we need to calculate the total amount spent by each coach.

The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs for $3 each, so the total amount spent is 9 x $3 = $27.

The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs for $14 each, so the total amount spent is 8 x $14 = $112.

To find out how much more the basketball coach spent, we subtract the amount spent by the baseball coach from the amount spent by the basketball coach: $112 - $27 = $85.

"To find out how many flowers have bloomed, we need to multiply the number of rows by the number of flowers in each row and then multiply that by the fraction of flowers that have bloomed.

Number of rows: 10
Number of flowers in each row: 20
Fraction of flowers that have bloomed: 4/5

First, multiply the number of rows by the number of flowers in each row: 
10 * 20 = 200 flowers

Then, multiply the result by the fraction of flowers that have bloomed: 
200 * 4/5 = 200 * 0.8 = 160 flowers

So, 160 flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb per second to Mb per second. 

Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can divide her speed by 1000 to get her speed in Mb per second. 

20 kb/second ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb/second

Now, we need to convert her speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour. 

So, there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour. 

Multiply her speed in Mb per second by 3600 to get her speed in Mb per hour. 

0.02 Mb/second * 3600 seconds = 72 Mb/hour

The final answer is 72."
"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days separately.

On the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed on the first three days is 10 * 3 = 30.

On the remaining days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. There are 5 remaining days, so the total number of cars towed on the remaining days is 6 * 5 = 30.

Now, we add the total number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days to get the total number of cars towed that week. 30 + 30 = 60.

"To find out how many years it will take Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to subtract his current height from the required height and divide by his annual growth rate.

First, we need to convert Adam's height from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 40 inches is 40 / 12 = 3.33 feet.

The required height is 4 feet. To find the difference, we subtract Adam's height from the required height: 4 - 3.33 = 0.67 feet.

Now, we divide the difference by Adam's annual growth rate of 2 inches (or 0.17 feet). 0.67 / 0.17 = 3.94 years.

So, it will take Adam approximately 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit first. 

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars. So, they paid 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500 per car. 

The cost of the cars for James is 10 * $7,500 = $75,000. 

The profit is the selling price minus the cost. The selling price is 10 * $25,000 = $250,000. 

So, the profit is $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000. 

James got a 10% commission on the profit. So, his commission is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

The final answer is 17,500."
"To find out how many riders can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet, we need to calculate 25% of 100. 

25% of 100 is 0.25 * 100 = 25.

Since 60% of these riders are women, we need to find 40% of 25 (100% - 60% = 40%). 

40% of 25 is 0.4 * 25 = 10.

So, 10 women can stay upright on the wave.

The number of men who can stay upright is the difference between the total number of riders who can stay upright and the number of women who can stay upright. 

10 (women) - 10 (women) = 0 men.

The answer is 0."
"To find the price of the gold jewel, I need to multiply the price of the diamond jewel by 4/5. 

Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * $2000 = $1600

The price of the silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel. 

Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400 = $1200

Now, I need to add the prices of all three jewels to find the total price.

Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200 = $4800

The total price for all three jewels is $4800."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many truck stamps and rose stamps Max bought. 

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

Now, we add up the number of stamps Max bought: 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45 stamps.

"To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed between them. 

Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed: 75 - 70 = 5 miles per hour. 

Now, we divide the distance between them (75 miles) by their relative speed (5 miles per hour): 75 / 5 = 15 hours.

It will take Tom 15 hours to catch up with Bob."
"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we need to first find out how many fish Darren caught. 

Naomi caught 17 fish, and Darren caught 6 less than Naomi. So, Darren caught 17 - 6 = 11 fish.

Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. So, Tommy caught 11 + 3 = 14 fish.

The final answer is 14."
"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the total cost of the classes and then subtract the cost per class that his parents are willing to pay.

The total cost of the classes is $60. His parents are willing to pay $10 per class. 

To find out how many classes they are willing to pay for, we divide the total cost by the cost per class: 
$60 ÷ $10 = 6 classes

Since Manny has 10 classes in total, and his parents are only willing to pay for 6 classes, he can miss 10 - 6 = 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

"Since Jewel processes 50 customers a day, and Julie processes twice as fast, Julie processes 50 * 2 = 100 customers a day. 

If they work all 7 days of the week, the total number of customers Jewel processes is 50 * 7 = 350. 
The total number of customers Julie processes is 100 * 7 = 700. 

The total weekly production for the two is 350 + 700 = 1050 customers."
"To find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to first figure out how many miles Reggie ran. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, and Paisley ran 4 miles. So Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

"To find out how much Clyde will pay, we need to calculate the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges separately and then add them together.

First, we find the cost of 5 apples. Since 4 apples cost $5.20, we can divide $5.20 by 4 to get the cost of one apple. 

$5.20 ÷ 4 = $1.30

Now, we multiply the cost of one apple by 5 to get the cost of 5 apples.

$1.30 × 5 = $6.50

Next, we find the cost of 5 oranges. Since 3 oranges cost $3.30, we can divide $3.30 by 3 to get the cost of one orange.

$3.30 ÷ 3 = $1.10

Now, we multiply the cost of one orange by 5 to get the cost of 5 oranges.

$1.10 × 5 = $5.50

Finally, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges together.

$6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price of the truck.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade is $7,500.

Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so leather seats cost $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so running boards cost $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the features: 
$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $42,000.

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $42,000."
"To calculate Tim's new monthly salary, we need to first calculate the raise amount. 

The raise amount is 5% of his current salary, which is 5% of $20000. 
5% of $20000 is 0.05 x $20000 = $1000. 

So, his new monthly salary is $20000 + $1000 = $21000.

The bonus is half a month's salary, which is $20000 / 2 = $10000.

Now, we add the monthly salary and the bonus to get the total monthly income. 
$21000 + $10000 = $31000.

To find the yearly income, we multiply the monthly income by 12. 
$31000 x 12 = $372000.

The final answer is: $372000"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

Since the dress pants cost 1/5 of the cost of a suit, 
1/5 * $750 = $150
10 dress pants * $150 per pant = $1,500

Now, let's calculate the cost of the dress shirts: 
3 shirts * $60 per shirt = $180

Now, let's add the costs together: 
$7,500 + $1,500 + $180 = $9,180

The total cost is $9,180."

"So, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got $2 off. That means she paid 20 - 2 = 18 dollars for the pomegranates. 

The next day, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each, but the store gave her a 10% discount. 10% of 30 is 3, so she paid 30 - 3 = 27 dollars for the pomegranates.

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is 27 - 18 = 9 dollars."
"To find the total amount Ariadne made in the first month, we need to know the sales of green hats. Let's call the sales of green hats 'x'. Since the sales of red hats were half the total sales of green hats, the sales of red hats are x/2.

The total sales of the first month is the sum of the sales of red and green hats, which is x + x/2. We know that the sales of red hats were $400, so we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 400
x = 800

Now that we know the sales of green hats, we can find the total sales of the first month:
Total sales of the first month = x + x/2 = 800 + 400 = 1200

In the second month, the sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month, which is 3/4 * 1200 = 900. 

The total amount Ariadne made in two months is the sum of the sales of both months: 1200 + 900 = 2100.

The final answer is: 2100"
"To find out how much James paid, we need to calculate the total hours he used the carriage. 

He used the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is 4 hours. However, he got 1 hour free, so he actually used 4 - 1 = 3 paid hours.

The first paid hour costs $15. Each hour after that is twice the cost, so the next two hours cost 2 * $15 = $30 each. 

The total cost is $15 + $30 + $30 = $75.

"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to subtract the amount she has in her bank account from her weekly wage.

Weekly wage: $300
Amount in bank account: $420

$300 - $420 = -$120

Since the result is negative, it means that more money was in her bank account than her weekly wage. However, the question asks how many dollars were withheld from her wage. 

To find the amount withheld, we need to subtract the amount in her bank account from her weekly wage. 

$300 - $420 = -$120

Since the result is negative, it means that the amount withheld is $120."
"To find out how many deviled egg halves Lori needs, we need to multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat. 

16 guests * 3 deviled egg halves per guest = 48 deviled egg halves

Since Lori needs 2 deviled egg halves per egg, we need to divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2.

48 deviled egg halves / 2 = 24 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12.

24 eggs / 12 = 2 dozen eggs

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many pages Shiela has left to write, we need to subtract the number of pages she has already written from the total number of pages required.

She has written 1/3 of the paper, and the total number of pages is 15. 

First, we need to find 1/3 of 15. 
1/3 of 15 is 5.

Now, we subtract 5 from 15 to find out how many pages she has left to write.
15 - 5 = 10

So, Shiela has 10 pages left to write.

"To find out how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read per day.

Total pages = 200
Pages per day = 10

Days to finish = Total pages / Pages per day
Days to finish = 200 / 10
Days to finish = 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, he will finish the book 10 days before the deadline.

"To find the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the cost of the plane itself, the monthly rent, and the monthly fuel cost.

The cost of the plane is $150,000. 

The monthly rent is $5000. 

The monthly fuel cost is twice the rent, so it's $5000 * 2 = $10,000.

The total monthly cost is $5000 (rent) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000.

To find the total cost for the first year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12. 

$15,000 * 12 = $180,000.

The total cost of the plane for the first year is $150,000 (plane) + $180,000 (first year's expenses) = $330,000.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the cooking time for beans and pork. 

We know that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. Since it took 30 minutes to cook rice, and it took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

Now, we can find the cooking time for beans. Since beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, we can calculate it as follows: 
Beans cooking time = (Pork cooking time + Rice cooking time) / 2
Beans cooking time = (50 + 30) / 2
Beans cooking time = 80 / 2
Beans cooking time = 40 minutes

Now, we can find the total cooking time by adding the cooking times of all three items: 
Total cooking time = Rice cooking time + Pork cooking time + Beans cooking time
Total cooking time = 30 + 50 + 40
Total cooking time = 120 minutes

"To find the cost of the first mixture, we need to calculate the cost of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. 

Cost of 1/2 pound almonds = 1/2 * $10 = $5
Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts = 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the first mixture = $5 + $5 = $10

To find the cost of the second mixture, we need to calculate the cost of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

Cost of 1/5 pound almonds = 1/5 * $10 = $2
Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts = 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the second mixture = $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures.
Difference in cost = Total cost of the first mixture - Total cost of the second mixture
= $10 - $7
= $3

The final answer is: $3"
"To solve this problem, we need to know the number of legs and heads for each animal. 

Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head. 
Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

Let's say the number of sheep is 's' and the number of geese is 'g'. 

We know that the total number of animal heads is 20, so s + g = 20.

We also know that the total number of animal legs is 70, so 4s + 2g = 70.

We can solve these two equations to find the number of sheep. 

First, we can multiply the first equation by 2 to get 2s + 2g = 40.

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to get 2s = 30.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get s = 15.

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"To find out how much everything cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the donut separately.

First, let's calculate the cost of the coffee. Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee and uses 1 pound per day, he needs 7 pounds of coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

20% of $5 is $1, so the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound. 

7 pounds of coffee will cost 7 x $6 = $42. 

Now, let's add the cost of the donut, which is $2. 

$42 + $2 = $44.

The total cost is $44."
"To find out how much the apple pie cost, we need to subtract the cost of the other items Gus bought from the total amount he spent.

First, let's add up the cost of the items Gus bought: 
2 bags of chips for $2.00 each is 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
Adding the cost of the fried chicken, $8.00, and the soda, $1.00, we get $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount Gus spent, $20.00:
$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The apple pie cost $7.00."

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Aurelia has $120. 
Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, so Kassidy has 3/4 * 120 = 90 dollars. 
Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so Rayna has 90 + 60 = 150 dollars. 

Now, let's add up their money: 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars. 

If they share the money equally, each person will get 360 / 3 = 120 dollars. 

The final answer is 120."

"To find the number of employees who oversee the company, we need to calculate 20% of 20% of the total employees.

First, we find 20% of 50 employees:
20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10

Then, we find 30% of 10 employees:
30% of 10 = 0.30 * 10 = 3

So, there are 3 employees who oversee the company.

"To find the total amount of dry ingredients needed, we need to multiply the amount of each ingredient by the number of muffins.

For flour: 5 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 80 tablespoons
For sugar: 3 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 48 tablespoons
For salt: 0.25 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 4 tablespoons

Now, we add the total amount of each ingredient: 80 + 48 + 4 = 132 tablespoons

The total amount of dry ingredients needed is 132 tablespoons."
"To find out how much candy they have in total, we need to add up the pounds of candy each of them had. 

3 (Robert) + 5 (Cindy) + 4 (Aaron) = 12 pounds

Now, we need to divide the total amount of candy by 3, since they are sharing it equally among themselves.

12 / 3 = 4

So, each of them will have 4 pounds of candy."
"To find out how much change Adam got, we need to calculate the total cost of the candies he bought.

The cost of 7 candies of type A is 7 x $0.5 = $3.50.
The cost of 10 candies of type B is 10 x $0.75 = $7.50.
The total cost of all candies is $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.

Adam paid the cashier $15, so the change he got is $15 - $11 = $4."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Total days in the month: 30
- Good days: 12
- Bad days: 8
- Neutral days: 10 (since 30 - 12 - 8 = 10)

- First eight days were good
- Second eight days were bad
- Third eight days were neutral
- Next three days were good, neutral, and good

Since the first eight days were good, the second eight days were bad, and the third eight days were neutral, that's a total of 24 days accounted for. 

Now, we have 30 - 24 = 6 days left. Out of these 6 days, 3 are good. 

So, the total number of good days in the month is 12 + 3 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find out how many books Sally has, we need to work backwards. 

Janey has 21 books, and she has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has. Let's call the number of books Sally has 'x'. 

So, Janey's books = 2x + 3. We know Janey has 21 books, so 2x + 3 = 21.

Now, we need to solve for x. Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = 18. 

Now, divide both sides by 2: x = 9.

So, Sally has 9 books. 

9"
"To find the number of days, we need to convert the height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 20 feet is equal to 20 x 12 = 240 inches.

Now, we need to find the difference between the target height (600 inches) and the current height (240 inches). 
600 - 240 = 360 inches

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we can divide the difference by the growth rate to find the number of days:
360 / 30 = 12

So, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

James initially had 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he had 1 toy per dog. 

Then, he bought more toys for the 8 additional dogs, so now he has 1 toy per dog. 

After that, he came back to find that there were twice as many dogs as before, so there were 2 * 8 = 16 dogs. 

However, 3 dogs were gone, so now there are 16 - 3 = 13 dogs.

Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 13 toys in total.

"To find out how much money Skyler invested, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we find out how much Dylan invested. Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, which is 2/5 * 1200 = 480 dollars.

2. Now, we subtract Dylan's investment from the total amount to find the remaining amount. Remaining amount = 1200 - 480 = 720 dollars.

3. Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount. Frances' investment = 2/3 * 720 = 480 dollars.

4. Now, we subtract Frances' investment from the remaining amount to find Skyler's investment. Skyler's investment = 720 - 480 = 240 dollars.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find out how many signatures the sisters need to collect, we need to first find out how many signatures they already have. 

Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. So, the total number of signatures they have is 20 + 44 = 64.

The sisters want to reach 100 signatures by the end of the summer. To find out how many more signatures they need, we subtract the number of signatures they already have from their goal. 

100 - 64 = 36

So, the sisters need 36 more signatures to reach their goal."
"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we need to first find out how much she earns in one day. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns 2 x $10 = $20 per hour.

If Karen works 3 hours per day, then she earns $20 x 3 = $60 per day.

In two days, she will earn $60 x 2 = $120.

"To find out how many hash browns you can make from 96 potatoes, we need to divide the total number of potatoes by the number of potatoes it takes to make 36 hash browns.

First, we find out how many groups of 6 potatoes we have: 96 ÷ 6 = 16

Since each group makes 36 hash browns, we multiply the number of groups by 36: 16 * 36 = 576

So, you can make 576 hash browns from 96 potatoes.

576"
"To find the total weight of the 9 people, we need to multiply the weight of one adult by 9. 

9 adults * 80 kg = 720 kg

The elevator can support 700 kg, so we need to subtract the maximum load from the total weight of the people.

720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg

They will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Katarina has 68 cookies.
- Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.
- Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.
- Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

To find the total number of cookies, we add the number of cookies each person has: 
68 (Katarina) + 73 (Max) + 61 (Cookie Monster) + 96 (Summer) = 298 cookies.

298"
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to reverse the process of extending it by 50% and adding 20cm.

Let's call the original length of the dress 'x'. 

First, we subtract the 20cm added to the bottom: x - 20cm.

Then, we divide the result by 1.5 (since it was extended by 50%): (x - 20) / 1.5.

We know the final length is 140cm, so we set up the equation: (x - 20) / 1.5 = 140.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 1.5: x - 20 = 210.

Then, we add 20 to both sides: x = 230.

So, the original length of the dress was 230cm.

"To find the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the time it took him to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode.

Since Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour in ""turtle"" mode, he can mow half the lawn in 0.5 hours. 

In ""rabbit"" mode, he can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. So, he can mow half the lawn in 20 minutes.

Now, we add the time it took him to mow half the lawn in both modes: 0.5 hours + 20 minutes. 

To add 0.5 hours and 20 minutes, we need to convert 0.5 hours to minutes. 0.5 hours is equal to 30 minutes. 

So, 30 minutes + 20 minutes is 50 minutes.

Therefore, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow half the lawn in both modes.

"Let's break this down. We have one twin and one triplet. Let's say the age of the triplet is x. Since there's one twin that's 7 years older than one triplet, the twin's age would be x + 7.

The combined ages of the twin and the triplet are 44. So, we can write the equation: x + (x + 7) = 44.

Combine like terms: 2x + 7 = 44.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2x = 37.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 18.5.

Since x represents the age of the triplet, the age of the twin would be x + 7 = 18.5 + 7 = 25.5.

The final answer is 25.5."
"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to add up the time he has spent on his homework and subtract that from the total time he has before dinner.

First, let's convert 3 hours to minutes. 3 hours is equal to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time John spent on his homework: 
20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes.

Now, let's subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner: 
180 minutes (before dinner) - 80 minutes (homework) = 100 minutes.

John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To find the cost of 10 lollipops, we need to multiply the cost of one lollipop by 10. 
10 lollipops * $0.40 = $4.00

We already know the cost of 4 candies is $3.20. To find the cost of 10 candies, we multiply the cost of 4 candies by 2.5 (10/4).
$3.20 * 2.5 = $8.00

Now, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies.
$4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $12.00."
"To find out how many coins Rong has saved, we need to multiply the number of coins he saves per month by the number of months in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so Rong saves 20 * 12 = 240 coins per year.

Since Rong has been saving for 10 years, he has saved 240 * 10 = 2400 coins.

Now, let's find out how many coins Neil saves per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Neil saves 28 * 12 = 336 coins per year. Since Neil has been saving for 10 years, he has saved 336 * 10 = 3360 coins.

To find the total number of coins they have, we need to add the coins saved by Rong and Neil. 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

The final answer is: 5760"
"To find out how much John leaves with, we need to calculate the total cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. 

The cost of 2 vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 
The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so it's 0.6 * (vaccines + heartworm check). 
Let's assume the total bill is x. 
So, 0.6 * (x) = 0.6 * (40 + 0.6x). 
Simplifying the equation, we get 0.6x = 24 + 0.36x. 
Subtracting 0.36x from both sides, we get 0.24x = 24. 
Dividing both sides by 0.24, we get x = 100. 
So, the total bill is $100. 
The cost of the heartworm check is 0.6 * 100 = $60. 
The total cost is $40 (vaccines) + $60 (heartworm check) = $100. 
John brought $125, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25."
"To find the price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together. 

First, we know that one banana costs twice as much as an apple, and one apple costs $0.5. So, one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

Now, we know that one orange costs three times as much as a banana, so one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

The crate contains 5 bananas, so the cost of bananas is 5 * $1 = $5.

The crate contains 12 apples, so the cost of apples is 12 * $0.5 = $6.

The crate contains 7 oranges, so the cost of oranges is 7 * $3 = $21.

Now, we add the cost of all the fruits together: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

The price for such a crate of fruit is $32."
"To find the total number of squares, we need to find the number of each color. 

The comforter has 14 red squares. 
There are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so there are 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares. 
There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so there are 18 + 6 = 24 green squares. 
There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so there are 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, we add up the number of squares of each color: 
14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

The total number of squares is 68."
"To find out how many chairs Mia needs, we first need to know how many regular chairs she has. Since there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, she has 5 * 8 = 40 regular chairs.

"To find out how many points the class is missing, we need to calculate the total points collected by all the students. 

First, we know Adam has 50 points. Betty collected 30% more than Adam, so Betty has 50 + 0.3 * 50 = 65 points.

Now, we know Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom, so Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, we add up all the points: 50 (Adam) + 65 (Betty) + 35 (Tom) + 105 (Marta) = 255 points.

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the threshold: 400 - 255 = 145 points.

"To find out how many fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the total number of fireworks set off in the city and in her backyard.

First, let's calculate the total number of fireworks set off in the city. There are 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks is 15 x 20 = 300.

Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard, so the total number of fireworks in her backyard is 3 x 5 = 15.

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to calculate 40% of 300. To do this, we multiply 300 by 0.4, which is 300 x 0.4 = 120.

Now, we add the number of fireworks Hannah can see from the city (120) and the number of fireworks in her backyard (15). So, 120 + 15 = 135.

The final answer is: 135"

There are 14 people in total (Aiden and his 12 friends, plus the 7 more friends they meet up with). 

Each seat can hold 2 drinks and 3 snacks. Since there are 14 people, we can divide 14 by 5 (2+3) to find out how many sets of drinks and snacks are needed. 14 / 5 = 2.8, but since we can't buy a fraction of a set, we'll round up to 3 sets.

So, 3 sets of drinks and snacks are needed. Each set costs $2, so 3 sets will cost 3 x $2 = $6.

The total amount of money spent on snacks and drinks is $6."
"To find out how much gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to first find out how much gravel Gissela's truck can carry. 

Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds of gravel. Gordy's truck can carry 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.

The total amount of gravel the three trucks can carry together is 11,600 pounds. So, we can subtract the amount of gravel Gissela and Gordy's trucks can carry from the total to find out how much Gary's truck can carry. 

11,600 - (4,000 + 4,800) = 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel."
"To find out how many dumplings Larry cooked, we need to first find out how many dumplings the females ate. Since there are 6 females and each female ate 3 dumplings, the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 x 3 = 18.

Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings. There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 x 4 = 32.

The total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females is 18 + 32 = 50. Since there were no leftovers, Larry must have cooked 50 dumplings."
"To find out how much money Gerald had left, we need to first find out how much money he had initially. Since Gerald and Julia divided $100 in the ratio 3:2, we can calculate the amount of money Gerald got by finding 3/5 of $100.

$4200 / $2100 (hourly amount) = 2

So, they need to fundraise for 2 more hours to reach their goal."
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes. 

The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. 

So, the percentage of water used for industrial purposes is 40% * 80% = 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 or 32%.

Now, to find the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from 100%.

"To find out how much candy Amy has after two weeks, we need to calculate how much candy she eats in two weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so two weeks is 14 days. 

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces of candy.

Amy started with 100 pieces of candy, so after eating 42 pieces, she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces of candy left.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces of candy.

Ginger started with 100 pieces of candy, so after eating 56 pieces, she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces of candy left.

Amy has 58 pieces of candy left, and Ginger has 44 pieces of candy left. 

Amy has 58 - 44 = 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger."
"To find the number of tiles needed, we need to calculate two thirds of 36 square feet. 

Two thirds of 36 is 24.

"To find the total calories in the omelet, we need to calculate the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham.

First, let's calculate the calories from the eggs: 
6 eggs * 75 calories per egg = 450 calories

Next, let's calculate the calories from the cheese: 
2 oz of cheese * 120 calories per oz = 240 calories

Now, let's calculate the calories from the ham: 
2 oz of ham * 40 calories per oz = 80 calories

Now, let's add up the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham: 
450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories

The omelet has 770 calories."
"To find the total cost of the pencils, multiply the cost of one pencil by the number of pencils: 
6 pencils * $0.50 = $3

To find the total cost of the erasers, multiply the cost of one eraser by the number of erasers: 
8 erasers * $0.25 = $2

Now, add the cost of the pencils and erasers: 
$3 + $2 = $5

You paid $10, so subtract the total cost from the amount you paid: 
$10 - $5 = $5

You would get $5 in change."
"To find out how many people accept the position, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we need to find out how many people receive interviews. 
   100 people apply, and 30% receive interviews. 
   30% of 100 is 0.3 * 100 = 30 people.

2. Then, we need to find out how many people receive a job offer. 
   30 people receive interviews, and 20% receive a job offer. 
   20% of 30 is 0.2 * 30 = 6 people.

3. Finally, we need to find out how many people accept the position. 
   6 people receive a job offer, and a third of them accept the position. 
   A third of 6 is 6 / 3 = 2 people.

So, 2 people accept the position.

8 - 4 = 4

Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week."
"Helga taps her right foot 300 times per minute, and her left foot 250 times per minute. When her arms are raised, her tap rate is 200 times per minute for each foot. 

In the 2 minutes when her arms are raised, she taps her right foot 2 * 200 = 400 times and her left foot 2 * 200 = 400 times. 

In the 3 minutes when her arms are not raised, she taps her right foot 3 * 300 = 900 times and her left foot 3 * 250 = 750 times. 

So, the total number of times Helga taps her right foot is 400 + 900 = 1300 times. The total number of times Helga taps her left foot is 400 + 750 = 1150 times. 

The combined total number of times that Helga taps both of her feet is 1300 + 1150 = 2450 times.

"To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the potential damage to his car.

The city council will fine Ron $120 for fixing the pothole himself, and he has to buy 3 buckets of asphalt that each cost $25. So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is:

$120 (fine) + $75 (3 buckets of asphalt) = $195

The potential damage to his car is $450. 

To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we subtract the total cost of fixing the pothole from the potential damage to his car:

$450 (potential damage) - $195 (total cost) = $255

So, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself.

"To find out how many slices were left, we need to calculate the total number of slices first. Since there are 5 people and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 x 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x 2/3 = 4/3 of the total pizza. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 4/3 by 60. 4/3 x 60 = 80 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x ¾ = 1 ½ of the total pizza. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 1 ½ by 60. 1 ½ x 60 = 90 slices.

Now, we need to subtract the slices eaten by all 5 friends from the total number of slices. 60 - 80 - 90 = -30. However, since we can't have negative slices, we need to recheck our calculations.

Let's recheck the calculations. Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x 2/3 = 4/3 of the total pizza. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 4/3 by 60. 4/3 x 60 = 80 slices.

"To find the time the dog takes to eat the sausages, we need to calculate 2/3 of the time the cat takes. 

The cat takes 30 minutes, so 2/3 of 30 minutes is 20 minutes. 

Now, we have the time the cat takes (30 minutes) and the time the dog takes (20 minutes). 

To find the average time, we add the two times together and divide by 2. 

(30 + 20) / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25 minutes.

The average time the cat and dog take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes.

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe to inches first. 

One foot is equal to 12 inches. So, 8 feet is equal to 8 * 12 = 96 inches. Adding the extra 4 inches, we get 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's say the length of one of Bobby's shoes is x. Then, the length of Topher's shoe is 9x + 10.

We know that the length of Topher's shoe is 100 inches. So, we can set up the equation: 9x + 10 = 100.

Now, we need to solve for x. Subtract 10 from both sides: 9x = 90. Divide both sides by 9: x = 10.

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."
"To find the total number of windows smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for students' cars and teachers' cars separately.

1. First, find the number of people who voted by midday. 
   2/5 of 5000 people voted by midday. 
   2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people voted by midday.

2. Now, find the number of people remaining after midday. 
   Total people - people who voted by midday = 5000 - 2000 = 3000 people remaining.

3. Next, find the number of people who voted by 16:00.

"To find out how many packs Parker needs, we need to divide the total number of days he wants the gum to last by the number of days he chews per pack. 

Since he chews 4 pieces a day, and a pack has 15 pieces, we can divide 30 days by 4 pieces per day to get the total number of packs he needs. 

30 days / 4 pieces per day = 7.5 packs

Since you can't buy half a pack, we round up to the nearest whole number. 

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."

Now, add the number of smores the kids and adults will eat: 18 smores + 6 smores = 24 smores.

Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, divide the total number of smores needed by 8: 24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, you will need 3 boxes of graham crackers."
"To find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to first find their individual ages.

Dora is 15 years old.

Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 
So, Dora's father's age = 2 * 15 + 8 = 38 years.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. 
So, Dora's mother's age = 38 - 4 = 34 years.

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.
Total combined age = Dora's age + Dora's father's age + Dora's mother's age

54 students / 12 groups = 4.5 students per group.

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. 
So, we need 5 students per group.

Now, we need to find the total number of groups needed for 54 students. 
54 students / 5 students per group = 10.8 groups.

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. 
So, we need 11 groups.

To find the number of groups needed to form, we subtract the number of groups we already have from the total number of groups required. 
11 groups - 12 groups = -1 group.

However, we can't have a negative number of groups. This means we need to re-evaluate the question.

"To find the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends separately and then add them together.

There are 5 weekdays in a week, and 2 weeks in a month. So, in a month, there are 5 * 2 = 10 weekdays. 
There are 7 days in a week, and 2 weeks in a month. So, in a month, there are 7 * 2 = 14 weekend days.

During weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day. So, in a month, 60 * 10 = 600 chairs are rented.
During weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day. So, in a month, 100 * 14 = 1400 chairs are rented.

Total chairs rented in a month = 600 + 1400 = 2000 chairs.

$140 - $7 = $133.

So, you will pay $133 after the discount."
"To find the total number of hours the playlists will last, we need to multiply the number of playlists by the number of songs in each playlist and then multiply that by the length of each song.

First, we multiply the number of playlists by the number of songs in each playlist: 
20 playlists * 300 songs = 6000 songs

Then, we multiply the total number of songs by the length of each song: 
6000 songs * 10 hours = 60,000 hours

The 20 playlists will last for 60,000 hours in total."
"To find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we need to first find out how many people think horse #2 will win and how many people think horse #7 will win.

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. 
20% of 50 is 0.2 x 50 = 10 people.

60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. 
There are 50 - 10 = 40 people remaining. 
60% of 40 is 0.6 x 40 = 24 people.

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. 
There are 50 - 10 - 24 = 16 people.

So, 16 people think horse #12 will win.

"To find the total number of Pomeranians, we know that one third of them are girls and there are 6 girls. So, if 1/3 of the Pomeranians are girls, then the total number of Pomeranians is 6 * 3 = 18.

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. If there are 18 Pomeranians, then the total number of puppies is 18 * 3/2 = 27.

The final answer is 27."
"Jayden had $70. His sister Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $90 / 2 = $45. Now Jayden has $70 + $45 = $115. The camera costs $200, so Jayden needs $200 - $115 = $85 more.

"To find out how many cases of shingles the third house needs, we need to first figure out how many cases the first house needs. 

The first house needs half of the total, which is 1/2 * 250 = 125 cases.

The third house needs double the first house, so it needs 2 * 125 = 250 cases.

The answer is 250."
"To find out how much they spent, we need to add up the cost of the cucumbers, tomatoes, and lettuce.

Leila bought 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so she spent 3 x $2 = $6.
Jack bought 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so he spent 5 x $1 = $5.
Chase bought 1 head of lettuce at $3.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $6 + $5 + $3 = $14.

The three of them spent $14 to make a salad for the potluck."
"To find out how many fruits George has, we need to first find out how many pears he has. Since George has 45% more pears than bananas, we can calculate the number of pears by multiplying the number of bananas by 1.45 (which is 100% + 45%). 

Number of pears = 200 * 1.45 = 290

Now, we add the number of bananas and pears to find the total number of fruits. 

Total number of fruits = 200 (bananas) + 290 (pears) = 490

The final answer is 490."
"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to subtract the cost of the ball from the amount of money she had. 

First, we subtract the cost of the ball ($20) from the total money she had ($80). 

$80 - $20 = $60

Now, we need to divide the remaining money ($60) by the cost of each candy bar ($5) to find out how many candy bars she bought.

$60 ÷ $5 = 12

So, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy."
"To make 1 liter of juice, Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges. So, to make 4 liters of juice, he needs 4 times 5 kilograms, which is 20 kilograms of oranges. 

Each kilogram of oranges costs $3. So, 20 kilograms of oranges will cost 20 times $3, which is $60.

"To find out how many books Ahmed read, we need to know how many books Ezra read in total. 

Ezra read 300 books initially and then decided to read 150 more. So, Ezra read 300 + 150 = 450 books in total.

Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can divide the total number of books Ezra read by 2 to find out how many books Ahmed read. 

450 / 2 = 225

So, Ahmed read 225 books.

Now, we need to add the number of books Ezra and Ahmed read to find the total number of books they read altogether. 

300 (Ezra) + 225 (Ahmed) = 525

The final answer is: 525"
"To find out how much Tanya earned, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. She earns $15 per hour, so for 5 hours, she earns 5 x $15 = $75. Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she also earns an additional $5 per day, so she earns $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. She earns $15 per hour, so for 2 hours, she earns 2 x $15 = $30. Since she teaches 2 classes, she earns an additional $5 per day, so she earns $30 + $5 = $35.

To find the total amount Tanya earned, we add the earnings from Monday and Wednesday: $80 + $35 = $115.

"To find out how many more vanilla scents sold compared to fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

Vanilla scents sold: 5 scents per type * 4 types = 20 scents
Fruity scents sold: 2 scents per type * 8 types = 16 scents

Now, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold to find the difference:
20 - 16 = 4

So, 4 more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents.

"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we need to first calculate how much money he made from selling eggplants. 

Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so he made 20 x 3 = $60 from eggplants.

Now, we need to subtract the money he made from eggplants from the total amount he wants to make. 
$135 - $60 = $75

This is the amount of money Bennet needs to make from selling corn. He has 25 ears of corn, so we need to divide $75 by 25 to find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for.

$75 ÷ 25 = $3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

"To find the time Tatiana spends playing soccer, we first need to find the total time she has available. She has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, so she has 7 + 5 = 12 hours.

She reads for 3 hours, so the remaining time is 12 - 3 = 9 hours. 

She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time, which is 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours. 

So, the time she spends playing soccer is 12 - 3 - 3 = 6 hours.

To find the percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time and multiply by 100. 

(6 / 12) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps:

1. Anthony started with 50 pencils.
2. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, so he gave 50 * 1/2 = 25 pencils to Brandon.
3. Now, he has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.
4. He gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie, so he gave 25 * 3/5 = 15 pencils to Charlie.
5. Now, he has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Anthony kept 10 pencils.

"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes to drive to the museum and back.

Time to drive to the museum = Distance / Speed
Time to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time to drive to the museum = 2 hours

Since Jack spends 6 hours at the museum, we need to add the time it takes to drive to the museum and the time spent at the museum.

Total time = Time to drive to the museum + Time spent at the museum
Total time = 2 hours + 6 hours
Total time = 8 hours

So, Jack is gone from home for 8 hours."
"To find out how many wheels Henry will need, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles.

For the cars, Henry needs 57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels.
For the motorcycles, Henry needs 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels.

Total wheels needed = 228 wheels for cars + 146 wheels for motorcycles = 374 wheels.

Henry has 650 wheels in the box. To find out how many wheels will be left, we subtract the total wheels needed from the total wheels available:

650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels.

The answer is: 276"
"To find the discount amount, I need to calculate 20% of the original price. 

20% of $1000 is 0.20 * 1000 = $200.

Now, I need to subtract the discount from the original price. 

$1000 - $200 = $800.

So, you have to pay $800."
"To find the cost of replacing the movies, we need to break it down into parts.

First, let's find out how many movies are in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate that as:

600 / 3 = 200 movies in series

Now, we know that these 200 movies can be bought for $6 each, so the cost for these movies is:

200 * 6 = $1200

Next, we need to find out how many remaining movies are not in series. Since 200 movies are in series, we subtract that from the total:

600 - 200 = 400 movies

Now, we know that 40% of the remaining 400 movies are older movies, so we can calculate the number of older movies as:

400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies

These older movies cost $5 each, so the cost for these movies is:

160 * 5 = $800

Now, we need to find the cost of the remaining movies that are not older. Since we already know the cost of the older movies, we can subtract that from the total cost of the remaining movies:

$1200 + $800 = $2000

The remaining movies are not in series and are not older, so they must be the newer movies. Since there are 400 remaining movies and 160 are older, we can calculate the number of newer movies as:

400 - 160 = 240 newer movies

The cost of these newer movies is:

240 * 10 = $2400

Now, we can add up the cost of all the movies:

$1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400

The total cost of replacing the movies is $4400."
"To find out how much Winston spent on fruit, I need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

Peaches cost $2.00 per pound, and Winston picked 6 pounds, so the cost of peaches is 6 x $2.00 = $12.00.
Plums cost $1.00 per pound, and Winston picked 8 pounds, so the cost of plums is 8 x $1.00 = $8.00.
Apricots cost $3.00 per pound, and Winston picked 6 pounds, so the cost of apricots is 6 x $3.00 = $18.00.

Now, I need to add the costs of all the fruits together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00.

Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to first find the speed at which they hiked. 

They drove at 50 miles per hour. They hiked 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of 50 is 25. 25 - 5 is 20. So they hiked at 20 miles per hour.

They drove for 6 hours and hiked for 1.5 hours. The distance they drove is 50 * 6 = 300 miles. The distance they hiked is 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

The total distance to their vacation spot is 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the points each of them got.

Let's assume Emma's score is E and Ava's score is A.

Emma collects 3 more berries than Ava, so Emma collects 3 * 5 = 15 berries. Ava collects 15 - 3 = 12 berries.

Emma jumps on fewer enemies than Ava, so Emma jumps on 8 - 8 = 0 enemies. Ava jumps on 8 more enemies, so Ava jumps on 8 enemies.

Emma finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, so Emma finishes the level in 60 - 4 = 56 seconds. Ava finishes the level in 56 + 4 = 60 seconds.

Emma's score is 0 * 10 + 15 * 5 + 56 * 30 = 0 + 75 + 1680 = 1755.

Ava's score is 8 * 10 + 12 * 5 + 60 * 30 = 80 + 60 + 1800 = 1940.

The difference between their scores is 1940 - 1755 = 185.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. 

After the sales assistant took 17 fish from the pet store, Bob had 3 + x orange fish and 4 - y white fish.

Since he ended up with twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation: 
3 + x = 2(4 - y)

We also know that the total number of fish Bob had after adding the new ones is 7 + 17 = 24. So, 
3 + x + 4 - y = 24

Now we have two equations:
3 + x = 2(4 - y)
3 + x + 4 - y = 24

We can simplify the first equation to:
3 + x = 8 - 2y
x = 5 - 2y

Now, substitute x in the second equation:
3 + (5 - 2y) + 4 - y = 24
12 - 3y = 24
-3y = 12
y = -4

Since we can't have a negative number of fish, this solution doesn't make sense. However, let's re-evaluate the equations.

"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in a week and then multiply it by his fuel efficiency.

Since Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance is 5 miles, so the round trip is 10 miles. 

So, the total miles driven per week is 5 days * 10 miles/day = 50 miles.

Now, we need to find out how many gallons of gas he uses per week. We know his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, so we divide the total miles driven by his fuel efficiency:

50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons

Now, we multiply the gallons used by the price of gas to find the total cost:

5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15

The answer is 15."
"To find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch, we need to calculate the amount she spent from the quarters and the twenties.

Carrie was given 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. 
3/5 of 10 is 6. 
She spent 6 twenties, so she has 10 - 6 = 4 twenties left.

Carrie was given 140 quarters. She spent all of them. 
Since 1 twenty is equal to 4 quarters, 140 quarters is equal to 140 / 4 = 35 twenties.

Now, we add the amount she spent from the twenties and the amount she spent from the quarters. 
She spent 6 twenties and 35 twenties, so the total amount she spent is 6 + 35 = 41 twenties.

Since 1 twenty is equal to 20 dollars, 41 twenties is equal to 41 * 20 = 820 dollars.

The total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch is 820 dollars."
"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then add them together.

Tomatoes: 5 plants * 22 tomatoes/plant = 110 tomatoes
Eggplants: 8 plants * 4 eggplants/plant = 32 eggplants

Total fruits = 110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits

"To find out how many OLED TVs Samwell sold, we need to first find out how many non-OLED TVs were sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, so that's 1/4 * 40 = 10 smart TVs. 
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, so that's 1/8 * 40 = 5 analog TVs. 
The rest are OLED TVs. We can find the number of OLED TVs by subtracting the number of smart and analog TVs from the total number of TVs. 
40 - 10 - 5 = 25 

So, Samwell sold 25 OLED TVs.

"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to first find out how much the school will cover. Since the school is covering half the cost, we need to divide the total cost by 2.

$300 / 2 = $150

The school will cover $150. Now, we need to subtract the amount John has from the amount the school will cover to find out how much he is missing.

$150 - $50 = $100

John is missing $100."
"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we need to calculate the difference in temperature between the day and night. 

The temperature during the day is 45 degrees, and it's 33 degrees colder at night, so the temperature at night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since the pipes will freeze at 32 degrees, and it's 12 degrees colder at night, Carson needs to heat the house up from 12 to 32 degrees. 

To do this, he needs to heat 32 - 12 = 20 degrees. Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, he needs 20 / 5 = 4 logs."
"To find the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of people by the number of people in each group. 

90 people / 9 people per group = 10 groups

Since 3/5 of the groups had members bring back seashells, we need to find 3/5 of the total number of groups.

3/5 * 10 groups = 6 groups

Each group had 2 seashells, so we multiply the number of groups by the number of seashells each group had.

6 groups * 2 seashells per group = 12 seashells

The answer is 12."
"To find out how many people are on the train, we need to subtract the people who got off at the first stop and add the people who got on at the first stop, then subtract the people who got off at the second stop.

There were 172 people initially. 
47 people got off at the first stop, so we subtract 47 from 172: 172 - 47 = 125.
13 people got on at the first stop, so we add 13 to 125: 125 + 13 = 138.
38 people got off at the second stop, so we subtract 38 from 138: 138 - 38 = 100.

There are 100 people on the train now.

"To find out how much Jamie was paid, we need to calculate her earnings for the regular 8 hours and the additional hours she worked.

First, let's calculate her earnings for the regular 8 hours:
8 hours * $20/hour = $160

Then, we need to calculate her earnings for the additional 3 hours (11 hours - 8 hours):
3 hours * $20/hour = $60

Now, we need to calculate her special hourly rate, which is 150% of her regular hourly rate:
150% of $20/hour = 1.5 * $20/hour = $30/hour

Now, we can calculate her earnings for the additional 3 hours at the special rate:
3 hours * $30/hour = $90

Now, we add her earnings for the regular hours and the special hours:
$160 + $90 = $250

So, Jamie was paid $250 for her work that day."
"To find the total number of lions, we need to add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs. 

First, we know there are 12 female lions. Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, we can calculate the number of male lions by dividing the number of female lions by 2. 

12 / 2 = 6

Now, we add the number of male lions to the number of female lions and lion cubs. 

12 (female lions) + 6 (male lions) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32

There are 32 lions in the enclosure."
"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to first calculate the discount on the jeans. 

The original price of the jeans is $40. The discount is 25%. 

Discount = 25% of $40 = 0.25 * $40 = $10

Now, subtract the discount from the original price to get the sale price.

Sale price = Original price - Discount
= $40 - $10
= $30

Now, Mike pays with a $50 bill. To find out how much money he will have left over, we subtract the sale price from the $50 bill.

Money left over = $50 - $30
= $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to calculate the total number of employees and then multiply it by the salary of each employee.

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. After three months, the total number of employees will be:
200 (initial employees) + 20 (new employees in month 1) + 20 (new employees in month 2) + 20 (new employees in month 3) = 260 employees

Since each employee is paid $4000 per month, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:
260 employees * $4000 per employee = $1,040,000

The final answer is: $1,040,000"
"To find the total time they will be caroling, we need to add the time for each song. 

""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long, and they will sing it twice, so that's 2 x 150 = 300 seconds. 
Then, they will sing ""Jingle Bells"" which is 240 seconds long. 
So, the total time is 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.

"To find out how much Billy earns, we need to calculate his hourly wage after the two raises. 

Billy's initial wage was $10 per hour. After the first raise, his wage became $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After the second raise, his wage became $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Now, we need to calculate how much Billy earns in 20 hours. 
$11.50 per hour * 20 hours = $230.

Sally's starting wage is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage, so her starting wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. 
Sally's wage is also $0.50 more than Billy's wage, so her wage is $11.50 + $0.50 = $12.00 per hour.

Now, we need to calculate how much Sally earns in 20 hours. 
$12.00 per hour * 20 hours = $240.

To find out how much more money Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings. 
$230 - $240 = -$10.

The answer is -10."

Now, we subtract the cost of 2 bagels from the cost of 3 loaves of bread: $6 - $2 = $4

So, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels."
"To find out how many points Nikita scored, we need to calculate half of Pierson's score and add 11 to it. 

Half of Pierson's score is 278 / 2 = 139. 
Nikita scored 11 more than that, so Nikita scored 139 + 11 = 150.

Now, we need to add Pierson's score to Nikita's score to get the total. 
278 (Pierson's score) + 150 (Nikita's score) = 428.

The total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is 428."
"To find the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students. There are 40 classes with 25 students in each class. So, the total number of students is 40 * 25 = 1000 students.

Each student plants one tree, so the total number of trees planted by the students is 1000.

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers. There are 40 classes with 3 teachers in each class. So, the total number of teachers is 40 * 3 = 120 teachers.

Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by the teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

Now, we add the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers to get the total number of trees planted. 1000 + 240 = 1240.

The total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign is 1240.

Now, we need to find 30% of 14. 
30% of 14 is 0.3 * 14 = 4.2

Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. 
So, Bubbles should buy 5 stuffed goats."
"To find out how many hours Kris has played, we need to calculate the total hours she played in the first 2 weeks. 

In 2 weeks, there are 14 days. If Kris plays half an hour every day, she played 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours.

Then, she plays 2 hours every day for a week, which is 7 days. So, she played 7 * 2 = 14 hours.

In total, Kris played 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs 30 hours. So, she still needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the distance each car travels in 2 hours. 

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel 60 * 2 = 120 miles.

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel 70 * 2 = 140 miles.

Since the second car passed the first car, we need to find the distance between them. To do that, we subtract the distance traveled by the first car from the distance traveled by the second car: 140 - 120 = 20 miles.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the ring first. The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300. So, the total cost of the ring is $600 + $300 = $900.

Then, we need to add the 30% premium. To do this, we multiply the total cost by 0.3 (which is 30% in decimal form). 

$900 * 0.3 = $270

Now, we add the premium to the total cost. 

$900 + $270 = $1170

So, James paid $1170 for the ring."
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

Third-graders passed: 340
Fourth-graders passed: 40
Fifth-graders passed: 40 * 2 = 80 (since their pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders)

Total students passed: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460
Total students: 500 + 100 + 400 = 900

Now, we can calculate the overall pass rate:
Overall pass rate = (Total students passed / Total students) * 100
= (460 / 900) * 100
= 0.5111 * 100
= 51.11%

The school's overall pass rate is 51.11%."
"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to first find out how many square inches of mosaic he can make with two bags of glass chips. 

Since each bag holds 72 chips and it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, we divide 72 by 12 to find out how many square inches he can make with one bag. 

72 / 12 = 6 square inches per bag

Since Milo has two bags, we multiply the number of square inches per bag by 2. 

6 * 2 = 12 square inches

Now, we know that it takes 12 chips to make one square inch. Since Milo has 12 square inches of mosaic, we divide 12 by 12 to find out how many inches long his mosaic can be.

12 / 12 = 1 inch

So, Milo can make his mosaic 1 inch long.

"To find out how many quarts of tea were at the beginning of the party, we need to add the quarts of tea that the students drank and add that to the quarts of tea left.

First, let's calculate the total quarts of tea the students drank. 
Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.
16 students drank 2 quarts each, so 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.
Total quarts of tea the students drank is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Now, we add the quarts of tea left to the total quarts of tea the students drank. 
10 quarts (left) + 38 quarts (drunk) = 48 quarts.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts, we need to divide the total quarts by 4 to find out how many gallons were at the beginning of the party.
48 quarts / 4 = 12 gallons.

He made $105 in a week, and he charges $.25 per branch. 

$105 / $.25 = 420 branches

Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total branches by 7 to find the average branches per day.

420 branches / 7 days = 60 branches per day.

The final answer is 60."
"To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for the first type of flowers: 3 flowers with 5 petals each. 
3 * 5 = 15 petals

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals for the second type of flowers: 4 flowers with 6 petals each. 
4 * 6 = 24 petals

Then, let's calculate the total number of petals for the third type of flowers: 5 flowers with 4 petals each. 
5 * 4 = 20 petals

Lastly, let's calculate the total number of petals for the fourth type of flowers: 6 flowers with 7 petals each. 
6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add the total number of petals for all types of flowers together: 
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 of each type of flower, we need to subtract 1 for each type of flower. 
There are 3 types of flowers, so we subtract 3 from the total number of petals: 
101 - 3 = 98 petals

The final answer is: 98"
"To find out how many marshmallows are left, we need to subtract the number of marshmallows dropped from the total number of marshmallows. 

First, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows used:

Now, subtract the number of marshmallows dropped (3) from the total number of marshmallows (35): 
35 - 3 = 32

Now, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 since each S'more uses 2 marshmallows. 
32 / 2 = 16

So, John and DeSean can each have 8 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

"So, Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter. His friends can play for half that time, which is 10 minutes. The better friend can play for 1.5 times that, which is 15 minutes. 

If they play for 4 hours, that's 240 minutes. 

Jack plays for 20 minutes, his friend plays for 10 minutes, and the other friend plays for 15 minutes. That's 45 minutes. 

So, 240 - 45 = 195 minutes left. 

Jack can play for 20 minutes, so he can play 195 / 20 = 9.75 times. 

Since each game costs 1 quarter, that's 9.75 quarters. 

9.75 quarters is 9.75 * 25 cents = 244.25 cents. 

244.25 cents is 2.4425 dollars."
"To find out how many ounces of oil Tanya uses, we need to first find out how many ounces of each ingredient she uses. 

Let's say the amount of salt is x. Since she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, the amount of sugar is also x. 

Since she uses twice as much oil as salt, the amount of oil is 2x. 

Since she uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, and the amount of salt is x, the amount of citrus zest is also x.

Now, we know that the total amount of ingredients is 10 ounces. So, we can write the equation:

x + x + 2x + x + x = 10

Combine like terms:

6x = 10

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 10/6
x = 5/3

Now that we know x, we can find the amount of oil:

Oil = 2x
Oil = 2 * (5/3)
Oil = 10/3

To convert this to a decimal, we can divide 10 by 3:

Oil = 3.33

So, Tanya uses 3.33 ounces of oil."

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars he sells, we need to calculate 20% of 40. 20% is the same as 0.2, so we multiply 40 by 0.2: 40 * 0.2 = 8 cars.

Now, Joe has 40 - 8 = 32 cars left.

Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. He sold 8 cars, so he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

Now, Joe has 32 - 16 = 16 cars left.

The final answer is 16."

88 tins (cat food) - 36 tins (dog food) = 52 tins

Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Let's say PJ has x cards. 
Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. 
Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341. 
So, we can write the equation: x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms: 7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7: x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out how many cards Becca has: 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153

Becca has 153 cards.

"To find out how many eggs Cindy had altogether, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs she had.

She had 5 green eggs. 
She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 5 x 2 = 10 blue eggs.
She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs of each color: 
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

"To find out how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book and then subtract the refund amount from the original purchase price.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost:
Weight: 4 pounds
Shipping cost per pound: $0.35
Shipping cost: 4 * $0.35 = $1.40
Distance: 20 miles
Shipping cost per mile: $0.08
Shipping cost: 20 * $0.08 = $1.60
Total shipping cost: $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Now, let's calculate the refund amount:
Original purchase price: $32
Refund percentage: 75%
Refund amount: $32 * 0.75 = $24

Now, let's calculate the total amount Milly will lose:
Total cost: $32 (original purchase price) + $3 (shipping cost) = $35
Refund amount: $24
Amount Milly will lose: $35 - $24 = $11

The final answer is: $11"
"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to subtract the cost of the jeans and the bag from the total amount of money she had.

Mulan started with $40 and her father gave her $100. So, she had $40 + $100 = $140.

She bought two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so the total cost of the jeans is $30 * 2 = $60.

She also bought a bag for $20.

Now, let's subtract the cost of the jeans and the bag from the total amount of money she had: $140 - $60 - $20 = $60.

Mulan has $60 left."
"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for each week.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find the production for the fourth week, we need to know how much he produced in the first three weeks. 

8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since we don't have information about the production in the fourth week, we can't calculate it directly."
"To find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the total time she spends on TikTok per week and then multiply it by 4.

She records 18 videos per week, so that's 18 * 4 = 72 minutes per week.

She spends 2 hours (120 minutes) per week writing songs, and 15 minutes per day (6 days a week) doing her makeup, so that's 15 * 6 = 90 minutes per week.

Total time spent on TikTok per week is 72 + 90 = 162 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 162 minutes is equal to 162 / 60 = 2.7 hours per week.

Now, multiply the time spent on TikTok per week by 4 to get the time spent in a month: 2.7 * 4 = 10.8 hours.

The final answer is: 10.8"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the standard items and the additional items.

The standard items are 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier. The cost of these items is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, so she needs 2 additional mirrors. The cost of the additional mirrors is 2 x $15.00 = $30.00.

Angela has 2 chandeliers, so she needs 4 additional chandeliers. The cost of the additional chandeliers is 4 x $15.00 = $60.00.

Angela has 20 pictures, so she needs 16 additional pictures. The cost of the additional pictures is 16 x $15.00 = $240.00.

The total cost of the standard items is $129.00. The total cost of the additional items is $30.00 + $60.00 + $240.00 = $330.00.

The total cost is $129.00 + $330.00 = $459.00.

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to start with Eva's savings. 

Eva has saved $20.00. 
Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00. 
Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, so we need to calculate 40% of $30.00. 
40% of $30.00 is 0.4 * $30.00 = $12.00. 
Now, we add this 40% to Anthony's savings: $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00. 

Roy has $42.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how high Saskay can lift a mountain. 

Since Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, and Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, Saskay can lift 12 inches.

Now, we know that Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. Since Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, Naruto can lift 10 * 4 = 40 times higher than Saskay.

So, Naruto can lift 12 * 40 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12. 480 / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in the first 4 hours and the distance he traveled in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance in the first 4 hours + Distance in the next 6 hours
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles
Total distance = 80 miles

The total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles."
"To solve this problem, we first need to find the speed of the kangaroo. Since 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can divide the total time by the number of kangaroos to find the time it would take for one kangaroo to travel across the highway. 

Time for one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos = 6 hours

Now, we know that each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo. So, the speed of a turtle is 1/2 of the speed of a kangaroo. 

Speed of a turtle = 1/2 * speed of a kangaroo

Since we don't know the exact speed of a kangaroo, we can represent it as 'x'. Then, the speed of a turtle is x/2.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

We know that the distance is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles, so we can set up the equation:

Time for one kangaroo = Time for one turtle
6 hours = (Distance / x) / (x/2)

Simplifying the equation, we get:
6 hours = 2 * (Distance / x)
6 hours = 2D / x
6x = 2D
3x = D

Now, we can substitute the value of D in the equation for the time it takes for one turtle to travel across the highway:
Time for one turtle = D / (x/2)
Time for one turtle = 3x / (x/2)
Time for one turtle = 3x * 2 / x
Time for one turtle = 6 hours

Since there are four turtles, the total time it will take for four turtles to travel across the highway is:
Total time = 4 * Time for one turtle
Total time = 4 * 6 hours
Total time = 24 hours

The final answer is: 24"
"So, Kora made 20 clay dishes. Rory makes 20 more than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 clay dishes. Jada makes twice as many as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 clay dishes. 

To find the total number of clay dishes they all made together, we need to add the number of dishes each of them made. 20 + 40 + 80 = 140."
"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop and receiving the help from her mom.

First, let's calculate the price of the laptop after trading in her old one: 
$600 - $200 = $400

Now, let's add the money she already has in her purse, the money she got from her job, and the money her mom gave her:
Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as x.

We know that after all these, she only needs $50 more to buy the laptop. So, the equation would be:
x + 150 + 80 = 400 + 50

Combine the constants on the left side of the equation:
x + 230 = 450

Now, subtract 230 from both sides of the equation to solve for x:
x = 450 - 230
x = 220

So, Erika has $220 in her purse."
"To find out how many apple slices Adam has left, we need to calculate the total number of slices he had first. 

He had 3 large apples, and each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, so he had 3 x 5 = 15 slices from the large apples. 

He also had 5 small apples, and each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, so he had 5 x 3 = 15 slices from the small apples. 

In total, Adam had 15 + 15 = 30 slices. 

If he ate 15 slices, then he has 30 - 15 = 15 slices left."
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we need to divide 25 by 5 (the amount of milk one cow produces per day) and then multiply by 3 (the number of cows the farmer currently has).

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to find the length of each glue stick that is not used and add them together.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. 5/6 of 12 millimeters is 10 millimeters. 

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used. 1/3 of 12 millimeters is 4 millimeters.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used. 1/2 of 12 millimeters is 6 millimeters.

Now, let's add the lengths of the glue sticks that are not used: 10 millimeters + 4 millimeters + 6 millimeters = 20 millimeters.

"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to subtract the money he already has from the total cost of the items he wants to buy.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200. So, he has a total of $5000 + $200 = $5200.

The total cost of the items he wants to buy is $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10800.

To find out how much money he still needs, we subtract the money he has from the total cost: $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

Gabriel still needs $5600.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many socks Peter and Jack have. 

Since Jack collected 60 dishes and he has half times as many dishes as socks, we can find out how many socks Jack has by multiplying 60 by 2. 
60 * 2 = 120 socks

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can find out how many socks Peter has by multiplying 120 by 2.
120 * 2 = 240 socks

Now, we know that Jack has 60 dishes and Peter has twice as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 * 2 = 120 dishes.

To find the total number of socks and dishes, we add the number of socks and dishes together.
240 socks + 120 dishes = 360

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 360."
"To find the number of students good at both math and English, we need to subtract the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at English only from the total number of students.

First, let's find the number of students good at both subjects. 
Total students = 20
Students good at math only = 5
Students good at English only = 8

Students good at both = Total students - (Students good at math only + Students good at English only)
Students good at both = 20 - (5 + 8)
Students good at both = 20 - 13
Students good at both = 7

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the students good at math only and the students good at both subjects.
Students good at math = Students good at math only + Students good at both
Students good at math = 5 + 7
Students good at math = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many groups can perform, we need to calculate the total time taken by each group and subtract the time taken by the intermission.

Each group takes 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage. So, the total time taken by each group is 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes.

The total time of the concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. 

Now, subtract the time taken by the intermission (10 minutes) from the total time of the concert (120 minutes). 
120 - 10 = 110 minutes

Now, divide the remaining time by the time taken by each group (10 minutes). 
110 / 10 = 11

So, 11 groups can perform in the concert."
"To find the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest she earns each year and add it to the principal amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year.

For the first year, the interest earned is $225, so the total amount after 1 year is $300 + $225 = $525.

For the second year, the interest earned is 3/4 * $525 = $393.75, so the total amount after 2 years is $525 + $393.75 = $918.75.

For the third year, the interest earned is 3/4 * $918.75 = $693.5625, so the total amount after 3 years is $918.75 + $693.5625 = $1612.3125.

The total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $1612.3125."
"To find the number of white shirts with no collars, we need to know that half of the white shirts have collars. So, half of 40 is 20. That means 20 white shirts have collars. 

Now, to find the number of white shirts with no collars, we subtract 20 from 40. 40 - 20 = 20.

To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we know that 20 floral shirts have buttons. So, we subtract 20 from 50. 50 - 20 = 30.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars. 30 - 20 = 10.

The answer is 10."
"To find out how many trays the farmer can fill, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold. 

900 eggs / 30 eggs per tray = 30 trays

"To find out how much James pays for each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount he spends on shoes in a year by the number of pairs he buys in a year.

First, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes James buys in a year. Since he buys 2 pairs a month, and there are 12 months in a year, we multiply 2 pairs by 12 months.

2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

Now, we divide the total amount he spends on shoes in a year ($2640) by the number of pairs he buys in a year (24 pairs).

$2640 / 24 pairs = $110 per pair

The answer is 110."

"Let's break down the information given. 

Let's say my brother's age is B, my sister's age is S, and my age is A. 

From the information given, we have:
1. A = B - 3 (I am three years younger than my brother)
2. A = S + 2 (I am 2 years older than my sister)
3. 3B - 1 = A (My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age)
4. A + B + S = 87 (The sum of our ages is 87)

We can substitute the expressions for A from equations 1 and 2 into equation 4:
(B - 3) + B + (B - 3 - 2) = 87
Combine like terms:
3B - 8 = 87
Add 8 to both sides:
3B = 95
Divide by 3:
B = 31.67

Since age can't be a fraction, we'll round down to 31 (assuming ages are whole numbers).

Now we can find A and S:
A = B - 3 = 31 - 3 = 28
S = A - 2 = 28 - 2 = 26

So, I am 28 years old.

First, we find 10% of $20. 10% of $20 is 0.1 x $20 = $2. 

Since Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela, she received $20 - $2 = $18.

Now, we add the amount Rafaela received and the amount Julieta received. 
$20 + $18 = $38.

The total amount of money they received as tips is $38."

Jennifer has 3 oranges left."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 1 * 12 = 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge, so she earns 1/2 of a badge per month. In a year, she earns 1/2 * 12 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire, so she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to know how many silver coins she had. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation. 

Let's say the number of silver coins is x. Then the number of gold coins is x + 30. We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 70

To solve for x, we subtract 30 from both sides:

x = 70 - 30
x = 40

So Gretchen had 40 silver coins. To find the total number of coins, we add the number of silver coins and gold coins:

Total coins = 40 (silver) + 70 (gold)
Total coins = 110

"Let's break it down step by step. 

They have 12 red cars. 
They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so they have 12 - 2 = 10 green cars. 
They have 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so they have 3 * 10 = 30 blue cars. 
The total number of red, green, and blue cars is 12 + 10 + 30 = 52 cars. 
Since the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

We know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne. If we let the number of books Anne has be x, then Sofie has x + 25 books.

We also know that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn. So, if Fawn has y books, then Anne has y - 12 books.

Since Sofie and Anne together have 85 books, we can set up the equation: 
x + (x + 25) = 85

Combine like terms: 
2x + 25 = 85

Subtract 25 from both sides: 
2x = 60

Divide both sides by 2: 
x = 30

So, Anne has 30 books. Since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, Fawn has 30 + 12 = 42 books.

The seller gave $4000, so to find the change, subtract the total cost from the amount given: 
$4000 - $3500 = $500

The seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we need to first find out how much he spends in a month. 

Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, that means Keenan pays 40% of the cost. 

40% of $400 is 0.4 x $400 = $160. 

Now, we need to find out how much he spends per week. There are 4 weeks in a month, so we divide $160 by 4. 

$160 / 4 = $40.

The answer is 40."
"To find out how many pieces Tobias ate, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day.

First, let's find out how many pieces were left after the first day. He ate 2/5 of 60 pieces, which is (2/5) * 60 = 24 pieces. So, 60 - 24 = 36 pieces were left.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces. So, 36 - 10 = 26 pieces were left.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces. To find out how many pieces he ate, we need to multiply 7/13 by 26. (7/13) * 26 = 14. So, he ate 14 pieces on the third day.

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate each day: 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces.

The final answer is 48."
"To find the total cost, I need to calculate the cost of the soda and the cost of the water separately. 

The cost of 3 bottles of soda is 3 x $21.00 = $63.00.

"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points from each type of question and add them together.

For multiple-choice questions: 
There are 10 questions, and she answers 80% of them correctly. 
80% of 10 is 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions answered correctly. 
Since each question is worth 1 point, she scores 8 points from multiple-choice questions.

For true/false questions: 
There are 20 questions, and she answers 90% of them correctly. 
90% of 20 is 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions answered correctly. 
Since each question is worth 1 point, she scores 18 points from true/false questions.

For long-answer questions: 
There are 5 questions, and she answers 60% of them correctly. 
60% of 5 is 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions answered correctly. 
Since each question is worth 5 points, she scores 3 * 5 = 15 points from long-answer questions.

"To find out how much money Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000, we first need to know how much he plans to sell his chickens for. He has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them. 

3/5 of 300 chickens is 3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens. 

He plans to sell these 180 chickens at $50 each. So, he will make 180 * $50 = $9000. 

To make a profit of $2000, he needs to spend $9000 - $2000 = $7000. 

So, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for $7000."
"To find out how many glasses Micah sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 3, since there are 3 people. 

32 glasses / 3 people = 10.67 glasses per person

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, Micah also sold 10.67 glasses. 

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold.

14 glasses (Julie) - 10.67 glasses (Micah) = 3.33 glasses

"To find out how many years it will take for Melanie's age to be thrice her present age, we need to first find her present age. 

Since Melanie will be 18 in 10 years, her present age is 18 - 10 = 8 years.

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age. 

Thrice her present age is 3 * 8 = 24 years.

Since her present age is 8, we need to find out how many years it will take for her age to be 24. 

24 - 8 = 16 years.

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart.

First, let's calculate the cost of the bacon: 5 packs of bacon cost $10.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the chicken: 6 packets of chicken cost twice as much as a pack of bacon, so 6 * 2 = 12. The cost of the chicken is $10 * 2 = $20.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the strawberries: 3 packs of strawberries cost $4 each, so 3 * 4 = $12.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the apples: 7 packs of apples cost half the price of a pack of strawberries, so 7 * 2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $10 + $20 + $12 + $14 = $56.

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $56 = $9.

The total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To find the number of pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange, we first need to find out how many microphones were able to fit in the stage. 

If 20% of the microphones can't fit, that means 80% of the microphones can fit. 

80% of 50 microphones is 0.8 * 50 = 40 microphones.

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we divide the number of microphones that can fit by 2 to find the number of pairs.

40 / 2 = 20

The singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate each group separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of birds flying overhead. Since 2/3 of the birds are flying, we multiply the number of birds in the bushes by 2/3.

6 birds in the bushes * 2/3 = 4 birds flying overhead

Next, we need to find the total number of birds in the groups. There are 3 groups with 8 birds each, so we multiply 3 by 8.

3 * 8 = 24 birds in the groups

Now, we add the number of birds in the bushes, flying overhead, and in the groups to find the total number of birds.

6 (in the bushes) + 4 (flying overhead) + 24 (in the groups) = 34

The total number of birds Jerry counts is 34."
"To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to first find out how many cookies Lani had left after eating 5 cookies. 

She started with 55 cookies and ate 5, so she had 55 - 5 = 50 cookies left.

Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. So, the total number of petals from the orchids is 5 * 5 = 25.

Joelle has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. So, the total number of petals from the daisies is 4 * 10 = 40.

Now, we need to find the difference between the total number of petals from the daisies and the orchids. That would be 40 - 25 = 15.

The daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids."
"To find the number of indoor plants, we need to calculate one-fourth of 100. 
One-fourth of 100 is 25. So, there are 25 indoor plants.

Remaining plants = Total plants - Indoor plants
Remaining plants = 100 - 25
Remaining plants = 75

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. 
Two-thirds of 75 is 50. So, there are 50 outdoor plants.

Now, we need to find the number of flowering plants. 
Flowering plants = Remaining plants - Outdoor plants
Flowering plants = 75 - 50
Flowering plants = 25

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we need to divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100.
Percentage of flowering plants = (25 / 100) * 100
Percentage of flowering plants = 25%

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to know the speed of the thingamabob. Since a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, we can set up an equation. 

Let's say the speed of the thingamabob is x. Then, the speed of the whatchamacallit is 11x. We know the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, so we can set up the equation 11x = 121.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 11: x = 121 / 11 = 11.

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig. Since the whirligig spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob, we multiply the speed of the thingamabob by 5: 5 * 11 = 55.

The whirligig spins at 55 meters per second."
"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot, we need to first find out the total cost of the salad and yogurt. 

The salad costs $6, and the yogurt costs half of that, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

"So, Mark used to make $10 an hour, but now they raised his pay by $2 per hour. That means he now makes $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

He works 8 hours a day, and he works 5 days a week. So, he works 8 * 5 = 40 hours a week.

Now, to find out how much he makes a week, we multiply the number of hours he works in a week by his new hourly wage: 40 * $12 = $480.

The answer is 480."
"To find out how much Tasha made from mowing lawns, we need to first figure out how many times she mowed each lawn. 

Let's say she mowed Joe's lawn x times. Then, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times. 

Since Joe paid her $6 for his lawn, and she mowed his lawn x times, the total amount she earned from mowing Joe's lawn is 6x. 

The total amount she earned from mowing lawns is 6x + 15x + 25x = 46x. 

We know that the total amount she earned from mowing lawns is $80. So, 46x = 80. 

Dividing both sides by 46, we get x = 80/46 = 1.74 (approximately). 

Since we can't mow a lawn a fraction of a time, we'll round down to 1 time for Joe's lawn. 

So, she mowed Joe's lawn 1 time, Kamala's lawn 3 times, and Alba's lawn 5 times. 

The total amount she earned from mowing lawns is 6 + 15 + 25 = 46. 

The amount she made from lemonade sales is 80 - 46 = 34.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's say Adam's age four years ago was x. Then, Duncan's age eight years ago was 2x.

We know that Duncan's age now is 60, so we can set up an equation:

60 = 2x + 8 (since Duncan's age eight years ago was 60 - 8 = 52, and 52 = 2x)

Now, we can solve for x:

60 = 2x + 8
60 - 8 = 2x
52 = 2x
x = 26

So, Adam's age four years ago was 26. To find Adam's age now, we add 4 to 26:

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the yellow balloons. We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We also know that there were 20 red balloons.

Let's start by finding out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the red balloons. Since there were 20 red balloons and Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon, the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is 20 x 2 = 40.

Now, we know that Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna in total. We also know that 40 pieces of bologna were thrown at the red balloons. So, the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is 58 - 40 = 18.

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we can find the number of yellow balloons by dividing the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons by 3.

The cost of each lollipop is $0.5, and the selling price is $0.8. The profit per lollipop is $0.8 - $0.5 = $0.3.

The total profit from selling 300 lollipops is 300 * $0.3 = $90.

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Larry has 3 cats. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 x 3 = 9 dogs. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 x 7 = 21 fish. He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 1/3 x 21 = 7 gerbils.

Larry has 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47 pets."
"To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate how many slices each person eats per day. 

Abby eats 2 slices a day. Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices a day.

Now, let's add the slices they eat per day: 2 (Abby) + 4 (Josh) = 6 slices per day.

The loaf has 24 slices. To find out how many days it will last, we divide the total slices by the slices they eat per day: 24 / 6 = 4.

The loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"Martha has been collecting shells for 5 years. Since she collects one shell every month, she will have collected 5 shells per year. To find the total number of shells collected in 5 years, we multiply the number of shells collected per year by the number of years.

5 shells/year * 5 years = 25 shells

She will have 25 shells by her 10th birthday."
"To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we first need to find out how many cups of tea are in each row. 

Lana has 27 cups in total. She divides these into 3 rows. So, 27 cups / 3 rows = 9 cups per row.

Since she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row, that means there are 9 cups of each in each row. 

The remaining cups are for cinnamon tea, which is 15 cups. Since she has 9 cups in each row, she can only brew 1 row of cinnamon tea. 

So, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is 9."
"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we need to first find out how many trips he can make in 8 hours. 

Since it takes 4 hours for the sloth to make a round trip, he can make 8 / 4 = 2 trips in 8 hours.

Now, we need to find out how many berries he can pick in 2 trips. Let's say he picks x berries per trip. Then, in 2 trips, he picks 2x berries.

Since he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we can set up the equation: 2x = 24

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 12.

So, the sloth can pick 12 berries per trip.

"To find out how much water will be remaining in the tank, we need to first calculate how much water was put into the tank. The pool has 10000 gallons, and they filled the tank with half of that, so they put 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons into the tank.

The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. So, after 6 days, the tank will be emptied by 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons.

To find out how much water will be remaining in the tank, we subtract the amount emptied from the amount put into the tank: 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

"To find out how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying popcorn and candy.

Colby had 4 boxes of candy, so that's 4 * $2 = $8. He also had 2 tubs of popcorn, so that's 2 * $8 = $16. 

He spent $8 on popcorn and $2 on candy, so that's $8 + $2 = $10. 

He started with $150, so he has $150 - $10 = $140 left.

Tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10, and he wants to go to the movies on a Friday. So, he can buy 1 ticket for $10. 

He has $140 - $10 = $130 left. 

Now, he can buy as many tickets as he wants for other days, but we don't know how many days he has left. We know he saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, and 8 movies on other days. Since it's the last day of the month, he can't see any more movies on Fridays or Saturdays. 

So, he has 7 days left. He can buy 7 * $7 = $49 worth of tickets. 

He has $130 - $49 = $81 left. 

He can buy 81 / 7 = 11.57 tickets, but since you can't buy a fraction of a ticket, he can buy 11 tickets.

The final answer is 11."
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked:

200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked is 85,000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removed per day, we need to add up the total number of Junebugs she removed and divide it by the number of days.

She removed 39 Junebugs on Monday, 2 * 39 = 78 on Tuesday, 78 on Wednesday, 48 on Thursday, and 57 on Friday. 

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300

There are 5 days in total. 

Average Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days
= 300 / 5

"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus traveled 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so it traveled 60 x 5 = 300 miles.

The car traveled 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so it traveled 30 x 8 = 240 miles.

To find the difference, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled: 300 - 240 = 60 miles.

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to subtract the number of toys Sophie already had from the total number of toys she has now. 

First, let's add up the number of toys she already had: 
- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9
Total toys she already had: 31 + 8 + 9 = 48

Now, let's subtract the total number of toys she already had from the total number of toys she has now: 
Total toys now: 62
Toys she already had: 48
Bouncy balls in the tube: 62 - 48 = 14

The number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14."
"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given. Let's break it down step by step.

Let Peter's age be P, Paul's age be A, and Jean's age be J.

We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years, so we can write an equation:
P + A + J = 100

We also know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, so we can write another equation:
A = J + 10

We are also told that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age, so we can write another equation:
P = A + J

Now we have three equations and three variables. We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to get:
P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now we can substitute this expression for P into the first equation:
(2J + 10) + A + J = 100

We can simplify this equation by combining like terms:
3J + A + 10 = 100

Now we can substitute the second equation into this equation:
3J + (J + 10) + 10 = 100

Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80

Divide both sides by 4:
J = 20

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age:
A = J + 10
A = 20 + 10
A = 30

Now that we know Paul's age, we can find Peter's age:
P = A + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

The final answer is 50."
"So, Maria and her 4 friends started with 2 balloons each. That's 2 + 4 = 6 balloons. Then, her mom gave them 3 more balloons each. So, that's 3 + 6 = 9 more balloons. In total, they have 6 + 9 = 15 balloons."
"To find out how many boxes of stuff they have in total, we need to add the boxes donated by the people and the boxes they already own. 

10 people donated 5 boxes each, so that's 10 * 5 = 50 boxes. 
They already have 10 boxes, so in total they have 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we need to divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find out how many tables they need. 
60 / 2 = 30 tables.

They already have 15 tables, so they need 30 - 15 = 15 new tables."
"To find the total distance each person spat, we need to multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed was spat.

Zoey spat 40 seeds, each 10 feet, so she spat a total of 40 x 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney spat 35 seeds, each 12 feet, so she spat a total of 35 x 12 = 420 feet.

To find the average total distance spat, we need to add the total distances and divide by 2.

Average total distance spat = (400 + 420) / 2 = 820 / 2 = 410 feet.

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To find out how much money Fern will make from each machine, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine makes in a month.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour, so in 24 hours it makes 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets. In 30 days, it makes 1440 * 30 = 43,200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour, so in 24 hours it makes 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets. In 30 days, it makes 1080 * 30 = 32,400 widgets.

Since each widget sells for $6, the total money made from the Widgeteer 3000 is 43,200 * 6 = $259,200. The total money made from the WidgetMaster 9000 is 32,400 * 6 = $194,400.

To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000, we subtract the money made from the WidgetMaster 9000: $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800.

The final answer is: 64800"
"To find out how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of the 12-hour stay and the cost of the additional hours.

The 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos. 

Cameron stays for 5 hours after the 12-hour mark, so he needs to add 70 pesos for each of those hours. 5 hours * 70 pesos = 350 pesos.

The total cost for Cameron would be 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

The 24-hour stay costs 1600 pesos. 

Cameron would save 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

"To find out how much hay Nate needs, we need to calculate the amount of hay for each type of animal and then add them together.

Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Since there are 15 goats, the total amount of hay for goats is 15 * 5 = 75 pounds.

Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. So, each sheep needs 2 * 5 - 3 = 7 pounds of hay. Since there are 12 sheep, the total amount of hay for sheep is 12 * 7 = 84 pounds.

Now, we add the hay for goats and sheep together: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars

Now, subtract the money spent on gas and pencils:
300 dollars - 50 dollars (gas) - 50 dollars (pencils) = 200 dollars

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract that from his remaining money:
200 dollars - 100 dollars = 100 dollars

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to first find out how many bottles she gave to the students. 

There are 29 students and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58 bottles.

The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles she can get is 9 * 100 = 900 bottles.

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles she can get. 

900 - 58 = 842 bottles.

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the labor cost and add it to the parts cost and the visit fee.

"To find out how much James spent, first, we need to calculate the total cost of the CDs. 

The cost of each CD is $15, and he bought 10 CDs. So, the total cost is 10 * 15 = $150.

However, he got them for 40% off. To find the discount, we need to calculate 40% of $150. 

40% of $150 is 0.4 * 150 = $60. 

So, the total cost after the discount is $150 - $60 = $90.

Now, James sells 5 CDs for $40 each. The total amount he gets from selling them is 5 * 40 = $200.

To find out how much money James is left with, we subtract the amount he spent from the amount he got from selling the CDs. 

$200 - $90 = $110.

So, James is left with $110.

The final answer is: $110"

For the sweet potatoes, she has 10 and they cost $2 each, so 10 * $2 = $20.

For the carrots, she has 4 and they cost $1.25 each, so 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, let's add the amounts together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. 

Since he swims at 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

After swimming, he rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, he has to swim the remaining 20 - 12 = 8 miles at half the speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

The time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

So, the total time taken is 6 hours (swimming) + 3 hours (resting) + 8 hours (swimming) = 17 hours.

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first find out how many points Dinar scored. 

Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, and Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, we can set up the following equations:

Let's say Dinar scored x points.
Then, Azibo scored x + 10 points.
And Bahati scored x + 20 points.

We know that the total points scored by all three is 45. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x + 20) = 45

Combine like terms:

3x + 30 = 45

Subtract 30 from both sides:

3x = 15

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 5

So, Dinar scored 5 points.

Now that we know Dinar scored 5 points, we can find out how many points Azibo scored:

Azibo scored x + 10 points = 5 + 10 = 15 points.

The final answer is 15."

He worked from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is 15 hours. 

15 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 900 minutes

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we divide the total minutes by 15.

900 minutes / 15 minutes per 30 reports = 60 sets of 30 reports

So, Vince stapled 60 * 30 = 1800 reports."
"To find out how many minutes she slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep. 

First, we need to find out how long she was asleep. She usually wakes up at 6 a.m. and went to bed at 10 p.m. So, she usually sleeps for 8 hours. 

However, that day she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual. So, she woke up at 5:55 a.m. 

Now, we need to find out how long she was asleep from 2:15 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. 

5:55 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 3 hours 40 minutes 

Now, we need to add the time she was asleep from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. 

3 hours 40 minutes + 23 minutes = 4 hours 3 minutes 

Now, we need to add the time she was asleep from 10 p.m. to 2:15 a.m. 

10 p.m. to 2:15 a.m. is 4 hours 15 minutes 

4 hours 3 minutes + 4 hours 15 minutes = 8 hours 18 minutes

1/5 of 1000 beds = 100 beds

Now, we know that 100 beds are occupied. The hospital has 1000 - 100 = 900 beds left.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we need to calculate the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so in 2 weeks, there are 2 * 7 = 14 days.

Total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks = 50 * 14 = 700

"To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we need to first find the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day. 

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes, so the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 31 holes.

Since the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, we can set up the equation 4 * 31 = total holes on the fourth day. 

4 * 31 = 124

So, the island had 124 holes by the end of the fourth day. 

To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we subtract the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day from the total number of holes on the fourth day. 

124 - 31 = 93

The pirates dug 93 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure."

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Let's say Adelwolfe has caught x Pokémon. 
Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so Stan has caught 4x - 13 Pokémon. 
Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so Alex has caught 4x - 13 + 5 Pokémon. 

We know that together they have caught 339 Pokémon, so we can write the equation: 
x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 13 + 5) = 339

Combine like terms: 
x + 4x + 4x - 13 - 13 + 5 = 339
9x - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides: 
9x = 360

Divide both sides by 9: 
x = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokémon, we can find out how many Stan has caught: 
Stan has caught 4x - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 Pokémon.

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the bird in each direction and then add them together.

First, the bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time = 30 * 10 = 300 miles.

Then, the bird flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time = 18 * 2 = 36 miles.

Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time = 22 * 5 = 110 miles.

Now, we add the distances together to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes. Total distance = 300 + 36 + 110 = 446 miles.

"To find out how many brownies Greta had left over, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and subtract the number eaten.

She initially made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies, which is 12 brownies.

At her office party, she got 1/2 a dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies.

Her friends had 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies.

So, the total number of brownies she received is 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

Now, subtract the number eaten from the total number received: 66 - 18 = 48 brownies.

So, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day."
"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to calculate each of their ages first.

Nani is 8 years old.

His brother is twice his age, so his brother is 8 x 2 = 16 years old.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him. To find her age, we need to calculate 25% of Nani's age and subtract it from Nani's age. 25% of 8 is 0.25 x 8 = 2. So, Nani's sister is 8 - 2 = 6 years old.

Now, we add up the ages of all three family members: 8 (Nani) + 16 (brother) + 6 (sister) = 30.

The total age of all three family members is 30."
"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and add them together.

First, let's calculate the time for synthetic gut racquets: 3 racquets * 15 minutes per racquet = 45 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time for polyester racquets: 5 racquets * 22 minutes per racquet = 110 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time for hybrid racquets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes per racquet = 72 minutes.

Now, let's add the time for all the racquets: 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes.

The total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets is 227 minutes."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones.

The first two phones cost $600 each, so the total cost for the first two phones is 2 x $600 = $1200.

The remaining phones are 3 in total (John and his 2 kids), and each one is half the price of the first two phones, which is $300. So, the total cost for the remaining phones is 3 x $300 = $900.

Now, we add the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones: $1200 + $900 = $2100.

John paid $2100 for all the phones."
"Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team. Since Carlton's team has 13 players, Zeke's team has 13 + 7 = 20 players. 

To find the total number of players in both teams, we need to add the number of players in each team. 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33 players."
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the fence. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet. 

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10) 
Perimeter = 2 * 25 
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2.

Total number of slats = Perimeter * 2 
Total number of slats = 50 * 2 
Total number of slats = 100

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to first find out how many oranges she had left after giving some to her mom and sister. 

She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, so she gave away 2 + 2 = 4 boxes. 

Since each box contains 20 oranges, she gave away 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

She had 12 boxes initially, so she had 12 - 4 = 8 boxes left.

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 12 = 3 boxes. 

Since each box contains 20 oranges, she kept 3 * 20 = 60 oranges.

So, she had 8 - 3 = 5 boxes left to sell.

She sold 5 boxes, and each box contains 20 oranges, so she sold 5 * 20 = 100 oranges.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the total number of states in both countries, we need to first find the number of states in the USA. The USA has 50 states. 

Since India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we need to find half of 50. Half of 50 is 25. 

Then, we add 4 to 25, which is 29. So, India has 29 states. 

Now, we add the number of states in the USA (50) and India (29) to get the total number of states in both countries. 

50 + 29 = 79

"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we need to calculate the total cost of the books first. 

The total cost of the books is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has $14, he needs $39 - $14 = $25 more to afford the books.

Tyler earns $5 per hour, so we need to divide the amount he needs ($25) by his hourly wage ($5) to find out how many hours he needs to work.

$25 ÷ $5 = 5 hours.

"To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we need to know how many Richard has. Since Robert has 10 more than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries, we can subtract 10 from 30 to find out how many Richard has. 

30 - 10 = 20

So, Richard has 20 cherries. 

Now, we can subtract the number of cherries Richard has from the total number of cherries to find out how many Jerry has. 

60 - 20 = 40

Jerry has 40 cherries.

To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has.

30 - 40 = -10

Since we can't have a negative number of cherries, this means Robert has fewer cherries than Jerry."
"Let's break down the information given:

- On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread.
- On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread.
- On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie.
- On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the earnings for each day:

- Saturday: 10 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $60
- Saturday: 11 boxes of apple pie * $15 = $165
- Total earnings for Saturday: $60 + $165 = $225

- Sunday: 15 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $90
- Sunday: 15 boxes of apple pie * $15 = $225
- Total earnings for Sunday: $90 + $225 = $315

Now, let's add the earnings for both days: $225 + $315 = $540

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela needs, we need to calculate the total number of hours she'll be outside. 

She'll be outside 4 hours a day for 8 days. 
Total hours = 4 hours/day * 8 days = 32 hours

Since she reappplies sunscreen every hour, she'll need 32 bottles of sunscreen.

"To find the price of the red car, I need to calculate 40% of the blue car's price and subtract it from the blue car's price. 

40% of $100 is 0.4 x $100 = $40. 

Now, subtract $40 from the blue car's price: $100 - $40 = $60. 

The red car costs $60. 

The blue car costs $100."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Emil is 19 years old now. When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. So, his dad's age at that time will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old. 

Since Emil will be 24 years old at that time, his current age is 24 - 8 = 16 years old. 

Now, we know that Emil's brother is half the age of Emil now. So, his brother's age is 16 / 2 = 8 years old.

The sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is 48 + 8 = 56 years old.

"To find out how many beads Adrianne had altogether, we need to add the beads from her mother, sister, and friend.

Her mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads from all three: 20 + 30 + 40 = 90.

Adrianne had 90 beads altogether."
"To find out how many servings Joe has, we need to calculate the total amount of crawfish he caught.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, so 3 * 4 = 12 pounds.
On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, so 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find out how many servings: 21 / 3 = 7.

The final answer is 7."
"To find out how many students are leaving early, we need to calculate the number of students in each group. 

First, we find the number of football players: 20% of 30 students is 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Now, we find the number of students remaining after removing the football players: 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Next, we find the number of cheerleaders or band members: 25% of 24 students is 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Now, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early: 6 + 6 = 12 students.

"To find the average size of the shoes, we need to add the sizes of Charlie's and Sophie's boots and divide by 2.

Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, so if Sophie's boots are size 5, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

The average size is (5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15.

"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to convert the length of the bed from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 111 feet is equal to 111 * 12 = 1332 inches.

Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant, we need to convert that to inches as well. 1.5 feet is equal to 1.5 * 12 = 18 inches.

Now, we can calculate the total space needed for the plants and the space between them. Each plant takes up 12 inches, and there is 18 inches of space between each plant. So, the total space needed for each plant and the space between it is 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

Now, we can divide the total space available (1332 inches) by the space needed for each plant and the space between it (30 inches). 1332 / 30 = 44.4. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we can fit 44 plants in the flower bed.

Since Pat already owns 17 flowers, she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be 27 * 6 = $162.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

For 5 hanging baskets, Katherine wants to add 3 petunias each. 
3 petunias * 5 baskets = 15 petunias
15 petunias * $3.00 = $45.00

For 5 hanging baskets, Katherine wants to add 2 sweet potato vines each. 
2 sweet potato vines * 5 baskets = 10 sweet potato vines
10 sweet potato vines * $2.50 = $25.00

Now, let's add the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines together.
$45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

The total cost to fill all 5 hanging baskets is $70.00."
"To find out how many roses they can plant, we need to first calculate how much soil they used for the sunflowers and carnations. 

4 sunflowers need 4 * 3 = 12 pounds of soil. 
10 carnations need 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds of soil. 
So, they used 12 + 15 = 27 pounds of soil for the sunflowers and carnations. 

They have 30 - 27 = 3 pounds of soil left. Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses."
"To find out how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income. 

25% of $2,000 is 0.25 * $2,000 = $500.

Since she sets aside $500 each month, in a year, she sets aside $500 * 12 = $6,000.

Now, to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy, we divide the total amount she sets aside in a year by the cost of each pair of shoes.

$6,000 / $1,000 = 6.

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"To find out how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to first find out how long it takes her to peel and cook 30 shrimp, and then multiply that time by 3.

She can peel 6 shrimp a minute, so to peel 30 shrimp, it will take her 30 / 6 = 5 minutes.

She can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so to saute 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 30 = 3 times 10 minutes, which is 30 minutes.

So, it will take her 5 minutes to peel 30 shrimp and 30 minutes to saute 90 shrimp. 

Therefore, it will take her 5 + 30 = 35 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cooling effect of the air conditioner.

The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low. It ran on low for 3 hours, so it cooled the room 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room 3 degrees an hour. So, it cooled the room an additional 3 * 4 = 12 degrees.

After that, it was turned off for 2 hours, and the room warmed up 2 degrees an hour. So, the room warmed up 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the net cooling effect: 6 degrees (cooled on low) - 12 degrees (cooled on high) + 4 degrees (warmed up) = -2 degrees.

The final answer is -2."
"To find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to set up an equation. 

Let's say Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time is x. 

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old, and the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can say that the time difference between the two sightings is 75 years.

We also know that Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. 

So, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is 3 * 30 = 90 years.

Since the time difference between the two sightings is 75 years, we can set up the equation: 
x + 75 = 90

Solving for x, we get:
x = 90 - 75
x = 15

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To find out how many checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the total number of checks he writes in a year.

He writes 1 check per month for the electric bill, so that's 12 checks per year.
He writes 1 check per month for the gas bill, so that's 12 checks per year.
He writes 2 checks per month for the church, so that's 24 checks per year.
He writes 4 checks per year for the pest and lawn service (since there are 4 quarters in a year).

Now, let's add up the total number of checks: 
12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52 checks per year.

Buford writes 52 checks per year."
"To find the number of flights to France, we need to first find the total number of flights made by the first plane. 

The second plane makes 44 trips, and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes. So, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so it goes to Greece for 88 * 3/4 = 66 trips. 

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. So, the number of flights to France is 88 - 66 = 22."
"So, we have three wolves: Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous. 

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds. 
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add up the time of all three wolves' howls. 
20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we need to convert 120 seconds to minutes. 
120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to first calculate how much money he got from his parents. 

Adam's mother gave him $6. His father gave him twice as much, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12. 

In total, Adam got $6 + $12 = $18 from his parents. 

Adam bought the trousers for $30. So, he had to contribute $30 - $18 = $12 from his savings."
"To find the age of Wilfred, we need to first find the average age of the group. 

We know the total age of the children is 20, and we have the ages of Akbar and Alessandro. Let's denote the age of Helene as H and the age of Wilfred as W. 

Since Helene is twice the average age of the group, we can write the equation: 
H = 2 * (A + A + W + H) / 4

We also know that the total age of the children is 20, so A + A + H + W = 20. 

We know A = 3 and A = 4, so A = 7. 

Now we can rewrite the equation as: 
7 + 7 + H + W = 20
14 + H + W = 20
H + W = 6

Now we can substitute H = 2 * (7 + 7 + W + H) / 4 into H + W = 6. 
2 * (14 + W + H) / 4 + W = 6
2 * (14 + W + 6) / 4 + W = 6
2 * (20 + W) / 4 + W = 6
(40 + 2W) / 4 + W = 6
40 + 2W + 4W = 24
6W = -16
W = -16 / 6
W = -8/3
W = -2.67

The age of Wilfred is -2.67."

"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to calculate half of the total number of cookies. 

There were 100 guests, and each guest brought 15 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500 cookies.

Half of the cookies is 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies.

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies given to the church by 15 to find out how many people were there. 

750 / 15 = 50 people.

The answer is 50."
"To divide the watermelon, we need to know the total number of slices. Since there are 6 people, and each adult gets a slice twice as big as each kid, let's say each kid gets x slices. Then, each adult gets 2x slices.

Since there are 4 kids, the total number of slices for the kids is 4x. The total number of slices for the adults is 2x. The total number of slices is 4x + 2x = 6x.

Now, we know that the total number of slices is equal to the total weight of the watermelon. Since we don't know the weight of the watermelon, let's assume it's 1 unit (this won't affect the percentage). 

The weight of each adult's slice is 1/6 of the total weight (since there are 6 slices). The weight of each kid's slice is 1/6x of the total weight.

Since each adult gets 2x slices, the weight of each adult's slice is 2x/6 = x/3 of the total weight.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to divide the weight of each adult's slice by the total weight and multiply by 100.

(x/3) / 1 = x/3

To find the percentage, we need to know the value of x. Since we don't know the weight of the watermelon, we can't find the exact percentage. However, we can express it in terms of x.

The percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is x/3.

Since we can't find the exact percentage, we can't provide a numerical answer."
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes
Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

"To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up the time it takes to make the cake batter, bake the cake, cool the cake, and frost the cake.

First, let's convert 2 hours to minutes: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time: 
- 20 minutes to make the cake batter
- 30 minutes to bake the cake
- 120 minutes to cool the cake
- 10 minutes to frost the cake
Total time: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes: 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.

So, the total time needed to make the cake is 3 hours.

If Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we need to subtract the total time from the serving time:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, Jordan should start making the cake by 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of the students' lessons.

The cost of renting the studio is $25 per session, and it's rented 3 days a week. There are 4 weeks in a month, so the total number of sessions in a month is 3 * 4 = 12 sessions.

The cost of renting the studio for 12 sessions is 12 * $25 = $300.

The cost of the students' lessons is $1.50 per student per session. There are 10 students, so the total cost of the students' lessons is 10 * $1.50 = $15 per session. For 12 sessions, the total cost is 12 * $15 = $180.

The total expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is the sum of the cost of renting the studio and the cost of the students' lessons, which is $300 + $180 = $480.

"To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars each person has by the number of boxes they have.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so each box has 64 / 4 = 16 chocolate bars.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so each box has 56 / 7 = 8 chocolate bars.

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes from the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes.

16 - 8 = 8

Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha."
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population. 

3/5 of 50 is (3/5) * 50 = 30.

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the number of new porcupines added each month is 30 * 4 = 120.

There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of new porcupines added in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the initial population plus the new porcupines added. 

50 (initial population) + 1440 (new porcupines) = 1490.

"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = length * width * depth 
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4 
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company wants to know how many gallons of water they need, we need to convert cubic feet to gallons. There are 7.48 gallons in a cubic foot. 

1400 cubic feet * 7.48 gallons/cubic foot = 10472 gallons

Now, we need to multiply the volume by 5.9 to find out how many gallons of water they need. 

10472 gallons * 5.9 = 61928 gallons

The cost for the pool company to come and fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon.

"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to calculate the distance each of them traveled.

Matteo traveled at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours, so he traveled 55 * 4 = 220 miles.

Shandy traveled at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours, so she traveled 45 * 10 = 450 miles.

To find the difference, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance: 450 - 220 = 230 miles.

Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"To find the number of female students, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old. So, the number of students over 16 years old is 3000 / 2 = 1500.

One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, so the number of male students over 16 years old is 1500 / 4 = 375.

Now, we know that the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old. So, the number of students under 16 years old is also 3000 / 2 = 1500.

One-half of the students under 16 years old are male, so the number of male students under 16 years old is 1500 / 2 = 750.

To find the number of female students under 16 years old, we subtract the number of male students under 16 years old from the total number of students under 16 years old: 1500 - 750 = 750.

Now, we know the number of male students over 16 years old (375) and under 16 years old (750). To find the total number of male students, we add these two numbers: 375 + 750 = 1125.

Since the total number of students is 3000, and we know the number of male students (1125), we can find the number of female students by subtracting the number of male students from the total number of students: 3000 - 1125 = 1875.

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at this school is 1875."
"To find out how many laps each person can run, we need to follow the given information:

- Bethany can run 10 laps.
- Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
- Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
- Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. 
Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps. 
10 - 5 = 5

"To find out how much water was pumped on the first day, we need to calculate Wanda's and Ms. B's contributions.

Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped in two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the remaining amount of water is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into two parts: the first part where the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour, and the second part where it loses 7% of its capacity each hour.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x.

In the first part, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour for 5 hours. This means it loses 5 * 9% = 45% of its capacity in 5 hours. So, the remaining charge after 5 hours is x - 0.45x = 0.55x.

In the second part, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour for 3 hours. This means it loses 3 * 7% = 21% of its capacity in 3 hours. So, the remaining charge after 3 hours is 0.55x - 0.21(0.55x) = 0.55x - 0.1155x = 0.4445x.

We are given that the remaining charge after 8 hours is 28%. So, we can set up the equation:

0.4445x = 0.28

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.4445:

x = 0.28 / 0.4445
x = 0.63

So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 0.63.

The final answer is: 63"
"To find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment, we need to calculate 20% of the car's price. 

20% of $10,000 is 0.2 x $10,000 = $2,000.

Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips. So, her total hourly wage is $10 + $15 = $25.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are $25 x 40 = $1,000.

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2,000, we divide the amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings: $2,000 / $1,000 = 2 weeks.

The answer is 2."
"Jamaar has $10. He spent $.5 on peaches, $.5 on pears, $2 on kiwis, and $3.75 on apples. That's a total of $6.25 spent so far. He has $3.75 left. Plums cost $.25 each. To find out how many plums he can buy, we need to divide $3.75 by $.25. 

3.75 ÷ 0.25 = 15

Jamaar can buy 15 plums."
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we need to first find out how many pieces of sweets she gave away. 

Anne kept 2 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, she kept 2 * 60 = 120 pieces.

She gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs. Since each pack has 60 pieces, she gave away 13 * 60 = 780 pieces.

Now, she gave 780 pieces to 10 friends. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide 780 by 10. 

780 / 10 = 78

So, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the price increase each year.

Year 1: 
The price of carrots increases by 5% of the original price. 
5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
New price = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
The price of carrots increases by 5% of the new price. 
5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
New price = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
The price of carrots increases by 5% of the new price. 
5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
New price = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

The final answer is: 139"
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

Olivia uploaded 72 pictures and put them into 8 albums. 

72 ÷ 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies, and the rest are portraits, we can find the number of portraits by subtracting the number of selfies from the total number of albums.

3 (selfies) + 2 (portraits) = 5 albums

Now, we know that 5 albums are portraits. Since each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply the number of portraits by the number of pictures per album.

5 (portraits) * 9 (pictures per album) = 45

So, Olivia has 45 portraits.

The number of selfies is 3.

The final answer is 45."
"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to divide the total number of pages he read by the number of pages he reads per minute. 

He reads 18 pages and it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages. 

First, we find out how many minutes it takes him to read 1 page. 
10 minutes / 3 pages = 3.33 minutes per page

Now, we multiply the number of pages he read by the time it takes to read 1 page. 
18 pages * 3.33 minutes per page = 60 minutes

The final answer is 60."
"To find the number of guests the hotel has now, we need to calculate the total number of guests who checked in and subtract the number of guests who checked out.

First, let's calculate the number of guests who checked in. 
15 guests opted for a late checkout, and twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. 
So, 2 * 15 = 30 guests checked in.

Then, 7 more people checked in after dinner. 
So, the total number of guests who checked in is 30 + 7 = 37.

Now, let's calculate the total number of guests who checked out. 
24 guests checked out in the morning and 15 checked out in the afternoon. 
So, the total number of guests who checked out is 24 + 15 = 39.

Now, we subtract the number of guests who checked out from the number of guests who checked in to find the current number of guests. 
37 (checked in) - 39 (checked out) = -2. 

However, we can't have a negative number of guests. This means that the hotel is now empty."
"To find out how many bananas John has, we need to add the bananas he picked on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. 

First, we add the bananas he picked on Wednesday and Thursday: 4 + 6 = 10.

Then, we find out how many bananas he picked on Friday. He picked triple the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday, so 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, we add the bananas he picked on Friday to the total: 10 + 12 = 22.

John has 22 bananas."
"To find out how many points Aries is sure to get, we need to calculate the number of easy, average, and difficult questions she can answer correctly.

There are 60 questions in total. 40% of the questions are easy, so the number of easy questions is 0.4 * 60 = 24.

Since the rest of the questions are divided equally between average and difficult, there are 60 - 24 = 36 questions left. Half of these are average and half are difficult, so there are 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries can answer 75% of the easy questions correctly, which is 0.75 * 24 = 18 questions.

She can also answer half of the average and difficult questions correctly, which is 0.5 * (18 + 18) = 18 questions.

So, in total, Aries is sure to get 18 + 18 = 36 questions correctly.

The final answer is: 36"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Teresa earned from selling the large stuffed animals. Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, let's say she sold 'x' large stuffed animals. Then, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.

The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal. Since each small stuffed animal costs $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

Teresa earned $120 from the sales. So, the total amount she earned from selling large stuffed animals is $12x and from small stuffed animals is $4 * 2x = $8x.

The total amount she earned is the sum of the money from large and small stuffed animals, which is $12x + $8x = $20x. We know that this total is $120.

$20x = $120

To find 'x', we divide both sides by 20.

x = $120 / 20
x = 6

Since 'x' represents the number of large stuffed animals, and she sold twice as many small stuffed animals, the number of small stuffed animals is 2x.

Number of small stuffed animals = 2 * 6
= 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to multiply the number of sandwiches each person eats per day by the number of days in a week. 

There are 7 days in a week. 

So, the total number of sandwiches eaten by the man is 5 * 7 = 35. 
The total number of sandwiches eaten by the wife is 4 * 7 = 28. 
The total number of sandwiches eaten by the son is 2 * 7 = 14.

Now, we add the total number of sandwiches eaten by each family member: 35 + 28 + 14 = 77.

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings first. 

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so that's 80 * $1 = $80. 
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so that's 60 * $4 = $240. 
Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

Then, she gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave them 2 * $10 = $20. 
Now, we subtract the money she gave her sisters from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings."
"To find the number of eggs the friends found, we need to subtract the number of eggs the Smith twins found and the number of eggs that were not found by their friends from the total number of eggs.

The Smith twins found 30 eggs each, so together they found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

There were 100 eggs in total, and 10 eggs were not found by their friends. So, the number of eggs the friends found is 100 - 60 - 10 = 30.

The friends found 30 eggs."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. 

First, we know that one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. 

With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, so he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day. 

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, so he can mine 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, we know that one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe. 

Since there are 40 dwarves, the total amount of ore mined per day is 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds.

To find the total amount of ore mined in a month, we multiply the daily amount by 30 days. 

So, 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich in the first two packages. 

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.50. 
The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.50.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. 
So, the price of the package with 8 sandwiches is 8 * $1.50 = $12."
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to first calculate how much he still owes for the bedroom set after selling his old one.

Tom bought the bedroom set for $3000 and sold his old one for $1000. So, he has $3000 - $1000 = $2000 left to pay.

Now, he has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month. 10% of $2000 is 0.1 x $2000 = $200.

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"To find the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the number of red balloons that burst: 
   25 red balloons * 40% = 25 * 0.4 = 10 red balloons burst.

2. Calculate the number of red balloons remaining: 
   25 red balloons - 10 red balloons = 15 red balloons.

3. Calculate the number of yellow balloons released: 
   12 yellow balloons * 0.5 = 6 yellow balloons released.

4. Calculate the number of yellow balloons remaining: 
   12 yellow balloons - 6 yellow balloons = 6 yellow balloons.

5. Calculate the number of blue balloons added: 
   8 blue balloons * 0.75 = 6 blue balloons added.

6. Calculate the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school: 
   15 red balloons + 6 yellow balloons + 6 blue balloons = 27 balloons.

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the different scenarios.

If the normal teacher comes in, there's a 60% chance she won't give an extension (100% - 40%). In this case, Marcus will have to turn in his homework. So, the chance of Marcus having to turn in his homework if the normal teacher comes in is 60% * 50% = 30%.

If the substitute teacher comes in, there's a 60% chance she'll give an extension (100% - 40%). In this case, Marcus won't have to turn in his homework. So, the chance of Marcus not having to turn in his homework if the substitute teacher comes in is 60% * 50% = 30%.

If the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 80% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment (100% - 20%). In this case, Marcus won't have to turn in his homework. So, the chance of Marcus not having to turn in his homework if the whole class doesn't get an extension is 80% * 10% = 8%.

Now, we add up the chances of Marcus not having to turn in his homework in each scenario: 30% + 30% + 8% = 68%. 

The chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 100% - 68% = 32%.

"To find out how many tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family, we need to first find out how many tickets are left after accounting for the graduates and faculty.

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center = 6000
Seats for graduates = 950
Seats for faculty = 300

Total seats taken = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now, subtract the total seats taken from the total capacity to find out how many seats are left for the graduates to give to their friends and family.

Seats left = 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family.

Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950 = 5

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat. 

First, we know that it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, he can eat 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.

Since eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean, we can divide the number of medium-sized beans by 3 to find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat. 

150 / 3 = 50

So, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school and the total amount of money he earned after graduating.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school. He took 4 years to finish college and got $50,000 in loans per year. So, the total amount of money he lost is:

$50,000 x 4 years = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim earned after graduating. His college degree tripled his income, so his new income is:

$25,000 x 3 = $75,000 per year

Since he worked for 4 years after graduating, the total amount of money he earned is:

$75,000 x 4 years = $300,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay off the loans and the money lost while in school. This is the sum of the total amount of money he lost and the total amount of money he earned after graduating:

$200,000 + $300,000 = $500,000

To find out how long it would take Jim to earn this amount, we can divide the total amount by his new income:

$500,000 ÷ $75,000 per year = 6.67 years

So, it would take Jim approximately 6.67 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost while in school.

"To find the total area of fabric needed, we need to calculate the area of the two pieces of fabric. 

First, we need to find the dimensions of the fabric. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. The fabric will be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, so the fabric will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet long and 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.

The area of the fabric is length times width, so 8 * 10 = 80 square feet. Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area by 2. 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find out how many letters were delivered on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, we need to calculate each day separately.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. 
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery. 
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Combine like terms:
x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920
4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:
4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4:
x = 420

So the first person took $420.

"To find the total hours of work, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team. 

First, we need to find the total hours worked by the team. Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks, we need to convert 3 weeks into days. There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is 3 x 7 = 21 days.

Now, we multiply the number of days by the fraction of the day they worked: 21 days * 3/8 = 21 * 3/8 = 63/8 = 7.875 days.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply the total days by 24: 7.875 * 24 = 189 hours.

Now, we divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours each painter worked: 189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours per painter.

The final answer is 47.25."
"To solve this problem, let's use variables to represent the number of balls Rory retrieved in each set. Let's say the number of balls retrieved in the second set is x. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

We know that the total number of balls retrieved is 19. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Year 2007: The car is worth $20,000.
Year 2008: The car depreciates by 21% of $20,000, which is $4,200. So, the car is worth $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800.
Year 2009: The car depreciates by 21% of $15,800, which is $3,306.80. So, the car is worth $15,800 - $3,306.80 = $12,493.20.
Year 2010: The car depreciates by 21% of $12,493.20, which is $2,616.928. So, the car is worth $12,493.20 - $2,616.928 = $9,876.272.

The price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9,876.27.

"To find the number of Spanish books, we need to first find the number of books written in English and German. 

Half of the 50 books are written in English, so that's 50 / 2 = 25 books. 
10% of the 50 books are written in German, so that's 0.1 * 50 = 5 books.

Now, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books to find the number of Spanish books. 
50 - 25 - 5 = 20

There are 20 Spanish books."
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she already drove from the total distance.

Total distance = 1955 kilometers
Distance driven = 325 kilometers

Distance left = Total distance - Distance driven
Distance left = 1955 - 325
Distance left = 1630 kilometers

She still needs to drive 1630 kilometers."
"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first find out how many cups she drinks in 30 days. 

She drinks 8 cups a day, so in 30 days, she drinks 8 * 30 = 240 cups.

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we divide 240 cups by 16 to get the number of gallons. 

240 / 16 = 15

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, there were 120 people on the train.

At the first stop, 20 more people boarded, so the total number of people became 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people descended, and 50 * 2 = 100 people boarded. So, the total number of people became 140 - 50 + 100 = 190.

At the third stop, 80 more people descended, so the total number of people became 190 - 80 = 110.

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110.

"To find out how much Alison spent, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items she bought.

The tank top costs $10.
The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
The athletic socks cost $8, and she had a coupon for $2 off, so they cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55.

Alison spent $55 on athletic gear."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total number of tiles needed. Since each tile is 1ft by 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 square foot. 

The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 square feet. To find the total number of tiles needed, we divide the total area by the area of each tile: 200 / 1 = 200 tiles.

Now, we multiply the total number of tiles by the cost of each tile: 200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400.

The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor is $2400."
"To find the cost of the insurance after the accident, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost.

60% of $120 is 0.6 x $120 = $72.

The new cost is $120 + $72 = $192.

Since James has to pay this for a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12.

$192 x 12 = $2304.

The final answer is: 2304"
"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads per week and then multiply it by 52.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. 
Since his laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, he does 2 loads of twin sheets and 1 load of king sheets per week.

So, the total number of loads per week is 2 + 1 = 3 loads.

Now, we multiply the number of loads per week by 52 weeks in a year: 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers, so he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.
This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, so he collected 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.
Now, Leo has 100 + 150 + 100 = 350 stickers.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many slices Jake ate. 

We know Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake. So, Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

We also know Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. So, Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

Now, we know how many slices each person ate. To find the total number of slices eaten, we add the slices eaten by each person: 10 (Becky) + 7 (Jake) + 14 (Silvia) = 31 slices.

"To find out how long Betsy's part was, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Donovan's part took x minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes. The total time they took to make the meal is 98 minutes. So, we can write the equation: x + (x + 18) = 98. 

Now, let's solve the equation: 
x + x + 18 = 98
2x + 18 = 98
2x = 80
x = 40

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's part took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of the visit, the cost of the cast, the cost of the painkillers, and the cost of parking.

First, let's calculate the cost of the visit. The doctor charges $300/hour for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the painkillers. The doctor charges $4/pill for 30 painkillers. Since we don't know the exact number of pills, we'll assume it's 30 pills. The cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

Now, let's calculate the cost of parking. The doctor charges $6/hour for 2 hours, so the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Finally, let's add up the costs: the cost of the visit ($150), the cost of the cast ($200), the cost of the painkillers ($120), and the cost of parking ($12). The total cost is $150 + $200 + $120 + $12 = $482.

He gets 80 emails a day, and 20% of those don't require a response. 20% of 80 is 0.2 x 80 = 16. 

So, 80 - 16 = 64 emails require a response. 

Since James works 5 days a week, he responds to 64 x 5 = 320 emails in a week."

"To find out how many pizzas are left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas each group ate and subtract that from the total number of pizzas.

The glee club ate 70% of 20 pizzas. 
70% of 20 is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas.

The football team ate 80% of twice as many pizzas as the glee club. 
The football team ate 80% of 40 pizzas. 
80% of 40 is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

Now, let's add the number of pizzas eaten by both groups. 
14 (glee club) + 32 (football team) = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 + 40 = 60. 
Now, let's subtract the number of pizzas eaten from the total number of pizzas ordered. 
60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the number of small and big coupons first. 

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons, so he will send out 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.

The total number of coupons is 700 + 1400 = 2100.

The cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

The cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

The total cost of postage is 3500 + 21000 = 26200 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100. So, 26200 cents is 262 dollars.

The total cost of postage is 262 dollars."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means she ordered 10 - 3 = 7 sub sandwiches.

Then, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's sub sandwiches, so we need to subtract 4 from 7. 7 - 4 = 3.

Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, so now she has 3 + 3 = 6 sub sandwiches.

Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, we multiply the number of sub sandwiches by 4. 6 * 4 = 24.

The answer is 24."
"To find the total number of trucks that could not deliver fertiliser, we need to calculate a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched. 

A quarter of 20 trucks is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered is 5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons.

The total number of trucks that could deliver fertiliser is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons.

The total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons."
"To find out how much butter Dennis needs, we need to calculate the total pounds of butter he needs for 6 dozen croissants. Since he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants, he needs 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store has a promotion where you buy one pound of butter, get one half off. This means that for every pound of butter, Dennis will pay $2.00 instead of $4.00.

So, to buy 6 pounds of butter, Dennis will pay 6 * $2.00 = $12.00.

The final answer is: $12.00"

1/4 of $60 is $15. So, Maggie spent $15.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 of $60. 
1/3 of $60 is $20. So, Riza spent $20.

Now, let's subtract the money they spent from the total amount they had:
$120 - $15 - $20 = $85

So, they have $85 left."
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats, we need to know how many bananas the first two monkeys eat in a day. 

The first monkey eats 10 bananas a day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas a day. 

The total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a day is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas. 

Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, the third monkey eats 315 - 24 = 291 bananas in a week. 

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats in a day, we divide 291 by 7. 

291 / 7 = 41.57 

So, the third monkey eats approximately 41.57 bananas a day."

"To find out how many quarters Jenny will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses first. 

She bought 15 roses, and since a dozen is 12, she bought 1 and a half dozen roses. That's 1 dozen (12 roses) and 3 extra roses. 

The cost of 1 dozen roses is $15. The cost of 3 extra roses is 3 * $2 = $6. So the total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny has 5 dollars. To find out how much change she needs, we subtract the cost from the money she has: $5 - $21 = -$16. Since she can't have a negative amount of money, this means she doesn't have enough money to buy the roses. 

However, if we assume she has more money, let's calculate the change she would have if she had enough money. The change would be $21 - $5 = $16. Since she can only get quarters for change, we need to divide $16 by $0.25 (the value of a quarter). 

$16 / $0.25 = 64 quarters.

Since she can't have a fraction of a quarter, we round down to the nearest whole number. So, she would have 64 quarters."

"To find out how long Paul will wait, we need to calculate the time between the first train's arrival and the fourth train's departure.

The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, it leaves the station in 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station in 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it leaves the station in 125 minutes.

The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the time Paul will board his train.

Now, we need to find out how long Paul will wait. He arrives at the station when the first train leaves, which is 30 minutes. He will board the fourth train at 145 minutes. So, the time Paul will wait is 145 - 30 = 115 minutes.

"To find the original price of the watch, we need to calculate 100% of the sale price. 

Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, so the sale price is 0.75 times the original price. 

Let's call the original price 'x'. Then, the sale price is 0.75x.

Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is 1.2 times the sale price. 

So, the selling price is 1.2 * 0.75x = 0.9x.

The original price is x, and the selling price is 0.9x. 

The discount is the difference between the original price and the selling price, which is x - 0.9x = 0.1x.

To find the percentage discount, we need to divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100. 

The percentage discount is (0.1x / x) * 100 = 10%.

"To solve this, we need to calculate the number of jellyfish created per hour by one spring, then multiply it by the number of springs and the number of hours.

Since a spring creates a new jellyfish every second, it creates 1 jellyfish per 60 seconds. 

There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, 60 minutes in 1 hour. 
So, in 1 hour, a spring creates 1 jellyfish/60 seconds * 60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 1 jellyfish per hour.

"To find out how many bikes of each type were sold, we need to calculate the number of each type first.

We know that half of the bikes sold were Trekking bikes. Since there were 300 bikes sold in total, half of them would be 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

We also know that 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes. 15% of 300 bikes is 0.15 * 300 = 45 BMX bikes.

The rest of the bikes were MTB. Since we know the number of Trekking and BMX bikes, we can subtract them from the total to find the number of MTB bikes. 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

Now, we know the number of each type of bike sold. We can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of each type by its price and adding them together.

The price of an MTB is $500, so 105 MTB bikes would be 105 * 500 = $52,500.
The price of a BMX bike is half the price of an MTB, so it's $250. 45 BMX bikes would be 45 * 250 = $11,250.
The price of a Trekking bike is $450. 150 Trekking bikes would be 150 * 450 = $67,500.

Adding these together, Marcel earned $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000."
"To find the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards. 

The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, so the velociraptors must have eaten half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. This means the velociraptors ate 270 kilograms. 

Since the velociraptors ate half of what was left, the T-Rex must have eaten the other half. So, the velociraptors ate 270 kilograms, which is half of the amount the T-Rex ate. 

To find the amount the T-Rex ate, we multiply 270 by 2. 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms.

Now, we know the T-Rex ate 540 kilograms. Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops must be twice the amount the T-Rex ate. 

540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms.

The answer is: 1080"
"To find the total area to be painted, we need to calculate the area of each wall and add them together. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each of them is 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each of them is 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

Now, we add the total area of all four walls: 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of 12 gallons of paint is 12 x $12 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the number of shaken cans and the total number of cans left.

Initially, Ellen shook 3 cans. Then, her brother took 1 shaken can, leaving 2 shaken cans. 

Ellen's friend can get sprayed from the 2 remaining shaken cans. 

There are a total of 12 cans initially, and 5 cans are left (2 shaken and 3 unshaken). 

The probability that Ellen's friend gets sprayed from a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans left: 2/5 = 0.4 or 40%."
"To find the distance between the two trains, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled after 3 hours. 

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. So, in 3 hours, it will travel 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. So, in 3 hours, it will travel 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them. 

180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find out how many people Billy can help, we need to first find out how many days he is available to help. 

There are 31 days in March. Billy takes 20% of the days off, so we need to find 20% of 31. 

20% of 31 is 0.2 x 31 = 6.2. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round down to 6 days off. 

Billy is available to help 31 - 6 = 25 days. 

Billy can help 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day. So, he can help 2 x 3 = 6 people per day. 

To find the total number of people he can help, we multiply the number of days he is available by the number of people he can help per day. 

25 days x 6 people per day = 150 people. 

The final answer is 150."
"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars.

First, let's calculate the total number of people in the buses:
12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people in the cars:
20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Now, let's add the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars to find the total number of people outside the church:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since Mary and John are also inside the church, we need to add 2 to the total number of people outside the church to find the total number of people inside the church:
480 people + 2 people = 482 people

The final answer is: 482"
"To find Jeff's age, we need to work backwards from Mike's age. 

Since Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, and Mike is 24 years old, Martha's age is 24 - 4 = 20 years old.

Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so Jeff's age is 20 + 10 = 30 years old.

"To find out how long it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed.

For the biggest slide: 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes
For the second biggest slide: 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we need to find the difference in time: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The biggest slide takes 2 minutes longer than the second biggest slide."
"To find the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total minutes first. 

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 15-minute breaks per day. 
30 minutes + 2 * 15 minutes = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60. 
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

So, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 1 hour per day.

Since this is for 5 days, we multiply the daily time by 5. 
1 hour * 5 days = 5 hours

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many miles Micah ran, we need to multiply Amber's distance by 3.5. 

Amber ran 8 miles. 
Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so Micah ran 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles.

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. 
We already know that Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 28 miles. 
So, the distance run by Ahito is 52 - (8 + 28) = 52 - 36 = 16 miles.

"To find the new balance on her credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought after the discounts.

First, let's calculate the discount on the frying pan:
Original price: $20.00
Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Discounted price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Next, let's calculate the discount on the towels:
Original price: $30.00
Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
Discounted price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items she bought:
Frying pan: $16.00
Towels: $27.00
Total cost: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card and returned $15.00, so the new balance before the new purchases is:
$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Now, let's add the total cost of the new items to the new balance:
$70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

The new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's say the total number of jellyfish in the tank is x.

A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5)/3 = x/15.

The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of small jellyfish is also x/5.

We know that when the UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color. These 6 jellyfish are the large jellyfish that change color, so we can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

"To find Caroline's age, we need to follow the given information. 

First, we know Chris is 4 years old. 
Since Ben is two times older than Chris, we multiply Chris's age by 2 to find Ben's age. 
Ben's age = 2 * 4 = 8 years old.

Now, we know Caroline is three times older than Ben. 
Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age = 3 * 8 = 24 years old.

The final answer is 24."
"To find out how much Lauren saves each year, we need to calculate 20% of her current salary. 

20% of $100,000 is 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000.

Since Lauren lives on 40% of her current salary, she saves 60% of her salary. 

60% of $100,000 is 0.60 * $100,000 = $60,000.

Now, we need to find out how much Lauren needs for retirement. Since she plans to live on 40% of her salary, she needs 60% of her salary for retirement. 

60% of $100,000 is 0.60 * $100,000 = $60,000.

Since Lauren saves $20,000 per year, we need to find out how many years it will take her to save $60,000. 

$60,000 / $20,000 = 3 years.

So, Lauren needs to work for 3 more years to save enough for her retirement."
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to divide the ribbon into 4 equal parts, and then divide each of those parts into 5 equal parts.

First, we divide 100 centimeters by 4: 100 / 4 = 25 centimeters per part.

Then, we divide 25 centimeters by 5: 25 / 5 = 5 centimeters per final cut.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we need to divide the number of boys by the percentage of boys. 

First, we need to convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100. 
40% = 40 / 100 = 0.4

Now, we can divide the number of boys by the decimal equivalent of the percentage of boys to find the total number of students.
240 / 0.4 = 600

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

The number of girls in the school is the total number of students minus the number of boys.
600 - 240 = 360

The final answer is: 360"

"To find the average height of the heels, we need to add up the total height of all the heels and divide by the total number of heels.

The total height of the heels is 3 x 4 = 12 inches (for the 4-inch heels) and 3 x 2 = 6 inches (for the 2-inch heels). 
So, the total height is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

There are 6 heels in total. 
The average height of the heels is 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

"Soledad is planning to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days. She wants to hike twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. 

To find out how many miles she needs to hike per day, we need to divide the total miles by the number of days. 

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since she is already hiking 125 miles per day, we need to find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day to reach 310 miles.

310 miles - 125 miles = 185 miles

So, Soledad needs to hike 185 miles more per day to complete her journey on time.

"To find the total amount the store will receive, we need to calculate the total cost of all the balls.

Red balls cost $9 each, and there are 3 of them, so 3 x $9 = $27.
Blue balls cost $5 each, and there are 11 of them, so 11 x $5 = $55.
Green balls cost $3 each, and there are 25 of them, so 25 x $3 = $75.

Now, let's add up the total amount: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157.

The store will receive $157 after all the balls are sold."

So, Pierre gets 3 kg and Paul gets 4 kg. 

Now, let's add the kilograms that Pierre and Paul have together: 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

Since they started with 12 kg, we subtract the amount they have from the total: 12 - 7 = 5 kg.

So, James will have 5 kg left."

Dior took over 4 hours longer than Amalia, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, we add up the time it took for each person to complete their chores: 
Amalia (4 hours) + Megan (6 hours) + Dior (8 hours) = 18 hours.

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers. 

Two workers produce 6 toys an hour, so together they produce 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour. 
The other two workers produce 4 toys an hour, so together they produce 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour. 
So, the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour. 

Since there are 5 workers, and they work for 10 hours, the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 20 * 10 = 200 toys. 

The manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, so the total number of toys needed is 200 + 20 = 220 toys. 

Since the order is for 400 toys, the fifth worker must produce 400 - 220 = 180 toys. 

Since the fifth worker works for 10 hours, the number of toys produced by the fifth worker per hour is 180 / 10 = 18 toys per hour."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. We also know that Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's say Sarah painted x eggs. Then, Camden painted x + 12 eggs.

Since Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 12) = 30

Combine like terms:

2x + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides:

2x = 18

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 9

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs. Since Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now, we know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Let's call this number y. We know that the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. So, we can set up the equation:

y + y + 21 + 9 = 56

Combine like terms:

2y + 30 = 56

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2y = 26

Divide both sides by 2:

y = 13

So, Arnold and Madeline each painted 13 eggs.

Now, we can find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:

Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs. So, Camden painted 21 - 13 = 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"To find the total weight of the crayons, we need to find out how many boxes Nik can fill with crayons. 

Since each box can hold 8 crayons, and Nik has 200 crayons, we divide 200 by 8 to get 25 boxes. 

Now, we need to find the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, and there are 25 boxes, the total weight of the crayons is 25 * 1 = 25 ounces.

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, and there are 25 boxes, the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Now, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we divide the total weight in ounces by 16. 

Total weight in pounds = 200 ounces / 16 = 12.5 pounds.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 225 ounces. Converting this to pounds, we get 225 / 16 = 14.0625 pounds.

The final answer is 14.0625."
"To find out how many logs John can make, we need to divide the total length of the tree by the length of each log.

Since each log can be cut into 5 planks, we multiply the number of logs by 5.

20 logs * 5 planks per log = 100 planks

John sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

100 planks * $1.2 per plank = $120

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns 2 x $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

The total amount of money they all have together is $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000."
"To find the time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk, we need to first find the time she spends on the sidewalk. 

Since she walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk, and she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk, we can assume she walks at x miles per minute on the beach. Then, she walks at 2x miles per minute on the sidewalk.

We know that 40 minutes is spent on the beach, so 2x * 40 = 80 miles. 

Now, we can find x by dividing 80 by 2, which is 40 miles per minute. 

So, she walks at 40 miles per minute on the beach and 80 miles per minute on the sidewalk. 

Now, we can find the time it takes for her to walk 2 miles on the beach, which is 2 / 40 = 0.05 minutes. 

The time it takes for her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is 1 / 80 = 0.0125 minutes. 

The total time it takes for her to complete the entire 3-mile walk is 0.05 + 0.0125 = 0.0625 minutes.

$60 - $32 = $28

Since she saves $4 per week, we need to divide $28 by $4 to find out how many more weeks it will take for her to save $28.

$28 / $4 = 7

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60."

Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug. Since he can drink the water after this, the total amount of water he has is 5 ounces. 

The total temperature of the water he has is the sum of the temperatures of the two mugs. Since he can drink the water, the total temperature must be at least 40 degrees. 

We can set up an equation to represent this:

(33 * 4) + (x * 1) >= 40

Simplifying the equation:

132 + x >= 40

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x >= 8

So, the second mug must be at least 8 degrees."
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.

Melkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, in three weeks there are 3 x 7 = 21 days. So, the total number of cows added is 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows.

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. In three weeks, there are 21 days, so the total number of chickens added is 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.

Now, let's add the initial number of animals to the number of animals added:

Cows: 50 + 420 = 470 cows
Chickens: 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

"To find the total cost of 4 packs of bagels, we need to calculate the cost of 4 packs first. 

4 packs of bagels cost 4 * $10.00 = $40.00

Since Russell gets a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $40.00. 

10% of $40.00 is 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Since there are 9 bagels in each pack, we need to divide the total cost by 9 to find the cost of each bagel.

$36.00 / 9 = $4.00

So, each single bagel will cost $4.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

So, 3 scoops of mashed potatoes require 3 less than 6 potatoes, which is 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes.

Now, we know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many scoops, we need to subtract 5 from 23. 

23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Now, we know that 3 scoops require 3 potatoes. To find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we need to multiply the number of scoops by the number of potatoes per scoop.

18 scoops * 3 potatoes/scoop = 54 potatoes.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find out how many eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, he eats 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day. So, he eats 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

Now, we add the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days. 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we divide 240 by 12 to get the number of dozens. 240 / 12 = 20.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we need to first find the total number of red jellybeans. Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans, there must be 2 * 17 = 34 red jellybeans.

Now, we know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We also know that there are 17 green jellybeans and 34 red jellybeans. So, the number of blue jellybeans can be found by subtracting the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans.

Number of blue jellybeans = Total number of jellybeans - (Number of green jellybeans + Number of red jellybeans)
= 60 - (17 + 34)
= 60 - 51

30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

The answer is 300."
"To find the number of women on the bus, we first need to find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 9 = 14. 

We can then divide the total number of passengers by the total number of parts to find the value of one part. 84 / 14 = 6. 

Since the ratio of women is 9 parts, we multiply 9 by 6 to find the number of women on the bus initially. 9 * 6 = 54. 

Now, 20 women alight from the bus, so we subtract 20 from 54. 54 - 20 = 34.

"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we need to first find out how many bouquets he sold. 

He earned $56 from the bouquet per day, and he did this for 3 days. So, he earned 3 * $56 = $168 from the bouquets. 

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we can divide the total amount earned from bouquets ($168) by the cost of each bouquet ($8) to find out how many bouquets he sold: $168 / $8 = 21 bouquets.

Now, we know that each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, so we multiply the number of bouquets by 12 to find out how many sunflowers he sold: 21 * 12 = 252 sunflowers.

The final answer is: 252"
"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks and the total amount he earns from selling them.

Adam buys 100 rocks for $5 each, so the total cost is 100 * 5 = $500.

He sells 60% of his inventory, which is 0.6 * 100 = 60 rocks. He sells each rock for $7, so the total amount he earns is 60 * 7 = $420.

To find out how much he loses, we subtract the amount he earns from the total cost: 500 - 420 = $80.

Adam loses $80."
"To find out how many days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days it will take to complete each type of picture scene and then add them together.

For large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
For medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
For small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

Now, we add the days together: 9 days + 6 days + 7 days = 22 days

"To find out how many eggs each child gets, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. 

First, we need to convert three dozen eggs into a single unit. Since one dozen is 12, three dozen is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, we divide the total number of eggs (36) by the number of children (4). 

36 ÷ 4 = 9

So, each child receives 9 eggs."
"To find out how much Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to know how many days are in May. May has 31 days. 

Since each fish needs $1 worth of food a day, we multiply the number of days in May by the cost of food per day. 

31 days * $1 = $31

Jen spends $31 on food for her fish in May."
"To find out how many roses Patricia has now, we need to subtract the roses she gave to her mother from the total number of roses she had initially, then add the roses she bought.

She initially had 30 roses.
She gave 24 roses to her mother, so she had 30 - 24 = 6 roses left.
Then, she bought 15 more roses, so she now has 6 + 15 = 21 roses.

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which is 0.2 in decimal form.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

Now, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

The probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"To find out how many seashells each person got, we need to first figure out how many seashells each person collected.

Since Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected, we can find out how many Carlos collected by subtracting 5 from 27. 

27 - 5 = 22

So, Carlos collected 22 seashells.

Now, since Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, we can divide 22 by 2 to find out how many Carrey collected.

22 / 2 = 11

So, Carrey collected 11 seashells.

Now that we know how many seashells each person collected, we can divide the total number of seashells by 3 to find out how many each person got.

Total seashells = 27 (Jim) + 22 (Carlos) + 11 (Carrey) = 60

60 / 3 = 20

Each person got 20 seashells."
"Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays, which are 5 days. So, he eats 4 * 5 = 20 carrots on weekdays. 

He also eats 5 carrots on Saturday and Sunday, which are 2 days. So, he eats 5 * 2 = 10 carrots on the weekend.

In total, Mason eats 20 + 10 = 30 carrots a week."
"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. 

The second song is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes. 
60% of 5 minutes is 0.6 * 5 = 3 minutes. 
So, the second song is 5 + 3 = 8 minutes long.

Now, we add the time of both songs together: 5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes.

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price.

Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday, so the total number of devices is 2 + 4 = 6.

He bought each device for $20, so the total cost is 6 * $20 = $120.

He sells each device for twice the original price, so he sells each device for 2 * $20 = $40.

The total selling price is 6 * $40 = $240.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost, which is $240 - $120 = $120.

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total energy demand of 2300 people.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the total energy demand of 2300 people as follows:

2300 people * 20% = 2300 * 0.2 = 460 bottles

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles they need to produce to meet the demand of 2300 people.

460 bottles (total demand) - 4200 (current production) = -1740 bottles

Since we can't produce a negative number of bottles, this means that Hortex can already meet the energy demand of 2300 people with their current production."
"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the total number of babies wearing a bow and the number of purple babies wearing a bow.

There are 8 babies in total. 3/4 of them are dressed in purple, so 3/4 * 8 = 6 babies are dressed in purple. 1/4 of them are dressed in blue, so 1/4 * 8 = 2 babies are dressed in blue.

1/3 of the purple wearers also wear a bow. So, 1/3 * 6 = 2 purple babies wear a bow.

Now, we need to find the total number of babies wearing a bow. We know 2 purple babies wear a bow, and 1/3 of the blue babies also wear a bow. 1/3 * 2 = 2/3 of the blue babies wear a bow. Since there are 2 blue babies, 2/3 * 2 = 1 blue baby wears a bow.

So, the total number of babies wearing a bow is 2 (purple) + 1 (blue) = 3.

The percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 2 (purple babies wearing a bow) / 3 (total babies wearing a bow) * 100 = 66.67%."

"Abraham started with 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it for $50, so he sold 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. He then sold another 1/4 of his land, which is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters. 

So, he sold 40 + 20 = 60 square meters of land. He has 80 - 60 = 20 square meters left. 

He sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter. So, he earned 20 * 3 = $60. 

Abraham initially sold 40 square meters for $50 and 20 square meters for $30. So, he earned 50 + 30 = $80. 

In total, Abraham earned 80 + 60 = $140."

"To find out how many eggs are still hidden, we need to first find out how many eggs each person found.

Lamar found 5 eggs.
Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy found 5 * 2 = 10 eggs.
Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie found 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
Mei found half as many as Charlie, so Mei found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the eggs found by each person: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Since Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs, we subtract the eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments he collects garbage from and multiply it by the amount he gets paid per apartment.

First, we need to find out how many apartments are in the last complex. Since it's 60% bigger than the other two combined, we need to find the total number of apartments in the first two complexes. 

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so together they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. 

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. So the last complex has 240 + 400 = 640 apartments.

Now, we know John collects garbage from 3 complexes, and he collects 3 times a week. So, he collects garbage 3 * 3 = 9 times a week.

The total number of apartments he collects garbage from is 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments.

He gets paid $0.40 per apartment, so he makes 1440 * 0.40 = $576 per week.

The final answer is 576."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of fruits produced by the tree in each year.

Year 4: 7 * 150 = 1050 fruits
Year 5: 7 * 350 = 2450 fruits
Year 6: 7 * 1050 = 7350 fruits
Year 7: 7 * 2450 = 17150 fruits

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Let's say the length of the yellow rope is Y. 
Since the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, the length of the blue rope is Y - 7. 
The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is 4 * (Y - 7). 

The total length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation: 
Y + (Y - 7) + 4 * (Y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms: 
Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37
6Y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides: 
6Y = 72

Divide both sides by 6: 
Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope: 
Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5

And the length of the red rope: 
4 * (Y - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

Now, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. 4/5 of 15 is 4/5 * 15 = 12.

So, Rissa has 15 - 7.5 = $7.5 left.

The question asks for Ronnie's money, but the problem doesn't mention anything about Ronnie giving any money to her sister. Therefore, Ronnie still has the $5 she was given.

"To find out how many pints of red paint were used, we need to know the total amount of paint used for each color. Since there are 4 colors and half the mural is yellow, that means the other half is divided into 3 colors. 

So, the total amount of paint used for the 3 colors (excluding yellow) is half of 12 pints, which is 6 pints. 

Since there are 3 colors (red, white, and purple) and they are equal, we divide 6 pints by 3 to find out how many pints of each color were used. 

6 pints / 3 = 2 pints per color.

Since red is one of the 3 colors, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since 1000 / 20 = 50, he has 50 bills initially.

He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he pays with 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

Thomas then triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 / 5 = 12 five-dollar bills.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Let Wendy's current age be W and Colin's current age be C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtract 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtract 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Divide both sides by 2:
20 = C

So, Colin is 20 years old now.

"So, let's break it down step by step. 

First, Newton picked up 2 apples. 
Then, he threw one of them back into the tree, so he had 1 apple left in his pocket. 
He picked up 5 more apples from the tree, so now he had 1 + 5 = 6 apples. 
Then, he threw one of them back into the tree, so he had 6 - 1 = 5 apples left. 
He picked up the remaining 6 apples from the tree, so now he had 5 + 6 = 11 apples. 

He brought 11 apples home.

"To find the total cost of the coal, we need to divide the total weight of coal (850 kg) by the weight of each bag (50 kg) to find out how many bags Ali ordered. 

850 kg / 50 kg per bag = 17 bags

Now, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag to find the total cost.

17 bags * $18 per bag = $306

The total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To find out how many pizzas Kate needs, we need to calculate the total number of slices each friend ate. 

Each friend ate 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices. 
So, each friend ate 6 + 4 = 10 slices.

Since there are 6 friends, the total number of slices eaten is 6 * 10 = 60 slices.

Since the cheese pizza has 12 slices, the number of cheese pizzas needed is 60 / 12 = 5.

Since the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is 60 / 8 = 7.5. 

Since you can't buy half a pizza, Kate needs to buy 8 pepperoni pizzas.

So, Kate needs to buy 5 cheese pizzas and 8 pepperoni pizzas.

5 + 8 = 13"
"To find the total miles Sam ran this week, we need to add the miles he ran on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and the miles he ran on Tuesday and Thursday.

Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 miles.
Sam ran 5 miles on Tuesday and Thursday, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 miles.

Now, let's add the miles: 9 + 10 = 19 miles.

The final answer is: 19"
"To find out how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to calculate how many snowballs he can build and how many he loses in a certain amount of time.

Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, he can build 20/60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. So, in 15 minutes, he loses 2 snowballs. 

To find out how many snowballs he loses per minute, we divide 2 by 15. 2/15 = 2/15 snowballs per minute.

Now, we subtract the number of snowballs he loses per minute from the number of snowballs he builds per minute. 1/3 - 2/15 = (5-2)/15 = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Since he builds 1/5 snowballs per minute, to find out how many minutes it takes to build 60 snowballs, we divide 60 by 1/5. 60 / (1/5) = 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

So, it will take Jay 300 minutes to have 60 snowballs.

"To find Jim's age, we need to go back 20 years from John's current age. 

John is 28 now, so 20 years ago, he was 28 - 20 = 8. 

Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, Jim's age 20 years ago was 8 / 2 = 4. 

Now, to find Jim's current age, we add 20 years to his age 20 years ago. So, Jim's current age is 4 + 20 = 24."
"To find out how many slices they ate, we need to add up the slices each of them ate. 

Doxa ate 1 slice. 
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices. 
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices they ate: 
1 (Doxa) + 2 (her sister) + 3 (her brother) = 6 slices.

They all ate 6 slices of apple."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the initial number of bandages is x.

On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50, so they had x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 bandages left.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. They had x + 12 - 28 = x - 16 bandages left.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50, so they had x - 16 + 100 = x + 84 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. So, they had x + 84 - 25 = x + 59 bandages left.

We know that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so we can set up the equation x + 59 = 78.

To solve for x, we subtract 59 from both sides: x = 78 - 59.

x = 19.

"To find the cost of the haircut, we need to calculate the difference in length of her hair. 

Her hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so the difference is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, so the total cost of the haircut is 2 * 30 = $60.

Adding the cost of the color, which is $40, the total cost is 60 + 40 = $100.

The final answer is 100."
"Jen works 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week. Since there are 4 weeks in April, she works a total of 7.5 * 6 * 4 = 84 hours. 

Her hourly rate is $1.5, so she earns 84 * 1.5 = $126 from her work. 

She also receives an additional $10 for every week she has complete attendance. Since she has no absences, she receives 4 * 10 = $40. 

In total, Jen will receive 126 + 40 = $166."
"To find out how much Jason earned, we need to calculate the total amount he earned from each task and add them together.

For emptying the dishwasher, he earned $0.50 per time. He did it 6 times, so he earned 6 x $0.50 = $3.00.

For doing his laundry, he earned $3.00.

For taking the trash out, he earned $1.50 per time. He did it 2 times, so he earned 2 x $1.50 = $3.00.

For cleaning his room, he earned $1.50.

Now, let's add up the total amount he earned: $3.00 + $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 = $10.50.

"Let's break down the information given:

- 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning.
- 40 more people entered at 10:00, making it 50 + 40 = 90 people.
- Then, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people.
- By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered, which is 3 * 40 = 120 people.

Now, let's add up the total number of people who entered the restaurant: 
50 (morning) + 40 (10:00) + 80 (after 10:00) + 120 (evening) = 290 people.

The total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 290."
"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and black pens separately.

Alain bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack has 5 pens. So, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 pens.

He bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. So, the total number of black pens is 2 * 25 pens = 50 pens.

Now, we add the number of red pens and black pens to get the total number of pens. Total pens = 25 pens + 50 pens = 75 pens.

"To find the total cost, we need to first find the cost of the scotch and the cognac. 

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. So, the cost per bottle of scotch is $600 / 10 = $60.

The cognac costs 50% more than the scotch. 50% of $60 is $30. So, the cognac costs $60 + $30 = $90 per bottle.

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch. He bought 10 bottles of scotch, so he bought 10 x 2 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 x $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is $600 (scotch) + $1800 (cognac) = $2400.

"To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to calculate the number of trees planted each day.

On the first day, he planted 20 White Oak trees. Since he planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, he planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so he planted 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more. So, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees.

The total number of trees planted on the first day is 20 + 40 = 60 trees. The total number of trees planted on the second day is 30 + 50 = 80 trees.

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 60 + 80 = 140 trees.

The problem states that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as:

4x + 8 = 40

Now, we need to solve for 'x'. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we divide both sides by 4:

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

So, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to calculate the height of the first floor and then the height of the roof.

The height of the house is 7 times Mattison's height, so the height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, so the height of the first floor is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Since the height of the house is 420 inches and the height of the first floor is 180 inches, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

The height of the roof is the difference between the height of the house and the height of the second floor, which is 420 - 240 = 180 inches.

"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Brian ran it for 3 days, so the total water removed at the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Brian ran it for 3 days, so the total water removed at the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Brian ran it for 5 days, so the total water removed at the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, we add the water removed at each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

Stephen borrowed $300 and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed. So, the interest is 2% of $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

The total amount Stephen needs to pay back is the original $300 plus the interest, which is $300 + $6 = $306.

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, the total amount he will pay in those months is $25 * 11 = $275.

Now, to find out how much he will pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount he paid in the first 11 months from the total amount he needs to pay back. So, $306 - $275 = $31.

Therefore, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month.

Actual number of jelly beans = Volume / 0.8 
Actual number of jelly beans = 540 / 0.8 
Actual number of jelly beans = 675

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we need to multiply the actual number of jelly beans by 0.3 to get the number of red jelly beans.

Number of red jelly beans = Actual number of jelly beans * 0.3 
Number of red jelly beans = 675 * 0.3 
Number of red jelly beans = 202.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a jelly bean, we round down to 202 red jelly beans.

Now, we know the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find how far off Tim's guess was, we subtract the actual number of red jelly beans from the estimated number of red jelly beans.

Difference = Estimated number of red jelly beans - Actual number of red jelly beans 
Difference = 202.5 - 202

"To find the length of the longer piece, we need to divide the total length of the board by 5. 

First, we need to find the length of the shorter piece. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, we can represent the length of the shorter piece as x. Then, the length of the longer piece is 4x. 

The total length of the board is 40 feet, so we can set up the equation: x + 4x = 40. 

Combine like terms: 5x = 40. 

Divide both sides by 5: x = 8.

"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the amount he earns from each type of lesson and add them together.

For the 4 1-hour lessons at the standard rate, Charlie will earn:
4 * $80 = $320

For the 2 1-hour lessons with a veteran, Charlie will earn:
2 * ($80 - (25% of $80))
First, calculate 25% of $80:
25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20
Then, subtract $20 from the standard rate:
$80 - $20 = $60
Now, multiply by 2:
2 * $60 = $120

Now, add the earnings from both types of lessons:
$320 + $120 = $440

The total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."
"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the number of scores.

First, let's add up the scores: 
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

There are 9 scores. 
Now, let's divide the sum by the number of scores: 
630 / 9 = 70

The mean score is 70."
"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to first find out how many pomelos she had left. Since she had 1/4 of the original amount left, we can calculate that as 20 * 1/4 = 5 pomelos.

So, Eve had 5 pomelos left. To find out how many she gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she had left from the original amount: 20 - 5 = 15.

Eve gave away 15 pomelos."
"To find out how many apples Walter had left after eating 2/5 of them, we need to calculate 3/5 of 60.

3/5 * 60 = 36

So, Walter had 36 apples left.

Then, he gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples. 25% of 36 is 9.

36 - 9 = 27

Walter had 27 apples left.

He sold the remaining apples to his uncle at $3 each. 

27 * 3 = 81

The final answer is 81."
"To find out how many novels Regina has written this year, we need to multiply the number of novels she wrote last year by 4. 

9 * 4 = 36

She has written 36 novels this year."
"To find the total distance covered by Michael, we need to multiply his average speed by the number of hours he traveled. 

Since he's traveling for 3 days, we need to convert the days into hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3 days is 3 x 24 = 72 hours.

Now, we multiply his average speed (50 km/hr) by the total hours (72 hours) to get the total distance covered: 50 km/hr x 72 hours = 3600 km.

To find the percentage of the distance covered, we divide the distance covered (3600 km) by the total distance (6000 km) and multiply by 100: (3600 / 6000) x 100 = 60%.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we need to work backwards.

Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes. 

The total grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the total grapes used by the mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

The total grapes at the beginning is the sum of the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and the mother. So, the total grapes at the beginning is 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

"To find out how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate the total cost per week and then multiply it by 52 weeks.

The pasta costs $1.00 per box, and he buys 1 box per week. 
The cheddar cheese costs $3.00, and the gruyere cheese costs twice that amount, which is $6.00. 
So, the total cost of cheese per week is $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00.

The total cost per week is $1.00 (pasta) + $9.00 (cheese) = $10.00.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total cost per year is $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

The final answer is 520."
"To find the total time spent cleaning, we need to multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom. 

80 classrooms * 15 minutes per classroom = 1200 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours by dividing by 60.

1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

The custodian works 8 hours a day. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning, we divide the time spent cleaning by the total hours worked and multiply by 100.

(20 hours / 8 hours) * 100 = 250%

The custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning classrooms."
"To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we need to calculate the total number of books each shelf can hold. 

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, and the middle shelf can hold 10 books. So, the bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's add up the total number of books each shelf can hold: 
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Middle shelf: 10 books
- Top shelf: 15 books

Total books: 20 + 10 + 15 = 45 books

Since Elly has 110 books, she needs more than one bookcase. 

To find out how many bookcases she needs, we can divide the total number of books by the number of books each bookcase can hold. 

Each bookcase has 45 books. 
110 books / 45 books per bookcase = 2.44

Since we can't have a fraction of a bookcase, Elly needs 3 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"To find out how many eggs Rose bought, we need to know that one dozen is 12 eggs. So, five dozens of eggs will be 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

Rose bought 60 eggs for $2.40. She will sell each egg for $1. So, she will get 60 * $1 = $60 from selling the eggs.

Her profit will be the difference between the selling price and the cost price. So, her profit will be $60 - $2.40 = $57.60."
"To find the number of white hats, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that half of the hats are red. Since there are 100 hats in total, half of them would be 100 / 2 = 50 red hats.

Now, we subtract the number of red hats from the total to find the remaining hats: 100 - 50 = 50 hats.

Next, we know that 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue. To find the number of blue hats, we multiply the remaining hats by 3/5: 50 * 3/5 = 30 blue hats.

Now, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats to find the number of white hats: 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.

"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first find the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's $3.00 off. So, the discounted price is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we need to divide the discounted price by 30 to find the cost of each stick. 

$15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100. 

$0.50 × 100 = 50 cents

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate how many questions she got right on the first test. 

She got 60% of 70 questions correct on the first test. 
60% of 70 = 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

Now, we need to find out how many questions she needs to get right in total to pass. 
She needs to get 70% of the total questions correct. 
The total number of questions is 70 + 40 = 110 questions. 
70% of 110 = 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions.

Since she already got 42 questions right on the first test, she needs to get 77 - 42 = 35 questions right on the second test to pass."
"To find out how many blueberry cubes Mary makes, we need to first find out how many strawberry cubes she makes. Let's say the number of strawberry cubes is 'x'. 

Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, the number of blueberry cubes is 5x - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116. So, the sum of strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes is 116. 

We can write this as an equation: x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combine like terms: 6x - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides: 6x = 120

Divide both sides by 6: x = 20

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes. 

Now, we can find the number of blueberry cubes: 5x - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96

The final answer is: 96"
"To find the total number of points Ara has scored, we need to multiply the number of games she played in a year by the number of points she scored in each game, and then multiply that by the number of years.

She played 40 games per year for 4 years. 
40 games/year * 4 years = 160 games
She scored 21 points per game.
160 games * 21 points/game = 3360 points

The total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is 3360."
"Brendan started with 10 marbles. He dropped half of them, so he had 10 / 2 = 5 marbles left. Then he found 3 more, so he had 5 + 3 = 8 marbles. He got rid of one bead, which isn't a marble, so he had 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know that for every 2 customers that come into the car dealership, 1 will buy a car. So, to sell 15 cars, Jason needs 15 * 2 = 30 customers.

Next, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes into the car dealership. So, to get 30 customers, Jason needs 30 * 25 = 750 telephone calls.

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of each type of light source.

First, let's find the number of rooms with small candles and medium candles. Since there are 8 rooms and half of them have small candles and the other half have medium candles, we have:

- 4 rooms with small candles
- 4 rooms with medium candles

Now, let's calculate the total number of candles:

- Small candles: 4 rooms * 4 candles per room = 16 small candles
- Medium candles: 4 rooms * 5 candles per room = 20 medium candles
- Total candles: 16 + 20 = 36 candles

Next, let's calculate the total number of flashlights:

- Each person has a flashlight, and there are 4 people, so there are 4 flashlights.
- There are 2 flashlights per room, and there are 8 rooms, so there are 8 * 2 = 16 flashlights.
- Total flashlights: 4 (for people) + 16 (for rooms) = 20 flashlights

Now, we can find the total number of candles and flashlights used by Brianna's family:

- Total candles: 36
- Total flashlights: 20

36 + 20 = 56"
"To find out how many chips each person gets, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of family members. 

First, we need to find the total number of chips. There are 2 bags of chips with 55 chips each, so the total number of chips is 2 x 55 = 110.

Now, we divide the total number of chips by the number of family members: 110 / 5 = 22.

So, each person gets 22 chips."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes to get to each side of the Rubik's cube.

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each.
- The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time it takes to get to each side:

5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

So, it takes 30 minutes to get all 6 sides of the Rubik's cube.

"To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to know the number of robots. 

Since there are half as many robots as helmets, and there are 20 helmets, we can calculate the number of robots as follows:

Number of robots = Number of helmets / 2
Number of robots = 20 / 2
Number of robots = 10

Now, we know the number of robots and helmets. Since there are half as many helmets as footballs, we can calculate the number of footballs as follows:

Number of footballs = Number of helmets * 2
Number of footballs = 20 * 2
Number of footballs = 40

Now, we have the number of robots, helmets, and footballs. To find the total number of items, we add them together:

Total number of items = Number of robots + Number of helmets + Number of footballs
Total number of items = 10 + 20 + 40
Total number of items = 70

"To find out how many calls Tim deals with in a day, we need to divide the number of hours he works by the time it takes to deal with a call. 

First, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 6 hours is 6 x 60 = 360 minutes. 

Now, we divide the total minutes by the time it takes to deal with a call, which is 15 minutes. 360 / 15 = 24 calls per day.

Since Tim works 5 days a week, we multiply the number of calls per day by 5. 24 x 5 = 120 calls per week.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish to dry on 6 paintings with the new varnish, we need to first find out how long it would take with the old varnish. 

Since it takes 7 minutes for the old varnish to dry on one painting, it will take 7 * 6 = 42 minutes for 6 paintings with the old varnish.

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings. Since it takes 12 minutes for the new varnish to dry on one painting, it will take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes for 6 paintings with the new varnish.

To find out how much longer it will take, we subtract the time it takes with the old varnish from the time it takes with the new varnish: 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

The coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry than it would with the old varnish.

"To find out how many cups of water Crista needs, we need to calculate the total amount of water for each group of plants and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the water needed for the 4 plants that need half a cup of water. 
4 plants * 0.5 cups = 2 cups

Next, let's calculate the water needed for the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water. 
8 plants * 1 cup = 8 cups

Now, let's calculate the water needed for the remaining plants. Crista has 20 plants in total, and we've already accounted for 4 + 8 = 12 plants. 
20 - 12 = 8 plants

Since these 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water, 
8 plants * 0.25 cups = 2 cups

Now, let's add up the water needed for all the plants. 
2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups

Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total distance Phineas needs to cover. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance is 200 yards. 

Since half of the distance is on land, Phineas will need to cover 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water. 

Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute on land, so it will take him 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes to cover the land part.

Phineas swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute in water, so it will take him 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes to cover the water part.

To find the total time, we need to add the time it takes to cover the land part and the water part. Total time = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes.

The final answer is 15."
"To find out how many boxes of popsicles Bob needs, we need to divide the total number of sticks he needs by the number of sticks per box.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped. 
In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount popped, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increased to four times the initial rate, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.
In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate decreased to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 80 / 2 = 40 kernels popped.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels.

A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped after Garrett took the pan off the heat. That's 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

So, the total number of kernels that popped is 200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2 * (long side + short side)

In this case, the long side is 20 feet and the short side is 15 feet. 

Perimeter = 2 * (20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2 * 35
Perimeter = 70

So, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper."
"To find the average of their ages, we need to add their ages and divide by 2. 

Mia's age is 40 years. Since Emma is 16 years older than Mia, Emma's age is 40 + 16 = 56 years.

The sum of their ages is 40 + 56 = 96 years.

To find the average, we divide the sum by 2: 96 / 2 = 48.

The average of their ages is 48."
"To find the total number of good seashells, we need to subtract the number of cracked seashells from the total number of seashells found.

First, let's add up the total number of seashells found: 
Tom found 214 seashells, Nancy found 432 seashells, and Benny found 86 seashells. 
214 + 432 + 86 = 732

Now, let's subtract the number of cracked seashells: 
732 - 67 = 665

So, they found 665 good seashells together."
"To find the total cost of the place settings, we need to calculate the cost of each type of plate and then add them together.

For the dinner plates, there are 12 people, and each dinner plate costs $6.00. 
12 * $6.00 = $72.00

For the salad plates, there are 12 people, and each salad plate costs $4.00. 
12 * $4.00 = $48.00

For the bowls, there are 12 people, and each bowl costs $5.00. 
12 * $5.00 = $60.00

Now, let's add the costs of all the plates together. 
$72.00 + $48.00 + $60.00 = $180.00

Avery will spend $180.00 on place settings."
"To find out how long it took Anna to finish the puzzle, we need to first find out how long it took Steve to finish it. Steve took 10 hours to complete the puzzle.

Since Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time, we need to find half of Steve's time first. Half of 10 hours is 10 / 2 = 5 hours.

Now, we add 2 hours to that half. 5 hours + 2 hours = 7 hours.

So, it took Anna 7 hours to finish the puzzle.

"To find out how much feed Dexter has left, we need to calculate how much feed he uses in a day and then multiply it by 7.

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so each pig eats 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of feed per day.

Dexter has 5 pigs, so the total feed used per day is 8 * 5 = 40 pounds.

In a week, Dexter uses 40 * 7 = 280 pounds of feed.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so he has 300 - 280 = 20 pounds of feed left.

"To find out how many hot dogs John needs, we need to calculate the total number of hot dogs needed for the party. 

He invited 20 people, and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs. So, the total number of hot dogs needed is 20 * 2 = 40 hot dogs.

John already has 4 hot dogs left over, so we need to add those to the total. 40 + 4 = 44 hot dogs.

Since a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs, we need to divide 44 by 6 to find out how many packs John needs to buy. 44 / 6 = 7.33. Since we can't buy a fraction of a pack, John needs to buy 8 packs of hot dogs.

Each pack costs $2, so John needs to spend 8 * 2 = $16 on hot dogs.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Frances has left, we need to calculate her total income and total expenses.

First, let's calculate her total income from selling cupcakes:
20 cupcakes * $2 per cupcake = $40

Then, let's calculate her total income from selling cookies:
40 cookies * $1 per cookie = $40

Her total income is $40 + $40 = $80

Now, let's calculate her total expenses for buying trays:
5 trays * $4 per tray = $20

Now, let's subtract her total expenses from her total income:
$80 - $20 = $60

Frances has $60 left."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 5 children.

On the first street, 5 children join, so now there are 5 + 5 = 10 children.

On the second street, each of the 10 children is joined by another child, so now there are 10 + 10 = 20 children.

On the third street, each of the 20 children is joined by 2 children, so now there are 20 + 20 * 2 = 20 + 40 = 60 children.

The original 5 children then leave the group, so we subtract them from the total, 60 - 5 = 55 children.

The answer is 55."
"To find out how many meals Mamou has left, we need to add the meals she gave out on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, and then subtract that from the total number of meals she had.

First, let's add the meals she gave out: 64 + 30 + 48 = 142 meals.

Now, let's subtract the meals she gave out from the total number of meals: 1360 - 142 = 1218.

So, Mamou has 1218 meals left to distribute."

James has 105 cents."
"To find the total age of all the siblings, we need to find the age of the older brother first. 

Since one brother is 12 years old and that's half the age of the older brother, the older brother must be 12 * 2 = 24 years old.

Now, we know the ages of all the siblings: 
- 2 brothers: 12 and 24 years old
- 3 sisters: 16 years old each

Total age of the brothers: 12 + 24 = 36 years
Total age of the sisters: 3 * 16 = 48 years
Total age of all siblings: 36 + 48 = 84 years

"To find the total time Charisma spent on meditation and yoga, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity separately and then add them together.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so that's 15 * 2 = 30 minutes per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, she meditates 30 * 7 = 210 minutes per week. 

She practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) 5 days a week, so that's 60 * 5 = 300 minutes per week.

In 4 weeks, she meditates 210 * 4 = 840 minutes and practices yoga 300 * 4 = 1200 minutes.

The total time spent on meditation and yoga is 840 + 1200 = 2040 minutes.

"To find out how many pens Sarah has, we need to first find out how many pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we multiply 18 by 3.

18 * 3 = 54

Now that we know Timothy has 54 pens, we can find out how many pens Sarah has. Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we divide 54 by 2.

54 / 2 = 27

So, Sarah has 27 pens.

"To find Jackie's height before summer, we need to work backwards. 

We know Albert is 36"" tall. Since Anne is twice the size of Albert, Anne is 2 x 36"" = 72"". 

Since Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, Jackie is 72"" - 2"" = 70"". 

Now, we know Jackie grew 3"" over the summer. To find her height before summer, we need to subtract 3"" from her current height. 

So, Jackie's height before summer was 70"" - 3"" = 67""."
"To find out how much money the company will receive for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks and then multiply it by the price per bar.

Since the company produces 5000 bars in one day, in two weeks (14 days), it will produce 5000 * 14 = 70,000 bars.

The price per bar is $2, so the total amount of money the company will receive is 70,000 * 2 = $140,000.

"To find the total amount of money Jake spends, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts, and the original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since it's a buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake pays full price for the first T-shirt and 50% off for the second T-shirt. 

The cost of the first T-shirt is $8. 
The cost of the second T-shirt is $8 * 0.5 = $4. 
The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. 
The cost of the shoes is $40 * 0.6 = $24.

Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends. 
The total amount of money Jake spends is $12 + $24 = $36.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes Nate's dog dug while Nate was away. 

Nate's dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is 6 * 14 = 84.

When Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night. So, the net change in the number of holes per day is 9 - 6 = 3.

To find out how many days it takes to fill in all the holes, we need to divide the total number of holes by the net change in the number of holes per day. 

So, 84 / 3 = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to divide 28 by 7 to find out how many weeks it takes to fill in all the holes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Let's say the number of test tubes Igor gathered is x. Since he gathered half as many test tubes as requested, the number of test tubes he gathered is 16 / 2 = 8.

He gathered 2 more Petri dishes than requested, so the number of Petri dishes he gathered is 14 + 2 = 16.

The number of beakers he gathered is the same as the number requested, which is 7.

The total number of items he gathered is x + 8 + 16 + 7 = x + 31.

However, the total number of items he placed on the lab bench is 29. So, we can set up the equation x + 31 = 29.

Solving for x, we get x = 29 - 31 = -2. Since the number of test tubes cannot be negative, this is not a valid solution.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. 

If Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, he gathered 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes. 

He gathered 2 more Petri dishes than requested, so the number of Petri dishes he gathered is 14 + 2 = 16.

The number of beakers he gathered is the same as the number requested, which is 7.

The total number of items he gathered is 8 + 16 + 7 = 31.

"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to first find the total cost of all the watermelons and then calculate the selling price.

The total cost of 50 watermelons is $80. 

Since the profit is 25%, we can find the cost price of one watermelon by dividing the total cost by 50 and then multiplying by 100 to get 100% of the cost price.

Cost price of one watermelon = (Total cost / 50) * 100
= (80 / 50) * 100

Now, we can find the selling price of one watermelon by adding 25% of the cost price to the cost price.

Selling price of one watermelon = Cost price + (Cost price * 25%)
