"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first calculate the total number of eggs she lays and then subtract the eggs she eats and bakes.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.

She bakes 4 muffins with 4 eggs each, so she uses 4 * 4 = 16 eggs for baking. However, she only has 13 eggs left, which is not enough for baking. This means she can only bake 13 / 4 = 3.25 muffins (we'll round down to 3 muffins since you can't bake a fraction of a muffin).

Now, let's calculate the number of eggs she has left after baking: 13 - 3 = 10 eggs.

She sells the remaining 10 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. So, she makes 10 * 2 = $20 per day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $20"
"To find the total number of bolts needed, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fibers separately and then add them together.

The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 
It takes half that much white fiber, which is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt.

So, the total number of bolts needed is 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

"To find the profit, we need to calculate the original value of the house after the repairs, and then subtract the cost of the repairs.

The original value of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%, so the new value is:

$80,000 + (150% of $80,000) = $80,000 + (1.5 * $80,000) = $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

The cost of the repairs was $50,000. To find the profit, we subtract the cost of the repairs from the new value:

$200,000 - $50,000 = $150,000

So, Josh made a profit of $150,000.

"To find the total meters James runs per week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs per sprint and then multiply it by the number of sprints he runs per week.

Since James runs 60 meters per sprint, and he runs 3 sprints per week, the total meters he runs per week is:

60 meters/sprint * 3 sprints/week = 180 meters/week

The final answer is: 180"
"To determine the total amount of feed Wendi needs for her chickens, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she has already given them. 

In the morning, she gave 15 cups of feed to 20 chickens. 
In the afternoon, she gave 25 cups of feed to 20 chickens.

Total feed given so far = (15 cups * 20 chickens) + (25 cups * 20 chickens)
Total feed given so far = 300 cups + 500 cups
Total feed given so far = 800 cups

Since Wendi gives her chickens three meals a day, and she has already given them two meals, we need to find out how much feed she needs for the final meal.

Total feed needed for the day = Total feed given so far + Feed needed for the final meal
Total feed needed for the day = 800 cups + x

Since Wendi gives 3 cups of feed to each chicken per meal, and there are 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed for the final meal is:
Feed needed for the final meal = 3 cups * 20 chickens
Feed needed for the final meal = 60 cups

Now we can substitute this value into the equation:
Total feed needed for the day = 800 cups + 60 cups
Total feed needed for the day = 860 cups

The final answer is: 860"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The cost of the first glass is $5.

The cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

The cost of 15 glasses is 15 * $3 = $45.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses: $5 + $45 = $50.

The final answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of sheep in Charleston and Toulouse. 

Since Seattle has 20 sheep, and Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we can find the total number of sheep by adding the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle: 160 + 80 + 20 = 260.

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where Carla downloads 60% of the file, and the second part where she downloads the remaining 40% of the file.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download 60% of the file:

60% of 200 GB = 0.6 * 200 GB = 120 GB
Time to download 120 GB = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

Now, let's add the time it takes to restart the download:

Total time so far = 60 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes

Next, Carla has to download the remaining 40% of the file:

40% of 200 GB = 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB
Time to download 80 GB = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

Now, let's add the time it takes to download the remaining 40% of the file:

Total time = 80 minutes + 40 minutes = 120 minutes

Therefore, it takes Carla 120 minutes to download the 200 GB file.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts. 

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. Distance = speed * time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

Then, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move. 

Next, he drives for half an hour at 30 mph. Distance = speed * time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.

Finally, he drives for the remaining 2 hours at 80 mph. Distance = speed * time = 80 * 2 = 160 miles.

The total distance covered is 180 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles.

Since John initially drove 180 miles away from home, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is 355 - 180 = 175 miles.

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and then add the earnings for the overtime hours.

Her regular hourly rate is $10, so for the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, so her overtime rate is:
$10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour

Her earnings for the overtime hours are:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Now, we add her earnings for the regular hours and the overtime hours:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which equals 54. 

Now, subtract 54 from 180 to find the downloads in the third month: 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads for each month: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 * $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 * $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year.

Initial cost of the tree: $90
Annual revenue from lemons: 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.5/year
Annual cost of maintenance: $3/year

Net profit per year: $10.5 (revenue) - $3 (cost) = $7.5

Since the initial cost of the tree is $90, we need to subtract this from the net profit to find the break-even point.

$7.5 (net profit) - $90 (initial cost) = -$82.5 (loss in the first year)

However, this means that in the first year, Carlos will incur a loss. We need to continue calculating the net profit for subsequent years until we reach a positive net profit.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as 'x'. 

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she has (2/3)x vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she has (2/3)x - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Next, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she has (1/2)((2/3)x - 2) vacuum cleaners left.

We are given that she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:

(1/2)((2/3)x - 2) = 5

To solve for x, we can start by multiplying both sides by 2:

(2/3)x - 2 = 10

Next, we add 2 to both sides:

(2/3)x = 12

To isolate x, we multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 18

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students
Number of students remaining = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the merchant's best choice, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option.

For the jewelry option:
Initial cost: $5,000
Market increase: 2.5%
Potential selling price: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,250
Profit: $5,250 - $5,000 = $250

For the electronic gadgets option:
Initial cost: $8,000
Market increase: 1.2%
Potential selling price: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,160
Profit: $8,160 - $8,000 = $160

Since the profit from the jewelry option ($250) is greater than the profit from the electronic gadgets option ($160), the merchant should choose the jewelry option to maximize profit.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered by each train on the first day and the distance covered by each train on the second day.

On the first day, both trains travel westward for 80 miles. Since they are traveling in the same direction, we can consider them as having covered the same distance on the westward journey.

On the second day, both trains travel northward for 150 miles. This distance is not related to their previous westward journey, so we can add it to their individual distances.

To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to know the initial distance between them. However, the problem doesn't provide this information. Let's assume the initial distance between the trains is 'x' miles.

The total distance covered by each train on the first day is 80 miles.

The total distance covered by each train on the second day is 150 miles.

Since they are traveling in the same direction, we can add the distances covered on the second day to the initial distance 'x'. However, without knowing the initial distance 'x', we cannot determine the exact distance covered by each train.

But if we assume the initial distance 'x' is 0, then the total distance covered by each train is:

Day 1: 80 miles
Day 2: 150 miles
Total distance = 80 + 150 = 230 miles

If the initial distance 'x' is not 0, we cannot provide a numerical answer.

Since the question asks for a numerical answer, we will assume the initial distance 'x' is 0.

The distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her annual earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- There are 50 weeks in a year.
- Annual earnings from teaching = 35 hours/week * $20/hour * 50 weeks/year = $35,000

Next, let's calculate her annual earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- There are 50 weeks in a year.
- Annual earnings from coaching = 15 hours/week * $30/hour * 50 weeks/year = $22,500

Now, let's add her annual earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
- Total annual salary = Annual earnings from teaching + Annual earnings from coaching
- Total annual salary = $35,000 + $22,500
- Total annual salary = $57,500

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks and then convert that to dozens.

Since Claire makes 3 eggs every morning, in one day she eats 3 eggs. In 4 weeks, she will eat 3 eggs/day * 28 days (in a month) * 4 weeks = 3 * 28 * 4 = 336 eggs.

Since 1 dozen = 12 eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she eats in 4 weeks. 

336 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 28 dozens.

The final answer is 28."
"To find the required speed for the remaining distance, we first need to calculate the total distance Marissa has already covered. She walked 4 miles and then 2 miles, so the total distance covered is 4 + 2 = 6 miles.

Since Marissa wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we can calculate the total time she needs to cover the entire distance. 

Time = Total Distance / Average Speed
Time = 12 miles / 4 mph
Time = 3 hours

We know Marissa has already spent 1 hour walking the first 4 miles and another hour walking the next 2 miles. So, the remaining time she needs to cover the remaining distance is 3 - 1 - 1 = 1 hour.

Now, we can calculate the required speed for the remaining distance.

Required Speed = Total Distance / Remaining Time
Required Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Required Speed = 6 mph

The final answer is 6."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink separately, then add them together and subtract the spilled amount.

The orange drink is two-thirds water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the water from both drinks: 20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = 29/3 liters.

However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract that from the total: 29/3 - 1 = 29/3 - 3/3 = 26/3 liters.

To convert this to a decimal, we can divide the numerator by the denominator: 26/3 ≈ 8.67 liters.

The final answer is 8.67."
"To find the answer, we need to determine the age of Raymond when his son was born. 

Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is now 31, we can calculate Raymond's current age as follows: 
31 - 6 = 25

Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find the age difference between Raymond and his son, we subtract the son's age from Raymond's age: 
25 - 23 = 2

So, Raymond's son is 2 years younger than Raymond. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we subtract the son's age from Raymond's age: 
25 - 2 = 23

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 23 years ago.

"To find the total number of DVDs sold, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to each group of customers and then add them together.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought 3 DVDs in total.
The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs in total.
The last 3 customers bought 0 DVDs each, so they bought 0 DVDs in total.

Now, let's add the DVDs sold to each group: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the original price as 'x'. 

Since Kyle bought the book with a 25% discount, the amount he paid is 75% of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%). 

We know that the amount Kyle paid is $19.50. So, we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To find the original price 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she has already ordered.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the remaining amount she spent on pizza is $50 - $33 = $17.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes she ordered, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of each box:

$17 / $8.50 = 2.

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

"To find the total amount Mishka spent, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing and then add them together.

The cost of 3 pairs of shorts is 3 * $16.50 = $49.50.
The cost of 3 pairs of pants is 3 * $22.50 = $67.50.
The cost of 3 pairs of shoes is 3 * $42 = $126.

Now, let's add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items."
"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of servings she consumes and then multiply it by the cost per serving.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she consumes 1 serving per day. In 60 days, she will consume 60 servings.

Each carton contains 15 servings, so the number of cartons she needs to buy is 60 / 15 = 4.

The cost of each carton is $4.00, so the total cost will be 4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00.

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to determine the total distance he traveled before his second stop and then subtract the distance he traveled after his second stop.

Henry traveled 20 miles before his first stop. 

The total distance of the trip is 60 miles. Since his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, he traveled 60 - 15 = 45 miles after his second stop.

Now, we can find the distance between his first and second stops by subtracting the distance traveled before the first stop from the total distance traveled before the second stop: 20 + 45 = 65 miles.

However, this is the total distance before the second stop. To find the distance between the first and second stops, we need to subtract the distance traveled before the first stop from the total distance before the second stop: 45 - 20 = 25 miles.

The final answer is: 25"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the cost of the boots as B. We know that the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. 

Since one pair of heels costs $33, the other pair costs twice as much, which is 2 * 33 = $66. 

The total cost of the two pairs of heels is 33 + 66 = $99. 

Since the two pairs of heels cost five dollars less than the boots, we can set up the equation: B - 5 = 99. 

Solving for B, we get B = 99 + 5 = $104.

The boots cost $104."
"To solve this problem, we can start by representing Darrell's and Allen's current ages as 7x and 11x, respectively, where x is a constant multiplier.

We know that their total age now is 162, so we can set up the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms:

18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age by multiplying 11x:

Allen's current age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is: 109"
"To find the average guess, we need to first calculate the number of guesses made by each person.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.

The second person guesses 20 more than half of the first person's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 60.

The third person guesses 25% more than the first person's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and 20 more than that is 100.

Now, we have the following guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add these numbers together and divide by 3 (the number of guesses).

80 + 60 + 100 = 240

240 / 3 = 80

The average guess is 80."
"To find the total hours spent taking care of dogs per day, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time spent on each dog per day.

10 dogs * 0.5 hours/dog = 5 hours/day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily hours by 7 to find the total hours spent per week.

5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

The final answer is: 35"
"To find the number of gold coins Gretchen has, we need to first determine the number of silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is 'x + 30'. 

We know that the total number of coins is 110. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 30) = 110.

Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 110.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

Since x represents the number of silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70.

The final answer is 70."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, we know that Raymond has 40 jewels.

Since Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, we need to find half of Raymond's jewels first. 
Half of Raymond's jewels = 40 / 2 = 20 jewels.

Now, we know Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. 
Aaron's jewels = 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Since Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, 
Siobhan's jewels = 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

"To find the total points scored, we need to calculate the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the points scored in the second 20 minutes.

Points scored in the first 20 minutes = 4
Points scored in the second 20 minutes = 4 + (25% of 4)
To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25
25% of 4 = 4 * 0.25 = 1
Points scored in the second 20 minutes = 4 + 1 = 5

Total points scored = Points scored in the first 20 minutes + Points scored in the second 20 minutes
Total points scored = 4 + 5
Total points scored = 9

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of yogurts he eats in 30 days and then multiply it by the cost per yogurt.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The sale price of 4 yogurts is $5.00, so the cost of one yogurt is $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.

Now, we multiply the total number of yogurts by the cost per yogurt: 60 yogurts * $1.25 = $75.00.

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"To find out how many Lego sets John still has, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has after selling the Lego sets and then subtract the cost of the video games.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money John has after selling the Lego sets:
13 Lego sets * $15 per set = $195

He then buys 8 video games for $20 each, so the total cost of the video games is:
8 video games * $20 per game = $160

Now, let's subtract the cost of the video games from the total amount of money John has:
$195 - $160 = $35

Since John has $5 left after buying the video games, we can set up an equation to find out how much money he had initially:
Initial amount - $160 (cost of video games) = $35 (amount left)
Initial amount = $35 + $160
Initial amount = $195

Now, we know John initially had $195. To find out how many Lego sets he sold, we can divide the initial amount by the price per Lego set:
$195 / $15 per set = 13 sets

However, John initially had 13 Lego sets, and he sold them. So, he still has 0 Lego sets left.

The final answer is 0."
"To find John's average running speed, we need to first calculate the total distance he runs in a week and the total time he spends running.

Distance run per day:
- Day 1: 3 hours
- Day 2: 3/2 = 1.5 hours
- Day 3: 1.5 hours

Total distance run per week: 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 miles

Since John runs 3 days a week, we can calculate his average speed as follows:

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
= 6 miles / 3 hours
= 2 miles per hour

The final answer is 2."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running speed and walking speed. 

Since Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and her skipping speed is half of her running speed, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since she spends 6 hours in total, she spends 6 / 3 = 2 hours running and 6 / 3 = 2 hours walking.

The distance she travels while running is her running speed multiplied by the time she spends running, which is 6 * 2 = 12 miles.

The distance she travels while walking is her walking speed multiplied by the time she spends walking, which is 3 * 2 = 6 miles.

The total distance she travels is the sum of the distances she travels while running and walking, which is 12 + 6 = 18 miles.

The final answer is: 18"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the age of Brandon's iPhone in relation to Suzy's iPhone. 

Since Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, we can calculate Ben's iPhone age as follows: 
Ben's iPhone = 2 * Suzy's iPhone = 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

Now, since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, we can calculate Brandon's iPhone age as follows: 
Brandon's iPhone = 4 * Ben's iPhone = 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone. 

When Polly throws the javelin without the gemstone, she can throw it 400 feet. 

When Polly throws the javelin with the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther than without the gemstone. 

So, the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone is 3 * 400 = 1200 feet.

Since the dragon's flames can reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin."
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces initially set out.

Total number of pieces initially set out = 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces
Number of pieces remaining = 14

Number of pieces taken by the guests = Total number of pieces initially set out - Number of pieces remaining
= 40 - 14

The guests took 26 pieces of pie."
"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to first calculate the total calories available for consumption. 

You have already consumed 1800 calories, so you have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left.

Since each serving has 250 calories, we can find the number of servings you can have with 200 calories by dividing 200 by 250. 

200 / 250 = 0.8 servings

Since each serving is 5 grams, we multiply 0.8 servings by 5 grams per serving to find the total grams you can eat.

0.8 * 5 = 4 grams

So, you can eat 4 grams of chips."
"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles. 

Total revenue = Number of candles * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total revenue = $40.00

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks for each candle, and he makes 20 candles. 

Total cost = Number of candles * (Beeswax + Wicks)
Total cost = 20 * ($10.00)
Total cost = $200.00

Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $200.00
Net profit = -$160.00

The negative sign indicates that Charlie is operating at a loss."
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply that by the average time it takes to write an article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is 5 * (2/5) = 2 more articles. So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles written:
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice used at work. Since she placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee, she used 220 Post-it notes at work.

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. After using 220 at work, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining. 

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased as 'x'. 

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

80 + x - 220 = 23

Simplifying the equation:

x - 140 = 23

x = 23 + 140

x = 163

Therefore, the package she purchased contained 163 Post-it notes."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many blue ties John bought. We know that he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. 

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is 2 times the number of blue ties.
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
= 10

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie. 
Cost of each red tie = $40 + (50% of $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches and then divide it by the length of each piece.

There are 12 inches in 1 foot. So, 4 feet is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches):

48 ÷ 6 = 8

Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units, we first need to find the total number of units in the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 units, the total number of units is 15 * 8 = 120.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is 3/4 * 120 = 90.

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units: 120 - 90 = 30.

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs sold per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs are sold per week. There are 7 days in a week, and his chickens produce 252 eggs per day. 

252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Since eggs are sold by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen.

1764 eggs/week ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen/week

Now, we can multiply the number of dozens sold per week by the price per dozen to find out how much Lloyd makes per week.

147 dozen/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

The final answer is: $294"
"To find the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to first find the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since he is traveling at 10 mph, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Time = 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM)
Distance = 10 * 3 = 30 miles

Now, we need to find the time it takes to travel back at 6 mph. We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many pounds Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he is removing. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

30 * 1/4 = 30 * 0.25 = 7.5 pounds

Since Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total, we subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight he needs to remove:

15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Now, we need to find out how many toys he needs to remove to make up for the remaining weight. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can divide the remaining weight by the weight of a single toy:

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

"To determine which day had the higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The total revenue for Thursday is:
6 * $60 (truck tires) + 4 * $40 (car tires) = $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and 0 truck tires. The total revenue for Friday is:
12 * $40 (car tires) = $480

Since $520 is greater than $480, the mechanic earned more revenue on Thursday.

The difference in revenue between the two days is:
$520 - $480 = $40

"To find the total number of kittens, we need to first determine the number of kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, we can calculate Patchy's kittens as 3 * 12 = 36.

Now, we add the number of kittens Patchy had to the number of kittens Trixie had. The total number of kittens is 36 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 48.

The Doubtfire family now has 48 kittens."
"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to first determine how many lollipops are left after Jean eats 2. 

Jean started with 30 lollipops and ate 2, so the number of lollipops left is 30 - 2 = 28.

Since Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag, we can divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to find out how many bags can be filled.

28 ÷ 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

Weight of the bridge = 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck = 3755 pounds
Weight of a single box = 15 pounds

Maximum weight available for boxes = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15
Maximum number of boxes = 83

The maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83."
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to calculate the total amount of the extra fees first. 

The 25% fee is 25% of $40.00, which is 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00. 

Adding the delivery fee of $3.00, the total extra fees become $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00.

Now, we add the total extra fees to the original bill: $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00.

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip to get the final price: $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to calculate the number of raspberries in the clusters and add it to the number of individual raspberries.

There are 6 clusters with 20 raspberries each, so the total number of raspberries in the clusters is 6 * 20 = 120.

The total number of raspberries is 187."
"To find the number of good oranges, we first need to determine the total number of oranges that are not good. 

We know that 1 orange is bad, 20% are unripe, and 2 are sour. 

First, let's calculate the number of unripe oranges: 
20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges

Now, we add the number of bad and sour oranges to the unripe ones: 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges that are not good

To find the number of good oranges, we subtract the number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges: 
25 (total) - 8 (not good) = 17 oranges

The number of good oranges is 17."
"To find the total amount Janet paid, we need to calculate the cost of the material, the cost of construction, and the insurance.

The cost of the material is $500.
The cost of construction is $800.
The insurance cost is 10% of the total cost of the material and construction, which is 10% of ($500 + $800) = 10% of $1300 = 0.1 * $1300 = $130.

Now, we add the costs together: $500 (material) + $800 (construction) + $130 (insurance) = $1430.

"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 20 years and the remaining 10 years.

For the first 20 years, her annual pension is $50,000.

For the remaining 10 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. Since the pension value increases by 5% each year, we can calculate the pension value for the remaining years as follows:

Year 21: 50,000 * 1.05 = $52,500
Year 22: 52,500 * 1.05 = $55,125
Year 23: 55,125 * 1.05 = $57,763.75
Year 24: 57,763.75 * 1.05 = $60,503.19
Year 25: 60,503.19 * 1.05 = $63,362.20
Year 26: 63,362.20 * 1.05 = $66,287.21
Year 27: 66,287.21 * 1.05 = $69,251.62
Year 28: 69,251.62 * 1.05 = $72,261.86
Year 29: 72,261.86 * 1.05 = $75,294.59
Year 30: 75,294.59 * 1.05 = $78,394.19

Now, we add the pension for the first 20 years to the pension for the remaining 10 years:

$50,000 + $78,394.19 = $128,394.19

So, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be $128,394.19."
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break down the costs into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid the full amount of $140 per month. Since there are 6 months in the first half of the year, the total cost for the first half is:

$140 * 6 = $840

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charged Aleena 10% less. To find the amount she paid for the second half, we need to calculate 10% of the original amount and subtract it from the original amount.

10% of $140 is $14, so the amount she paid for the second half is:

$140 - $14 = $126

Since there are 6 months in the second half of the year, the total cost for the second half is:

$126 * 6 = $756

Now, we add the costs of the first and second halves to find the total amount Aleena paid for the year:

$840 + $756 = $1596

Therefore, Aleena paid a total of $1596 for the streaming service by the end of the year.

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the total capacity of her tank (12 gallons) by the amount of gas she has already used (4 gallons) and then add the distance she has already traveled (100 miles).

First, let's calculate the remaining capacity of her tank: 
12 gallons (total capacity) - 4 gallons (used) = 8 gallons

Now, we can calculate the total distance she can drive on a single tank:
8 gallons (remaining capacity) * 25 miles per gallon (average miles per gallon) = 200 miles

However, since she has already traveled 100 miles, we need to add that to the total distance:
200 miles + 100 miles = 300 miles

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV each time. He reads for half as long, which is 1 hour. 

So, the total hours spent on TV and reading each time is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent each week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

To find the total hours spent in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly hours by 4: 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total number of people sent by the schools, we need to calculate the number of players and coaches for each team and then multiply by the number of schools.

Each team has 5 players and 1 coach, so the total number of people per team is 5 + 1 = 6.

Since there are 2 teams per school, the total number of people per school is 6 * 2 = 12.

There are 4 schools, so the total number of people sent by all schools is 12 * 4 = 48.

The final answer is 48."
"To find the total number of gems, we need to calculate the number of each type of gemstone.

Let's start with the diamonds. We know there are 175 diamonds.

The number of rubies is 35 fewer than diamonds, so the number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140.

The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so the number of emeralds is 2 * 140 = 280.

Now, we can find the total number of gems by adding the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds: 175 + 140 + 280 = 595.

Therefore, there are 595 gems in the chest.

595"
"To find the number of teachers, we first need to determine the total number of students. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, the number of boys is 2 * 60 = 120.

The total number of students is the sum of boys and girls, which is 120 + 60 = 180.

Since there are 5 students to every teacher, we can divide the total number of students by 5 to find the number of teachers. 

Number of teachers = Total number of students / 5
= 180 / 5
= 36

The final answer is 36."

"To calculate Judy's weekly earnings, we need to first calculate her daily earnings and then multiply it by the number of days in a week.

Judy teaches 5 classes per day on weekdays, which is 5 days (Monday to Friday). She also teaches 8 classes on Saturday. 

Total classes per week = 5 classes/day * 5 days + 8 classes = 25 classes

Each class has 15 students, so the total number of students per week = 25 classes * 15 students/class = 375 students

Judy charges $15 per student, so her weekly earnings = 375 students * $15/student = $5625

The final answer is: $5625"
"To find the total number of instructions, we need to calculate the number of instructions in the second recipe and add it to the number of instructions in the first recipe.

The first recipe has 20 instructions.

"To calculate the total amount Shiela will pay each month, we need to first calculate the total cost of the cell phones and then add the interest.

The total cost of the cell phones is 5 units * $150 per unit = $750.

Since the interest is 2% per unit, the interest for each unit is 2% of $150, which is 0.02 * $150 = $3.

The total interest for all units is 5 units * $3 per unit = $15.

The total amount Shiela will pay each month is the cost of the cell phones plus the interest, which is $750 + $15 = $765.

To find the monthly payment, we divide the total amount by 3 months: $765 / 3 = $255.

So, Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months.

The final answer is: $255."
"To find the total amount Artie will make, we need to calculate the total revenue from each type of flower and then add them together.

"To find the average square footage of each level, we need to first find the total square footage of all levels and then divide it by the number of levels.

The top level has a square footage of 16. Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of the other levels as follows:

Level 1 (top): 16
Level 2: 16 / 2 = 8
Level 3: 8 / 2 = 4
Level 4 (bottom): 4 / 2 = 2

Now, we add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30

There are 4 levels in total. To find the average, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels: 30 / 4 = 7.5

The average square footage of each level is 7.5."
"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food she will use in the first year.

In the first 180 days, she feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, in 180 days, she will use 180 cups of dog food.

After the first 180 days, she feeds the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day. Since there are 365 days in a year, she will use 2 cups/day * 365 days = 730 cups of dog food in the remaining 185 days of the year.

Total dog food used in the first year = 180 cups + 730 cups = 910 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we can divide the total amount of dog food used in the first year by 110 cups/bag to find out how many bags Cecilia will use:

910 cups / 110 cups/bag = 8.27 bags

So, Cecilia will use approximately 9 bags of dog food in the first year.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much laundry each person does. 

Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, and Sarah does 400 pounds, we can set up an equation to find out how much laundry David does. 

Let's denote the amount of laundry David does as 'x'. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can write the equation as 4x = 400. 

Solving for x, we get x = 400 / 4 = 100. 

Now that we know David does 100 pounds of laundry, we can find out how much laundry Raymond does. Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we can write the equation as (1/2) * 400 = 200. 

The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 200 - 100 = 100 pounds.

"To determine the better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in both packages.

For the 3-for-$2.50 package, we can divide 18 by 3 to find out how many packages Vincent needs to buy: 18 / 3 = 6. The total cost would be 6 * $2.50 = $15.

For the 2-for-$1 package, we can divide 18 by 2 to find out how many packages Vincent needs to buy: 18 / 2 = 9. The total cost would be 9 * $1 = $9.

Since $9 is less than $15, Vincent saves $15 - $9 = $6 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

"To find the cost of the grooming after the discount, we need to calculate 30% of the original cost and subtract it from the original cost.

Original cost = $100
Discount = 30% of $100 = 0.3 * $100 = $30

Cost after discount = Original cost - Discount
= $100 - $30
= $70

The grooming cost after the discount is $70."
"To find out how many liters of water were left, we first need to calculate the total amount of water the two girls got. 

Since each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters, we can calculate it as follows:

1/6 * 24 = 4 liters

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they got is 2 * 4 = 8 liters.

Now, we add the 6 liters the boy got to the total amount the girls got:

8 + 6 = 14 liters

So, there were 14 liters of water left.

"To find out how many stickers Charlie has left, we need to calculate the total number of stickers he initially had, then subtract the stickers he gave away and used.

Charlie initially had 10 stickers. He bought 21 stickers, so he had 10 + 21 = 31 stickers.

Then, he got 23 stickers for his birthday, so he had 31 + 23 = 54 stickers.

After giving 9 stickers to his sister, he had 54 - 9 = 45 stickers.

Finally, he used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so he had 45 - 28 = 17 stickers left.

Charlie has 17 stickers left."
"To find Alex's weight, we need to calculate 4 times what Grace weighs and then subtract 2 pounds. 

First, we multiply Grace's weight by 4: 
4 * 125 = 500

Then, we subtract 2 pounds from the result: 
500 - 2 = 498

Now, we add Alex's weight to Grace's weight to find their combined weight: 
125 + 498 = 623

The final answer is: 623"
"To find the total number of thorns, we need to multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush, and then multiply that result by the number of thorns per rose.

Number of rose bushes: 3
Number of roses per bush: 25

Total number of roses: 3 * 25 = 75
Total number of thorns: 75 * 8 = 600

The total number of thorns is 600."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic equation. Let's denote the number of games lost as 'x'. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won can be represented as 'x + 8'. 

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so the sum of the games won and lost is equal to 22. This can be written as:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by adding 8:

x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

Therefore, the football team won 15 games.

"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the number of blocks from each year of vacations Gene has been on. 

Gene started at 23 years old and is now 34, so he has been on vacations for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since he goes on four vacations a year, the number of blocks from each year is 4. 

The total number of blocks is the number of years multiplied by the number of blocks per year, which is 11 * 4 = 44.

The final answer is 44."
"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the duration of each ring and add them up.

The first time, the alarm rang for 4 times. 

The second time, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang for 4 * 3 = 12 times.

The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang for 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, we add up the total number of times the alarm rang: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The alarm rang 22 times in total."
"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate the increase in her salary for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial salary = $600
Increase = 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 1 year = $600 + $60 = $660

Year 2: 
Initial salary = $660
Increase = 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 2 years = $660 + $66 = $726

Year 3: 
Initial salary = $726
Increase = 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Salary after 3 years = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Year 4: 
Initial salary = $798.60
Increase = 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Salary after 4 years = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

Year 5: 
Initial salary = $878.46
Increase = 10% of $878.46 = 0.1 * $878.46 = $87.846
Salary after 5 years = $878.46 + $87.846 = $966.306

Year 6: 
Initial salary = $966.306
Increase = 10% of $966.306 = 0.1 * $966.306 = $96.6306
Salary after 6 years = $966.306 + $96.6306 = $1062.9366

Year 7: 
Initial salary = $1062.9366
Increase = 10% of $1062.9366 = 0.1 * $1062.9366 = $106.29366

"To find out how many copies Harald sold, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as 'x'. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, we can represent the number of copies Marilyn sold as 10x.

The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Marilyn and Harald, which is 88,000. So, we can write the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 8,000

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies."
"To find out how many guests will attend, we need to calculate 3/4 of the total number of invited guests. 

3/4 of 16 is (3/4) * 16 = 12.

The cost of the gift bags is $2 each, so the total cost will be 9 * 2 = $18.

The final answer is 18."
"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount each adult and child will eat, then add those amounts together.

Since an adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child eats half as much, a child will eat 10 / 2 = 5 lbs of potato salad.

There are 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic. The total amount of potato salad needed for the adults is 20 * 10 = 200 lbs. 

The total amount of potato salad needed for the children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amounts for adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic.

"To solve this problem, we need to start with the information about Cindy's pets. Since Cindy has four pets, we can use this as a reference point.

Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

Now, we can add up the number of pets each person has to find the total number of pets: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

The total number of pets the three have is 28."
"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey. 

Since James is 1 year younger than Corey, Corey's age is 10 + 1 = 11 years.

We also know that Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy's age is 11 - 2 = 9 years.

Lastly, Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson's age is 9 - 5 = 4 years.

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how fast Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles. Since Lee used to run 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can set up an equation. Let's denote Gerald's original speed as 'x'. 

Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, Lee's speed can be represented as x + 2. We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. The time it takes to run 400 meters is the distance divided by the speed. So, we can set up the equation:

400 / (x + 2) = 38

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (x + 2):

400 = 38(x + 2)

Expanding the right side of the equation:

400 = 38x + 76

Subtracting 76 from both sides:

324 = 38x

Dividing both sides by 38:

x = 8.42

Now that we know Gerald's original speed, we can calculate his new speed after the diet improvement. Gerald's speed improved by 10%, so his new speed is 110% of his original speed:

New speed = 1.1 * 8.42
New speed = 9.22

Therefore, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in approximately 9.22 seconds."
"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to first find the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, we can multiply the number of dogs by 2 to find the number of cats.

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
= 2 * 60
= 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we need to add the number of dogs and cats and subtract 12.

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 60 + 120
= 180

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
= 180 - 12
= 168

Now, we can find the total number of pets in the neighborhood by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
= 60 + 120 + 168
= 348

"To find out how many hours James slept, we need to calculate 2/3 of the hours Harry slept. 

Harry slept 9 hours, so 2/3 of 9 hours is (2/3) * 9 = 6 hours.

Now, we subtract the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept to find the difference. 

9 hours (Harry's sleep) - 6 hours (James' sleep) = 3 hours.

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to first determine how many ounces of tomatoes she used. Since she lost half of the volume when cooking, the 32 ounces of sauce she made is half of the original volume of the tomatoes.

Let's denote the original volume of the tomatoes as x. Since she lost half of the volume, the amount of sauce she made is half of the original volume, which is x/2 = 32 ounces.

To find the original volume of the tomatoes, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 2 * 32
x = 64 ounces

Since each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes, we can divide the original volume of the tomatoes by 16 to find out how many cans she used:

Number of cans = 64 / 16
Number of cans = 4

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we can multiply the number of cans by 3 to find out how many tomatoes she used:

Total tomatoes = 4 * 3
Total tomatoes = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam. We know that 5 cars took an exit, so the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

We also know that 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes, and the first 15 minutes had an unknown number of cars. Let's call the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes 'x'. 

Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 25, we can set up the equation: x + 20 = 25.

Solving for x, we get x = 25 - 20 = 5.

Therefore, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

First, let's calculate the total number of plants she has: 
18 (new plants) + (2 * 40) (plants on the ledges) = 18 + 80 = 98

Now, she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family. Since there are 40 ledges, she will give away 40 plants.

To find out how many plants she will remain with, we subtract the number of plants given away from the total number of plants:
98 - 40 = 58

Mary will remain with 58 potted plants.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed 1/4 times more than the first friend, which means the second friend pressed 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

Now, let's add the number of doorbell rings for each friend: 
60 (fourth friend) + 70 (third friend) + 25 (second friend) + 20 (first friend) = 175

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Frankie spent watching TV on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. 

On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1 hour each night, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours. 

The total time spent watching TV on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours. 

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday can be found by subtracting the time spent on the other days from the total time. 

7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours. 

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes. 

1.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 90 minutes. 

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we can divide 90 minutes by 30 minutes to find the number of episodes. 

90 / 30 = 3. 

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of a 30-minute show on Wednesday."

Since Henry wants to make twice as many cookies this year, he will bake 2x cookies this year.

However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked this year is 2x + 15.

He drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has left is 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10.

We are given that the number of cookies he has left is 110, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To calculate the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of the gas and then subtract the cashback amount.

The cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon is:
10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

The cashback amount is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons:
10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

Now, subtract the cashback amount from the total cost:
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00."
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups, we need to calculate the total number of roll-ups for each person. 

Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 roll-ups wide * 24 rolls up long = 48 roll-ups
Marcell's roll-ups: 3 roll-ups wide * 14 rolls up long = 42 roll-ups

Since they both ate their entire amount, we add the total number of roll-ups: 48 + 42 = 90 roll-ups

To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups by 2: 90 / 2 = 45

The average number of fruit roll-ups eaten is 45."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the rate at which the boat is taking on water. We know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet it rows. 

Since Julia rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, we can calculate the rate at which she rows as follows:

Rate = Distance / Time = 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second

Now, we can calculate the total time it takes Julia to row to the shore:

Time = Distance / Rate = 64 feet / 1.25 feet/second = 51.2 seconds

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet it rows, we can calculate the total amount of water taken on as follows:

Total water taken on = (2 liters / 10 feet) * Total feet rowed
= (2 liters / 10 feet) * 64 feet
= 12.8 liters

The final answer is: 12.8"
"To find the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to calculate the total number of lessons and then multiply it by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

There are 4 teachers, each having 2 lessons per day. So, the total number of lessons per day is 4 * 2 = 8.

Since the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is 8 * 3 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total number of flowers Ryan has, we need to calculate the total number of flowers he planted and subtract the ones that did not grow.

Ryan plants 2 flowers a day, so in 15 days, he would have planted 2 * 15 = 30 flowers.

However, 5 of those flowers did not grow. To find the total number of flowers that grew, we subtract the ones that did not grow from the total number of flowers planted: 30 - 5 = 25.

So, Ryan has 25 flowers in his garden after 15 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as B and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as D.

We are given that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, so we can write an equation:

6B = 1800

To find the value of B, we divide both sides by 6:

B = 1800 / 6
B = 300

Now, we are given that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. We can write another equation:

B = 50D

Since we already know the value of B, we can substitute it into the equation:

300 = 50D

To find the value of D, we divide both sides by 50:

D = 300 / 50
D = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

The final answer is: 6"
"To calculate Sasha's profit, we need to first calculate the total cost of the lumber and the total revenue from selling it.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $10 per board = $100.

The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $16 per board = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Now, let's calculate the selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards. Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the new price is $10 + (50% of $10) = $10 + $5 = $15 per board. 

The total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $15 per board = $150.

The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 per board. 

The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $16 per board = $80.

The total revenue from selling all the lumber is $150 + $80 = $230.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $230 - $180 = $50.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we need to determine the total number of parts in the ratio. The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, so the total number of parts is 7 + 13 = 20.

Since the total amount of sugar used is 120 teaspoons, we can set up a proportion to find the number of teaspoons of sugar per part:

7 parts = 120 teaspoons
1 part = 120 / 7 = 17.14 teaspoons

Since the ratio of sugar is 7 parts, we multiply 7 by the number of teaspoons per part:

7 * 17.14 = 120.98 teaspoons

So, Katy used approximately 121 teaspoons of sugar.

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to first find the total number of vehicles already present at the port on the first day. 

Since there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles on the second day is 30. To find the number of vehicles added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers added on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by 5: 20 / 5 = 4.

Therefore, 4 containers were imported on the second day."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate Adrien's and Lylah's current salaries and then add them together.

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 30% four years ago, we can calculate his current salary as follows:

Current salary = $40,000 + (30% of $40,000)
= $40,000 + 0.3 * $40,000
= $40,000 + $12,000
= $52,000

Now, we know Adrien's current salary is $52,000. Since his salary increased by 40% four years later, we can calculate his current salary as follows:

Current salary = $52,000 + (40% of $52,000)
= $52,000 + 0.4 * $52,000
= $52,000 + $20,800
= $72,800

Now that we know Adrien's current salary, we can calculate Lylah's current salary. Since Adrien's salary is 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up the following equation:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30%
$72,800 = Lylah's salary + 0.3 * Lylah's salary
$72,800 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $72,800 / 1.3
= $55,769 (approximately)

Now that we know both Adrien's and Lylah's current salaries, we can calculate their total salary four years later:

Total salary = Adrien's salary + Lylah's salary
= $72,800 + $55,769
= $128,569

The final answer is: $128,569"
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he uses in a week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a month.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the number of sheets used per week by 4.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So, the total sheets used per week is 2 * 30 = 60 sheets.

Now, multiply the total sheets used per week by 4 to get the total sheets used per month: 60 * 4 = 240 sheets.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the number of fruits each person brought and then add them together.

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, so the total number of fruits she brought is 5 + 8 = 13.

Kael brought twice the amount of apples, which is 2 * 5 = 10 apples. He also brought half the number of oranges, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges. So, the total number of fruits Kael brought is 10 + 4 = 14.

Now, we add the total number of fruits Morisette and Kael brought together: 13 + 14 = 27.

The total number of fruits they have is 27."
"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate the hours she slept each day.

On Monday, she slept 8 hours.
On Tuesday, she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours.
On Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less than Tuesday, so she slept 6 - 2 = 4 hours.
On Thursday, she slept 1 hour more than Wednesday, so she slept 4 + 1 = 5 hours.
On Friday, she slept 1 hour more than Thursday, so she slept 5 + 1 = 6 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours she slept each day:
8 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 29

The total hours Sadie slept throughout the week is 29."
"To find out how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down her running time into two segments: the first 3 hours and the remaining 4 hours.

In the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour. So, she covers a distance of 3 * 10 = 30 miles.

In the remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour. So, she covers a distance of 4 * 5 = 20 miles.

To find the total distance covered in 7 hours, we add the distances covered in both segments: 30 + 20 = 50 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many letters Jennie put stamps on. Since she put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of letters needing stamps = 60
Number of letters with stamps = 1/3 * 60 = 20

Now, we know that the total number of letters with stamps is 30. To find the initial number of letters with stamps, we can subtract the number of letters with stamps from the total number of letters with stamps:

Initial number of letters with stamps = Total number of letters with stamps - Number of letters with stamps put by Jennie
= 30 - 20
= 10

Therefore, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Julia bought a package of spoons, but the exact number is unknown. Let's call this number 'x'. 

Her husband also bought 5 spoons and gave them to Julia. So, the total number of spoons Julia had initially is x + 5.

Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so the number of spoons she had left after sampling is (x + 5) - 3.

We are told that after setting the table, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. This means that the number of spoons she had left after sampling is equal to 12. 

So, we can set up the equation: (x + 5) - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: x = 10

Therefore, the package that Julia bought initially contained 10 spoons.

"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages. 

First, we know Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. Since he bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, we can calculate the number of fish sausages by adding 6 to the number of chicken sausages. 

Number of fish sausages = 38 (chicken sausages) + 6 = 44

Now, we can find the total number of sausages by adding the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages.

Total number of sausages = 38 (chicken sausages) + 44 (fish sausages) = 82

The final answer is 82."

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to first find the cost of each item.

Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs 15$, a watermelon costs 3 * 15 = 45$.

An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so an orange costs 45 - 5 = 40$.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each item:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * 45 = 180$
- 20 peppers: 20 * 15 = 300$
- 10 oranges: 10 * 40 = 400$

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is 180 + 300 + 400 = 880$."
"To calculate the profit, we need to first calculate the total time spent on patients per day and then the total revenue from patients and the total cost of the doctors' time.

Total time spent on patients per day = 500 patients * 24 minutes per patient = 12,000 minutes
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time to hours:
12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

Total revenue from patients per day = 500 patients * $200 per patient = $100,000
Total cost of doctors' time per day = 200 hours * $150 per hour = $30,000

Profit per day = Total revenue from patients - Total cost of doctors' time
Profit per day = $100,000 - $30,000 = $70,000

The hospital makes $70,000 profit per day."
"To find the number of elves left, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Nissa hires 60 elves.

A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. 
A third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20 elves. 
So, 20 elves quit, leaving 60 - 20 = 40 elves.

Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. 
So, 10 more elves quit, leaving 40 - 10 = 30 elves.

Therefore, there are 30 elves left.

"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the number of tickets used for the roller coaster and the luge rides separately and then add them together.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she used 2 + 2 = 4 rides. Since each ride costs 6 tickets, Pam used 4 * 6 = 24 tickets.

Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he used 4 + 2 = 6 rides. Since each ride costs 6 tickets, Fred used 6 * 6 = 36 tickets.

In total, Pam and Fred used 24 + 36 = 60 tickets that day.

"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees. Let's denote the number of baby bees as B. Then, the number of worker bees is 2B.

We also know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens. Let's denote the number of queens as Q. Then, B = 2Q.

Now, we can substitute B = 2Q into the equation for worker bees: 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700. Since the total number of bees is the sum of worker bees, baby bees, and queens, we can write the equation: 4Q + B + Q = 700.

Substituting B = 2Q into this equation, we get: 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700.

Combine like terms: 7Q = 700.

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100.

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees: B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200.

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees: 2B = 2(200) = 400.

"To calculate the total cost, we need to first find the total cost of the food items and the total cost of the non-food items. 

The total cost of the food items is 2 dollars (milk) + 3 dollars (eggs) = 5 dollars.

The total cost of the non-food items is 3 dollars (light bulbs) + 3 dollars (cups) + 4 dollars (roach traps) = 10 dollars.

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate 10% of 10 dollars, which is 1 dollar. 

The total cost of the non-food items with tax is 10 dollars + 1 dollar = 11 dollars.

The total cost of everything is the sum of the total cost of the food items and the total cost of the non-food items with tax, which is 5 dollars + 11 dollars = 16 dollars.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. 

In the next 6 hours, half of those bees return, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.

So, after the first 12 hours, the total number of bees that have left is 30 + 15 = 45 bees.

In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as the initial 30 leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.

Now, we need to find out how many bees that left before the last 6 hours have returned. Since 15 bees returned in the first 12 hours, and 60 bees left in the last 6 hours, the number of bees that left before the last 6 hours is 60 - 15 = 45 bees.

In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left before that haven't already returned return to the hive. So, the number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is 45 bees.

Therefore, Debra sees 45 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

Time = 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile / 440 feet/minute
Time = 5280 feet / 440 feet/minute
Time = 12 minutes

For Tim:
Time = 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute
Time = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 12 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will be the winner. To find the waiting time, we subtract the time it takes for the winner from the time it takes for the loser:

Waiting time = Time taken by loser - Time taken by winner
Waiting time = 40 minutes - 12 minutes
Waiting time = 28 minutes

The final answer is: 28"
"To calculate the total amount of money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated and multiply it by the cost per tire.

There were 5 bicycles with 2 tires each, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 tires.
There were 3 tricycles with 3 tires each, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 tires.
There was 1 unicycle with 1 tire, so that's 1 tire.

In total, there were 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires inflated.

Each tire costs 25 cents, so the total amount of money made is 20 * 0.25 = 5 dollars.

"To find the total number of cookies Carl bought, we multiply the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack: 10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies.

The total cost of the cookies is the number of cookies multiplied by the cost per cookie: 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.

Since Carl paid with a $10 bill, we subtract the total cost from the $10 to find the change: $10 - $6 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. The total fries eaten so far are 14 (Dave) + 7 (seagull) = 21 fries.
4. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, so 3 * 3 = 9 fries were eaten by the pigeons.
5. The total fries eaten so far are 21 (previous) + 9 (pigeons) = 30 fries.
6. The raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is 2/3 * (30 - 2) = 2/3 * 28 = 18.67 fries. Since we can't have a fraction of a fry, we'll round down to 18 fries for simplicity.
7. The total fries eaten so far are 30 (previous) + 18 (raccoon) = 48 fries.
8. The final ant ate 1 fry, leaving 48 - 1 = 47 fries.

However, we know that 5 fries were left behind. This means that the initial number of fries in the pack must be 47 (final) + 5 (left behind) = 52 fries.

The final answer is: 52"
"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the total hours for each type of day and then add them together.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so that's 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 of these days in a week, the total hours for these days is 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 of these days in a week, the total hours for these days is 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week.

Now, we need to find the total hours for the entire semester. There are 16 weeks in a semester, so we multiply the weekly hours by 16. 

9 hours/week * 16 weeks = 144 hours
8 hours/week * 16 weeks = 128 hours

Adding these together, we get 144 + 128 = 272 hours.

The final answer is: 272"
"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit, feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

- Each roll is 4 inches long, which is 4/12 = 1/3 feet long.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long, which is 6/12 = 1/2 feet long.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:
- Total length of rolls: 300 rolls * 1/3 feet/roll = 100 feet
- Total length of croissants: 120 croissants * 1/2 feet/croissant = 60 feet
- Total length of baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet

Now, let's add the total lengths together: 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet.

The total length of the baked goods will be 280 feet."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order, we need to calculate the total monthly demand and then multiply it by 2.

The total monthly demand is the sum of the demand of all the apes: 
- Monkeys: 200 bananas
- Gorillas: 400 bananas
- Baboons: 100 bananas
Total monthly demand = 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas

Since the zookeeper orders every 2 months, we need to multiply the total monthly demand by 2:
Total bananas needed for 2 months = 700 * 2 = 1400 bananas

The final answer is: 1400"
"To determine the winner, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he runs back and forth, he covers the entire length of the field twice, so his total distance is 2 * 100 yards = 200 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, covering the entire length of the field, which is 100 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, covering an additional 60 yards (40 yards to the 40-yard line and 20 yards back). She does this 34 times, so her total additional distance is 60 yards * 34 = 2040 yards. Her total distance is 100 yards + 2040 yards = 2140 yards.

Since Blake ran 200 yards and Kelly ran 2140 yards, Kelly is the winner. To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance: 2140 yards - 200 yards = 1940 yards.

The winner, Kelly, ran 1940 yards farther than the loser, Blake."
"To find the total amount Raphael spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 4 pens is 4 x $1.5 = $6.
The cost of 2 notebooks is 2 x $4 = $8.

Now, let's add the costs together: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

Raphael spent $34 on everything."
"To find the number of tadpoles Finn can see, we need to subtract the number of tadpoles that hid from the total number of tadpoles initially.

Initially, Finn saw 11 tadpoles.
6 tadpoles came out of hiding, so we add them to the initial count: 11 + 6 = 17
Then, 2 tadpoles hid under a rock, so we subtract them from the count: 17 - 2 = 15

Finn can see 15 tadpoles in the pond now.

"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow the given information step by step.

On Monday, the tank had a depth of 17 feet.

On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find this, we multiply the depth on Tuesday by 2/3.

Depth on Wednesday = (2/3) * 24
Depth on Wednesday = 16 feet

The final answer is 16."
"To find the total number of fish caught, we need to calculate the number of fish each person caught and then add them together.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
Anakin's total: 10 (starfish) + 6 (sea horses) + 3 (clownfish) = 19
Locsin's total: 5 (starfish) + 3 (sea horses) + 5 (clownfish) = 13

Total number of fish caught: 19 (Anakin) + 13 (Locsin) = 32

"To calculate the price after 36 months, we need to apply the 20% increase every two months. 

First, we'll calculate the price after 2 months: 
Original price = $20
Increase = 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4
Price after 2 months = $20 + $4 = $24

Next, we'll calculate the price after 4 months: 
Original price = $24
Increase = 20% of $24 = 0.20 * $24 = $4.80
Price after 4 months = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80

We can see a pattern here. The increase is doubling every two months. 
So, we can calculate the price after 6 months: 
Original price = $28.80
Increase = 20% of $28.80 = 0.20 * $28.80 = $5.76
Price after 6 months = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56

Continuing this pattern, we can calculate the price after 8 months: 
Original price = $34.56
Increase = 20% of $34.56 = 0.20 * $34.56 = $6.912
Price after 8 months = $34.56 + $6.912 = $41.472

We can see that the price is increasing by 20% of the previous price every two months. To find the price after 36 months, we can continue this pattern until we reach 36 months.

Price after 10 months = $41.472 + 20% of $41.472 = $49.6944
Price after 12 months = $49.6944 + 20% of $49.6944 = $59.94888
Price after 14 months = $59.94888 + 20% of $59.94888 = $72.18976
Price after 16 months = $72.18976 + 20% of $72.18976 = $86.53752
Price after 18 months = $86.53752 + 20% of $86.53752 = $103.07504
Price after 20 months = $103.07504 + 20% of $103.07504 = $123.215008
Price after 22 months = $123.215008 + 20% of $123.215008 = $147.643016
Price after 24 months = $147.643016 + 20% of $147.643016 = $177.088032
Price after 26 months = $177.088032 + 20% of $177.088032 = $212.5776064
Price after 28 months = $212.5776064 + 20% of $212.5776064 = $254.1555128
Price after 30 months = $254.1555128 + 20% of $254.1555128 = $303.3105264
Price after 32 months = $303.3105264 + 20% of $303.3105264 = $365.6220528
Price after 34 months = $365.6220528 + 20% of $365.6220528 = $438.24421056
Price after 36 months = $438.24421056 + 20% of $438.24421056 = $526.488842112

"To find the total value of all the toys, we need to first determine the cost of each type of toy.

We know that one red car costs $4. Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and an action figure costs $5, the doll costs 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, we have the cost of one red car ($4) and the doll ($15). We also know there are 5 red cars. So, the total cost of the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

The total cost of the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

The total value of all the toys is the sum of the costs of the red cars, the doll, and the action figures: $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the income she would have earned by doing her taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the income she would have earned by doing her taxes herself. She would lose 3 hours of freelance work, which would result in a loss of $35/hour. So, the total loss would be:

3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, let's calculate the cost of hiring the accountant. The accountant charges $90.

To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the total loss:

$105 (loss) - $90 (cost) = $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer accessories she purchased.

The total cost of the accessories is the sum of the costs of the scanner, CD burner, and printer. 

Total cost of accessories = €157 (scanner) + €74 (CD burner) + €102 (printer) 
Total cost of accessories = €333

Now, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from the initial budget of €1500.

Money left for clothing = Initial budget - Total cost of accessories
Money left for clothing = €1500 - €333
Money left for clothing = €1167

The final answer is: 1167"
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we need to divide the total number of eggs required for the Spanish flans by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting job.

Total eggs required for 15 flans = 15 flans * 3 eggs/flan = 45 eggs
Eggs received per babysitting job = 9 eggs

Number of babysitting jobs required = Total eggs required / Eggs received per job
= 45 eggs / 9 eggs
= 5

Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times to have enough eggs for 15 Spanish flans.

"To solve this problem, let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can express this relationship as S = 2B.

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This can be expressed as (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Substituting S = 2B into the equation, we get (2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Combine like terms: 3B + 4 = 28.

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3B = 24.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 8.

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into S = 2B, which gives us S = 2(8) = 16.

Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.

"To find the total miles walked in a week, we need to calculate the miles walked on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, Pancho walks 20 miles per day. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so the total miles walked on weekdays is 20 * 5 = 100 miles.

On weekends, Pancho walks 10 miles per day. There are 2 weekend days in a week, so the total miles walked on weekends is 10 * 2 = 20 miles.

Now, we add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends to get the total miles walked in a week: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we can calculate the total age of the four birds: 
8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) + 8 (Sally Thirty-two) = 51

The total age of the four birds is 51."
"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to calculate the total monthly payment and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the total minimum payment: 
$300 (student loans) + $200 (credit card) + $500 (mortgage) = $1000

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum payment:
50% of $1000 = 0.5 * $1000 = $500

Now, we add this amount to the total minimum payment to get the new monthly payment:
$1000 (minimum) + $500 (50% more) = $1500

To find the total annual payment, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:
$1500 * 12 = $18,000

"To find the total time it will take Billy to peel and cut the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel each potato and the time it takes to cut each potato, then multiply these times by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

First, convert the time to peel one potato to seconds: 1.5 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 90 seconds

Now, add the time to peel and cut one potato: 90 seconds + 5 seconds = 95 seconds

Since there are 60 potatoes, multiply the time to peel and cut one potato by 60: 95 seconds * 60 = 5700 seconds

There are 60 seconds in a minute, so convert the total time to minutes: 5700 seconds / 60 = 95 minutes

"To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to first calculate their total revenue and total cost. 

First, let's calculate their total revenue. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10. Since they made $25 in profit, their total revenue is $25 + $10 = $35.

Now, let's calculate their total cost. They spend $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar per gallon. So, the total cost per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5. Since they made $35 in revenue, their total cost is $35 - $25 = $10.

Since they made $10 in total cost and they make $5 in cost per gallon, they must have made 10 / 5 = 2 gallons.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of lemons. They made 2 gallons and spend $3 for lemons per gallon. So, the total cost of lemons is 2 * $3 = $6.

"To find out how much money Zaid will have left, we need to calculate his expenses and donations step by step.

First, we calculate the amount Zaid spends on rent: 
1/4 of 6000 = 0.25 * 6000 = 1500

Next, we calculate the amount he spends on car fuel: 
1/3 of 6000 = 0.33 * 6000 = 2000

Now, we subtract these expenses from his total income: 
6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to charity: 
2500 / 2 = 1250

Now, we subtract the donation from the remaining amount: 
2500 - 1250 = 1250

Zaid gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$, so we subtract these amounts from the remaining amount: 
1250 - 200 - 700 = 350

The final amount Zaid will have left is 350."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of crabs each person has and then add them together.

We know that Bo has 40 crabs. Since Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.

Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, we can add the number of crabs each person has to find the total: 40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122 crabs.

"To find the number of votes the loser got, we need to first find the number of votes the winner got. 

Since the winner got 3/4 of the total votes, we can calculate the number of votes the winner got by multiplying the total number of votes by 3/4.

Number of votes the winner got = (3/4) * 80
= 60

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser got is the difference between the total number of votes and the number of votes the winner got.

Number of votes the loser got = Total number of votes - Number of votes the winner got

The number of votes the loser got is 20."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of red roses, white carnations, and pink calla lilies. 

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses is 4x. 

We also know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, so the number of pink calla lilies is 5x.

The total number of items ordered is the sum of red roses, white carnations, and pink calla lilies. Since we don't have any information about other items, we can assume that the total number of items ordered is the sum of these three. 

So, the total number of items ordered is x + 4x + 5x = 10x.

However, we are not given the total number of items ordered, but we know that Sandra has threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm. This implies that the total number of items ordered is at least the number of missing red roses. 

Since we don't know the exact number of missing red roses, we can't determine the exact number of red roses that must be delivered by 5 pm. However, we can express the number of red roses in terms of 'x'. 

The number of red roses is 4x. To find the minimum number of red roses that must be delivered by 5 pm, we need to find the smallest possible value of 'x' that satisfies the condition. 

Since we don't have any additional information, we can assume that the number of missing red roses is at least 1 (the minimum possible value). 

So, 4x ≥ 1. 

Solving for x, we get x ≥ 1/4. 

Since x must be a whole number (you can't order a fraction of a flower), the smallest possible value of x is 1. 

The number of red roses is 4x = 4(1) = 4.

Therefore, Fred must deliver at least 4 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote Jean's current age as J, Mark's current age as M, and Jan's current age as A.

We are given that Jean is two years older than Mark, so we can write an equation: J = M + 2.

We are also given that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Since Jan is 30 years old now, two years ago, Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old. Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 28 / 2 = 14 years. So, two years ago, Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old.

Now, we can find Mark's current age by adding 2 to his age two years ago: M = 19 + 2 = 21.

We already know that Jean is two years older than Mark, so we can find Jean's current age: J = M + 2 = 21 + 2 = 23.

Therefore, Jean is 23 years old.

"To find the total time taken by the well-rounded team, we can simply multiply the time taken by each member by 4 since each member runs 400 meters.

Time taken by the well-rounded team = 55 * 4 = 220 seconds

Now, let's calculate the time taken by the less well-rounded team. The first runner takes 60 seconds, and each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster. 

Time taken by the second runner = 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
Time taken by the third runner = 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
Time taken by the fourth runner = 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

Total time taken by the less well-rounded team = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds

The difference in time between the two teams = 222 - 220 = 2 seconds

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of two independent events: rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is 3/6, since there are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. This simplifies to 1/2.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2), since the events are independent. There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die (2, 4, and 6), so the probability of rolling an even number is 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2.

Now, we can calculate the difference in probabilities:

Probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 1/2
Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row: 1/2

The difference in probabilities is 1/2 - 1/2 = 0.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

(0) * 100 = 0%

Therefore, Jerry is not more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

"To find the total number of apples picked, we need to first determine how many apples Jenna picked. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom picked 20 apples, we can calculate Jenna's share as follows:

Jenna's apples = Mom's apples / 2
Jenna's apples = 20 / 2
Jenna's apples = 10

Now, to find the total number of apples picked, we add Jenna's apples to her mom's apples:

Total apples = Jenna's apples + Mom's apples
Total apples = 10 + 20
Total apples = 30

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of straw pieces used among the hamsters and rabbits. 

The hamsters have 10 cages with 5 pieces of straw each, so the total number of straw pieces used among the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

The rabbits have 20 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw pieces used among the rabbits is 20.

The total number of straw pieces used among the hamsters and rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70.

Since the total number of straw pieces distributed among the small rodents is 160, the number of straw pieces used among the rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, so the number of rats is 90 / 6 = 15.

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, the number of rats in each cage is 15 / 3 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months. 

The formula for simple interest is: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Here, Principal = $100
Rate = 2% or 0.02
Time = 3 months

Interest = $100 * 0.02 * 3
Interest = $6

So, the total amount Mandy should pay is the principal plus the interest: 
$100 + $6 = $106

The final answer is: $106"
"To find the total cost of the bags, we need to consider both the cost of purchasing the bags and the cost of transportation. 

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. The total cost of purchasing the bags is $20x. The cost of transportation is $2x. 

The total cost is $20x + $2x = $22x. 

The total revenue from selling the bags is $30x. 

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost, which is $30x - $22x = $8x. 

We are given that the profit is $400. So, we can set up the equation $8x = $400 and solve for x.

$8x = $400
x = $400 / $8
x = 50

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

"To find out how much they spent on food, we need to subtract $4.50 from the total cost of the tickets. 

Total cost of tickets = $20.25
Cost of food = Total cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50
Cost of food = $15.75

Total cost of tickets and food = $20.25 + $15.75
Total cost of tickets and food = $36.00

They went on 2 rides, and each ride costs $33. Total cost of rides = 2 * $33 = $66.

Total cost of all expenses = Total cost of tickets and food + Total cost of rides
Total cost of all expenses = $36.00 + $66
Total cost of all expenses = $102

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we need to divide the total cost by 3.

Cost per person = Total cost of all expenses / 3
Cost per person = $102 / 3
Cost per person = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total number of peaches John collects, we need to multiply the number of peaches he can collect per minute by the number of minutes he collects.

"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we need to divide the total weekly amount by 7 days.

Weekly amount of insects needed = 3.5 pounds
Number of days in a week = 7

Daily amount of insects needed = Weekly amount / Number of days
= 3.5 / 7
= 0.5 pounds

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks need 0.5 pounds of insects per day to survive.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of trees Tom plants and chops down over 10 years.

Tom plants 10 trees per year, so over 10 years, he plants 10 * 10 = 100 trees.

He chops down 2 trees per year, so over 10 years, he chops down 2 * 10 = 20 trees.

Initially, Tom had 50 trees. After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. To find 30% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.3, which equals 15. So, 15 trees die.

Now, we subtract the trees that died from the total number of trees Tom had initially: 50 - 15 = 35.

We also need to subtract the trees he chopped down: 35 - 20 = 15.

Therefore, Tom has 15 trees left.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pink and white flamingos at noon on Sunday.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. So, the remaining number of pink flamingos is 18 - 6 = 12.

Then, they painted 6 flamingos white and put them back out. Now, there are 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

On Sunday, they added 18 more pink flamingos. So, the total number of pink flamingos is 12 + 18 = 30.

The number of white flamingos remains the same, which is 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how much change Violetta will get, we need to first calculate the total cost of the crayons. Since she needs 5 crayons and each crayon costs $2, the total cost will be 5 * $2 = $10.

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount she has, which is $20. 

$20 - $10 = $10

So, Violetta will get $10 as change."
"To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser. 

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8.

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of one pen * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $12.00"
"To find the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used, we need to subtract the total amount of carrots distributed from the total amount available.

Total amount of carrots available = 200 pounds
Total amount of carrots to be distributed = 40 restaurants * 2 pounds/restaurant = 80 pounds

Number of pounds of carrots that will not be used = Total amount of carrots available - Total amount of carrots to be distributed
= 200 pounds - 80 pounds
= 120 pounds

"To find the number of children in Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Number of children = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)
= 23786 - (8417 + 9092)

There are 6277 children in Soda."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times that number, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards. So, now she has 20 + 60 = 80 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards. So, now she has 80 + 40 = 120 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokémon cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number is 60 + 40 = 100 cards. Twice that number is 2 * 100 = 200 cards. So, now she has 120 + 200 = 320 cards.

Therefore, Elaine now has 320 Pokémon cards.

"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to first determine how many sentences he edits for each publisher. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we can divide the total number of sentences by 2.

1000 sentences / 2 = 500 sentences per publisher

Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, we can calculate the amount Mark earns from Publisher A:

500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, we can calculate the amount Mark earns from Publisher B:

500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

Now, we can add the amounts Mark earns from both publishers to find his total weekly earnings:

2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

Mark makes 7500 cents in a week."
"To find the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the amount of water he gets in the morning and the amount he gets in the afternoon, then add them together.

In the morning, Baldur gets 5 pails of water, and each pail contains 5 liters. So, the amount of water he gets in the morning is 5 pails * 5 liters/pail = 25 liters.

In the afternoon, Baldur gets 6 pails of water, and each pail contains 5 liters. So, the amount of water he gets in the afternoon is 6 pails * 5 liters/pail = 30 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water he gets in the morning and the afternoon to find the total amount of water he gets every day: 25 liters + 30 liters = 55 liters.

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider the monetary reward and the raise in salary.

First, let's calculate the monetary reward: $5000.

Since John received the award on the first day of the year, he will receive the raise for the entire year. The raise is 5% of his current salary, which is $2000. 

5% of $2000 is 0.05 * $2000 = $100.

So, his new salary will be $2000 + $100 = $2100.

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the year. He will receive the award on the first day of the year, so he will receive the award once. 

His total earnings for the year will be the award amount plus his annual salary: $5000 + $2100 = $7100.

However, since he receives $2000 per week, we need to calculate how many weeks he worked in the year. There are 52 weeks in a year.

His total earnings for the year will be the award amount plus his annual salary: $5000 + ($2000 * 52) = $5000 + $104,000 = $104,500.

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal and then add them together.

Carl ate a sandwich for lunch every day, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he used 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. So, for 3 days, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

Carl also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese, using 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add up the slices of cheese Carl used: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices of cheese.

"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the number of pens she initially had and then add the pens she bought.

Initially, Janet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. So, the total number of pens she initially had is 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens, each containing 9 pens, so she got 6 * 9 = 54 blue pens. She also bought 2 bags of red pens, each containing 6 pens, so she got 2 * 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, we add the pens she initially had to the pens she bought: 32 (initial pens) + 54 (blue pens) + 12 (red pens) = 98 pens.

Janet now has 98 pens.

"To find the required score, we first need to calculate the total score Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93. Since there are six tests, the total score required for an average of 93 is 93 * 6 = 558.

We know Brinley's scores for the first five tests: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The sum of these scores is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 358.

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score among the given scores. The lowest score is 71.

To find the total score Brinley needs, we subtract the lowest score from the required total score: 558 - 71 = 487.

Now, we subtract the sum of the remaining scores from the total score Brinley needs: 487 - 358 = 129.

This means Brinley needs a score of 129 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

"To find the total number of kilometers Micheal rode his bike, we need to calculate the total kilometers he rode in the first four weeks and the total kilometers he rode in the last three weeks.

In the first four weeks, Micheal rode his bike 5 times a week, 25 kilometers each time. So, the total kilometers he rode in the first four weeks is 5 * 25 * 4 = 100 kilometers.

In the last three weeks, Micheal rode his bike 2 times a week, 60 kilometers each time. So, the total kilometers he rode in the last three weeks is 2 * 60 * 3 = 360 kilometers.

To find the total number of kilometers Micheal rode his bike, we need to add the kilometers he rode in the first four weeks and the kilometers he rode in the last three weeks. So, the total kilometers he rode is 100 + 360 = 460 kilometers.

The total number of kilometers Micheal rode his bike is 460."
"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately and then add them together.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, so each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. Since there are 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples together to get the total weight of the bag of candy: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that twenty dozen cups is equal to 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

We also know that half a dozen plates is equal to 6 plates.

The total cost of 6 plates is $6000.

Since twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of 6 plates, we can set up an equation:

Total cost of 6 plates - $1200 = Total cost of 240 cups

Total cost of 6 plates = $6000 + $1200
Total cost of 6 plates = $7200

Now, we can find the cost of one cup by dividing the total cost of 240 cups by 240:

Cost of one cup = Total cost of 240 cups / 240
Cost of one cup = $7200 / 240
Cost of one cup = $30

The total cost of buying each cup is $30."
"To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn for the jacket and shoes. 

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20, so the total cost is $30 + $20 * 2 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs to earn $70 - $10 = $60 more.

Since she earns $5 per babysitting session and $4 per lawn mowing session, we can set up an equation to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn:

$60 / $4 = x (number of times she needs to mow the lawn)

x = $60 / $4
x = 15

Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn 15 times to earn enough money to buy the jacket and shoes.

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so we can express this as w = r + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42, and the number of eggs produced by red chickens is 3 times the number of red chickens (3r), and the number of eggs produced by white chickens is 5 times the number of white chickens (5w). Therefore, we can set up the equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find the total time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park since he walks around its edge. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the dimensions of the park (1.5 miles by 6 miles), we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(1.5 + 6)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at 3 miles/hour, we can divide the perimeter by his speed to find the time spent walking:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find the total number of customers on the first two days. 

Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so the number of customers on the second day is x + 50.

The total number of customers on the first two days is x + (x + 50). We know that the total number of customers by the third day is 500. Since the third day's customers are the sum of the first two days, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 50) + (x + 50) = 500

Combine like terms:

3x + 100 = 500

Subtract 100 from both sides:

3x = 400

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 133.33

Since the number of customers must be a whole number, we can round x to 133. However, we are looking for the number of customers on the third day, which is x + 50. 

x + 50 = 133 + 50 = 183

Therefore, Sloane counted 183 customers on the third day.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool was 2x gallons.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the amount of water lost from the small pool in 4 minutes is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons. The amount of water lost from the big pool in 4 minutes is also 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as y gallons. The current amount of water in the big pool is 4y gallons.

Since the big pool had 2x gallons initially and lost 16 gallons, the current amount of water in the big pool is 2x - 16. We know this is equal to 4y, so we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4y

We also know that the small pool lost 16 gallons, so the current amount of water in the small pool is x - 16. We are told that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool, so we can set up another equation:

4y = x - 16

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x and y by substituting the expression for y from the second equation into the first equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)
2x - 16 = 4x - 64
-2x = -48
x = 24

Now that we know x, we can find y by substituting x into one of the equations:

4y = x - 16
4y = 24 - 16
4y = 8
y = 2

So, the small pool has 2 gallons of water now.

"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we need to calculate the total amount she will pay over 12 months and subtract it from the initial amount she borrowed.

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. This means she will return $2000 + 10% of $2000, which is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

However, she will pay $165 per month for 12 months. To find the total amount she will pay, we multiply the monthly payment by the number of months: $165 * 12 = $1980.

Now, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she needs to return: $2200 - $1980 = $220.

So, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be $220.

First, we know there are 4 roses. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias by adding 7 to the number of roses: 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias.

Now, we add the number of roses and dahlias to find the total number of flowers: 4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15 flowers.

The total number of flowers in the vase is 15."
"To find the current ages of Adrian and Zack, we need to use the given information. 

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as follows:
Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 * 21
Zack's age = 42

Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, we can calculate Adrian's age as follows:
Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 * 21
Adrian's age = 63

Now, we need to find their ages in three years. 
Adrian's age in three years = Adrian's current age + 3
Adrian's age in three years = 63 + 3
Adrian's age in three years = 66

Zack's age in three years = Zack's current age + 3
Zack's age in three years = 42 + 3
Zack's age in three years = 45

Harriet's age in three years = Harriet's current age + 3
Harriet's age in three years = 21 + 3
Harriet's age in three years = 24

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
Average age = (Adrian's age in three years + Zack's age in three years + Harriet's age in three years) / 3
Average age = (66 + 45 + 24) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3

The average age of the three in three years is 45."
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna.

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. 
Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 
Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know that the total points scored by all four students is 251. We can subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total to find out how many points Jojo scored.
251 - 68 - 44 - 85 = 54

"To find the total cost of their rentals, we need to calculate the cost for each person separately and then add them together.

Carlos rented a canoe for 3 hours at $30 per hour, so his total cost is:
3 hours * $30/hour = $90

Benji rented a banana boat raft for 5 hours at $18 per hour, so his total cost is:
5 hours * $18/hour = $90

Now, we add their costs together to find the total cost:
$90 (Carlos) + $90 (Benji) = $180

The total cost for their rentals is $180."
"To determine the total number of days for the round trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each leg of the journey.

The time taken to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus is 6 days. Since it takes half as many days to travel by car, the time taken to travel from Rochester to New Jersey by car is 6 / 2 = 3 days.

To find the total number of days for the round trip, we add the time taken for each leg: 6 days (bus) + 3 days (car) = 9 days.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to first find the total number of water type cards James has after losing 8 and buying 14.

Initially, James had 40 water type cards. After losing 8, he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards. Then, he buys 14 more, so he now has 32 + 14 = 46 water type cards.

The total number of cards James has is the sum of all types: 30 fire type + 20 grass type + 46 water type = 96 cards.

The percentage chance of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, multiplied by 100.

Chance = (46 / 96) * 100 ≈ 47.92%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the chance is approximately 48%."
"To calculate the total cost of Chad's meal, we need to add up the cost of the base burrito, the extra items, and the upgrade.

The base burrito costs $6.50.
Extra meat: $2.00
Extra cheese: $1.00
Avocado: $1.00
2 sauces: 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
Total cost of extra items: $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50

The upgrade costs $3.00.

Now, let's add the cost of the extra items and the upgrade to the base burrito: $6.50 + $4.50 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract that from the total: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Chad still owes $9.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can place per minute. 

Since Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute, her mom can place half of that, which is 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

Together, they can place 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Since there are 360 pieces in the puzzle, we can divide 360 by 6 to find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle: 360 / 6 = 60 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 60 / 60 = 1 hour.

Therefore, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

60"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, there were 120 baby watermelons. 30% of them were ready for harvest, so the number of watermelons ready for harvest is 30% of 120, which is 0.3 * 120 = 36.

The remaining watermelons are 120 - 36 = 84.

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready for harvest. To find the number of watermelons ready for harvest, we multiply the remaining melons by 3/4, which is 84 * 3/4 = 63.

The number of watermelons not ready for harvest after the two weeks is 84 - 63 = 21.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees separately and then add them together.

The cost of the cars is 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.

The tax on the cars is 10% of $240,000, which is 0.1 * $240,000 = $24,000.

The registration fees for the cars are $1000 * 12 = $12,000.

The total cost is $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

"To find out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we need to first determine how many shells she collected on Monday. 

Since Robert collects 20 shells and Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. So, she collects 2 * 25 = 50 shells on Tuesday.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of insects in the garden, we need to first determine the number of bugs. Since there are half as many bugs as ants, we can calculate the number of bugs by dividing the number of ants by 2.

Number of ants = 50
Number of bugs = 50 / 2 = 25

Now, we need to add the number of bugs and ants to find the total number of insects in the garden.

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
= 50 + 25
= 75

The total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To find the number of penguins still sunbathing, we first need to determine how many penguins left sunbathing after the first two groups leave. 

One-third of the penguins (36 / 3 = 12) jump in the ocean, and another one-third (36 / 3 = 12) go inside the cave. 

So, the total number of penguins that left is 12 + 12 = 24. 

Now, we subtract the number of penguins that left from the total number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12.

Therefore, 12 penguins are still sunbathing.

"To determine the number of vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate how many tomatoes he eats per week. Since Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day and there are 7 days in a week, he eats 6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes per week.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half of what he eats, which is 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes per week.

In total, Steve and his girlfriend eat 42 + 21 = 63 tomatoes per week.

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we can divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by 3 to find the number of vines needed: 63 / 3 = 21.

Therefore, Steve needs 21 vines to meet his and his girlfriend's weekly tomato consumption.

21"
"To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we need to divide the total number of slices required by the number of slices per pizza. 

Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices and John wants each of his 20 friends to have 4 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices needed as follows:

Total slices needed = Number of friends * Slices per friend
Total slices needed = 20 * 4
Total slices needed = 80

Now, we divide the total slices needed by the number of slices per pizza to find the number of pizzas needed:

Number of pizzas = Total slices needed / Slices per pizza
Number of pizzas = 80 / 8
Number of pizzas = 10

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of new pens Ram can make from the ink of the 25 pens. 

Since Ram can make one full pen from the ink of 5 empty pens, we can divide the total number of pens by 5 to find out how many full pens he can make.

25 pens / 5 pens per full pen = 5 full pens

Since each full pen can be used to make 5 new pens, we multiply the number of full pens by 5.

5 full pens * 5 new pens per full pen = 25 new pens

In addition to the 25 new pens, Ram already has the 25 pens he bought initially. So, the total number of pens he has is:

25 (initial pens) + 25 (new pens) = 50 pens

The final answer is 50."
"To find the amount of money Johnny had after a year, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Johnny initially had $20 and added $10 to it, so the total amount of money he had was $20 + $10 = $30.
2. The money tripled in a year, which means it became 3 times the initial amount. So, we multiply the initial amount by 3: $30 * 3 = $90.

Therefore, Johnny had $90 after a year.

"To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we need to first determine the ages of Mary and Joan.

Since Jessa is 20 years old, and Joan is five years older than Jessa, Joan's age is 20 + 5 = 25 years.

Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary's age is 25 - 2 = 23 years.

Now, we can find the sum of their ages: 20 (Jessa) + 25 (Joan) + 23 (Mary) = 68 years.

The sum of the ages of the three girls is 68."

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many candies Robert has. 

Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies, we can set up the equation: 
2 * Robert's candies = 54
Robert's candies = 54 / 2
Robert's candies = 27

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find out how many candies James has. 
James has 6 more candies than Robert, so:
James' candies = Robert's candies + 6
James' candies = 27 + 6
James' candies = 33

Now that we know James has 33 candies, we can find out how many more candies John has than James:
John's candies - James' candies = 54 - 33
John's candies - James' candies = 21

Since they read each other's books as well as their own, we can break it down as follows:

- Dolly reads her own 2 books.
- Dolly reads Pandora's 1 book.
- Pandora reads her own 1 book.
- Pandora reads Dolly's 2 books.

So, the total number of books they collectively read is: 2 (Dolly's own) + 1 (Pandora's) + 1 (Pandora's own) + 2 (Dolly's) = 6

"To find out how many letters Mike writes per week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he writes and receives.

He has 3 remaining penpals, and each sends 2 letters a week, so he receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters per week.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters per week.

In total, Mike writes 6 (sent) + 6 (received) = 12 letters per week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so he writes 12 * 5 = 60 pages per week.

He can write a page every 6 minutes, so the total time spent writing per week is 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

Since Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day, and this month has 30 days, the total minutes used for these calls would be:
15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

Additionally, Jason has had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. 

Now, we need to subtract the total minutes used and the extra minutes from his total plan:
1000 minutes - 450 minutes - 300 minutes = 250 minutes

So, Jason has 250 minutes left for the month."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 fries, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, but we don't know how many she gave yet. Let's call the number of fries Ginger gave 'x'. After Ginger gave her fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now, Griffin has 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We are given that Griffin ended up with 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27.

Solving for x, we get x = 20.

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails. According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Since x represents the number of fish in each aquarium, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

"To calculate the total amount Jean paid, we need to first calculate the total hours worked. 

She works 6 hours a day for 4 days a week, so the total hours worked per week is 6 * 4 = 24 hours. Since the movie takes 5 weeks, the total hours worked is 24 * 5 = 120 hours.

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total amount charged is 120 * 250 = $30,000.

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives a 10% discount. To calculate the discount, we need to find 10% of $30,000, which is 0.1 * 30,000 = $3,000.

The final amount Jean paid is the total amount charged minus the discount, which is 30,000 - 3,000 = $27,000.

"To find out how many cookies Sue ate on Monday, we need to multiply the number of cookies her sister ate on Monday by 4. 

Sue's cookies on Monday = 4 * 5 = 20 cookies

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, who ate 13 cookies. 

Sue's cookies on Tuesday = 2 * 13 = 26 cookies

Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 + 26 = 46 cookies

Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies

To find the difference in calories, we multiply the total cookies eaten by each by 200.

Total calories eaten by Sue = 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
Total calories eaten by her sister = 18 * 200 = 3600 calories

Difference in calories = 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the school. Since the school is 50% girls, we can calculate the total number of girls as follows:

Total number of girls = Total number of students * 0.5
Total number of students = 3 classes * 20 students/class = 60 students
Total number of girls = 60 students * 0.5 = 30 girls

Now, we know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. We can subtract these from the total number of girls to find the number of girls in the third class:

Number of girls in the third class = Total number of girls - (Number of girls in the first class + Number of girls in the second class)
Number of girls in the third class = 30 girls - (15 girls + 12 girls)
Number of girls in the third class = 30 girls - 27 girls
Number of girls in the third class = 3 girls

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 30. We can calculate the number of boys in the third class by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of students in the third class:

Number of boys in the third class = Total number of students in the third class - Number of girls in the third class
Number of boys in the third class = 20 students - 3 girls
Number of boys in the third class = 17 boys

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many bananas Jamal has. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples, we can find Jamal's apples by subtracting 8 from 52.

Jamal's apples = 52 - 8 = 44

Since Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, we can find Jamal's bananas by adding 4 to his apples.

Jamal's bananas = 44 + 4 = 48

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so we can find Andrea's bananas by dividing Jamal's bananas by 2.

Andrea's bananas = 48 / 2 = 24

Net proceeds = -$32,000 - $250,000 = -$282,000

The net proceeds from selling the house is -$282,000."
"To find the total time, we need to break it down into three parts: heating the oil, heating the oil to the desired temperature, and cooking the chicken.

1. Heating the oil: 20 minutes
2. Heating the oil to the desired temperature: 20 minutes * 1.4 (40% longer) = 28 minutes
3. Cooking the chicken: 28 minutes - 5 minutes = 23 minutes

Total time = 20 minutes + 28 minutes + 23 minutes = 71 minutes

"To find the total amount spent on newspaper ads, we multiply the cost per ad by the number of ads: 
$5 * 50 = $250

To find the total amount spent on television ads, we multiply the cost per ad by the number of ads: 
$75 * 15 = $1125

Now, we add the total amount spent on newspaper ads and television ads to find the overall total: 
$250 + $1125 = $1375

The real estate agent spent $1375 on buying all the ads."
"To find the number of blue golf balls, we need to break down the information step by step.

1. The juggler can juggle 16 balls in total.
2. Half of the balls are golf balls, so the number of golf balls is 16 / 2 = 8.
3. Half of the golf balls are blue, so the number of blue golf balls is 8 / 2 = 4.

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then add them together.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

The total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To find the total number of windows between the houses, we first need to calculate the total number of windows in each house. 

Each house has 3 bedrooms with 2 windows each, so the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 3 * 2 = 6. 

Additionally, each house has 4 windows not connected to bedrooms, so the total number of windows in each house is 6 + 4 = 10.

Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows between the houses is 10 * 2 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost of the items purchased, we need to add the cost of cocoa, laundry, and pasta.

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $14.99

Since the mother paid $20, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid to find the change.

Change = $20 - $14.99 = $5.01

The cashier gives the mother $5.01 in change."
"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we need to first determine the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette. 

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches used for the body, which is 900 stitches. 
So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know that the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We also know that the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes 90 stitches, and the rosette takes 180 stitches. 

To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we subtract the total number of stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette from the total number of stitches for the sweater. 
1800 - 900 - 90 - 180 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the remaining stitches by 2 to find the number of stitches for each sleeve. 
630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

The final answer is 315."
"To find the total cost of the seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the cost of the celery seeds separately and then add them together.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, we know the solo song has 54 lines. 

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. Since only a third of the lines in the first scene are Sean's, he has to memorize 1/3 * 108 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Since four-fifths of the lines in the second scene are Sean's, he has to memorize 4/5 * 60 = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from both scenes: 36 + 48 = 84.

The final answer is: 84"

3. Then, find the number of cards with the letter B: 1/2 of the remaining 48 cards = (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards
4. The remaining cards are 48 - 24 = 24 cards
5. Finally, find the number of cards with the letter D: 5/8 of the remaining 24 cards = (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards

The number of cards with the letter D is 15."
"To find the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

Time for small holes: 30 holes * 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes
Time for large holes: 15 holes * 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes

Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

"To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to first find their current ages. 

Let's denote Mico's current age as M and Marco's current age as C. We know that M + C = 20.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be M + 10 and Marco's age will be C + 10. 

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (M + 10) + (C + 10) = M + C + 20.

Since M + C = 20, we can substitute this into the equation: 
M + C + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40.

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40."
"Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S. 

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can express this as R = 6S.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9, and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can express this as R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Substituting R = 6S into the equation, we get 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Expanding the equation, we get 6S + 9 = 3S + 27.

Subtracting 3S from both sides, we get 3S + 9 = 27.

Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get 3S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get S = 6.

Therefore, Sam is 6 years old now.

"To find the total number of spots, we first need to find the number of spots on each type of snake. 

Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas. The total number of spots on cobras is 40 * 70 = 2800. The total number of spots on mambas is 60 * 35 = 2100.

The total number of spots is 2800 + 2100 = 4900.

Half of the total number of spots is 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is 2450."
"To determine the total number of people attending the soccer game, we need to calculate the number of team members and their guests. 

There are 12 team members, and each team member brings 2 guests. So, the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. 

Adding the team members and their guests, we get 12 + 24 = 36 people.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we need 36 / 3 = 12 pizzas.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost will be 12 * $15 = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we need to first find the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones. Since there are 8 gemstones, each 1 inch long, the total length occupied by the gemstones is 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and the gemstones occupy 8 inches, so the remaining space for the beads is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Since each bead is one-quarter of an inch long, we can find the number of beads by dividing the remaining space by the length of each bead: 17 / 0.25 = 68.

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"To find the total number of stories written, we need to calculate the number of stories each person wrote in the second week and then add them up.

In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. 

In the second week, Alani doubled her stories from the first week, so she wrote 2 * 20 = 40 stories. 
Braylen doubled his stories from the first week, so he wrote 2 * 40 = 80 stories. 
Margot doubled her stories from the first week, so she wrote 2 * 60 = 120 stories.

Now, we add up the total number of stories written in both weeks:
Alani's total: 20 + 40 = 60
Braylen's total: 40 + 80 = 120
Margot's total: 60 + 120 = 180

The total number of stories written altogether is 60 + 120 + 180 = 360.

"To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has and subtract the cost of the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, the total value of the quarters is 5 * 25 = 125 cents.

She also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, the total value of the dimes is 2 * 10 = 20 cents.

The total amount of money Kelly has is 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

The can of pop costs 55 cents. To find out how many cents she will have left, we subtract the cost of the pop from the total amount of money she has: 145 - 55 = 90 cents.

"To find the total number of rows of 5 stars, we first need to find the total number of stars on the flag. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 3 * 8 = 24. 
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 * 6 = 12. 
The remaining stars are 76 - (24 + 12) = 40. 

Since each row of 5 stars has 5 stars, we divide 40 by 5 to find the number of rows of 5 stars. 40 / 5 = 8. 

Therefore, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. 

Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane.

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of medals Ali has as A and the number of medals Izzy has as I. We know that Ali has 22 medals, so A = 22.

We also know that Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so I = A - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17.

The total number of medals they have together is A + I = 22 + 17 = 39.

The problem states that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. Let's denote the total number of medals given out as T. This can be represented as:

A + I = 10T

Substituting the values we know, we get:

22 + 17 = 10T
39 = 10T

To find T, we divide both sides by 10:

T = 39 / 10
T = 3.9

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 3.9.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available. 

There are 4 adults and 8 children, making a total of 12 people. Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets. 

Total chocolate bars = 8 packets * 5 chocolate bars/packet = 40 chocolate bars

Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults = 4 adults * 6 chocolate bars/adult = 24 chocolate bars

The remaining chocolate bars are for the children. 

Remaining chocolate bars = Total chocolate bars - Chocolate bars given to adults = 40 - 24 = 16 chocolate bars

There are 8 children, and the remaining chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them. 

Number of chocolate bars each child gets = Remaining chocolate bars / Number of children = 16 / 8 = 2 chocolate bars"
"To calculate the total amount of money Susan earns, we need to first determine the total number of minutes she works. 

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works for 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total minutes she works. 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we can divide the total minutes she works by 10 to find out how many 10-minute intervals she works. 150 / 10 = 15.

Now, we multiply the number of 10-minute intervals by the amount she earns per interval, which is $5. 15 * $5 = $75.

The final answer is 75."
"To find the initial points of each player, we need to calculate based on the given information.

Mike has 21 points.

Since Jim has 3 points less than Mike, Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.

Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

Now, let's calculate the points after the fourth round. 

In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 

- Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total 22 points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is less than 20, so he doesn't get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is more than 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players after the fourth round: 
Mike has 22 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points. 
22 + 18 + 43 = 83 points.

The total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed is 83."

"To determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day. So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

To find out how many days the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the daily consumption: 42 kg / 2 kg = 21 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of days by 7 to find out how many weeks the rice will last: 21 days / 7 days/week = 3 weeks.

The 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."

"To find out how much Carmen paid for the desk, we need to calculate the total amount she bid. 

The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time. Since there were 3 other people who bid once, the total number of bids made by Carmen is 3 (from the other people) + 1 (Carmen's initial bid) = 4 bids.

The bids start at $200 and increase by $50 each time. So, the sequence of bids is: $200, $250, $300, $350.

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, which means she bids at $250, $300, and $350. 

The total amount she paid is the sum of her bids: $200 (initial bid) + $250 + $300 + $350 = $1100.

"To calculate the total cost of driving, we need to calculate the total miles driven per year and the total miles driven per day.

Total miles driven per year = 2 * 30 miles * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 30,000 miles/year

Total miles driven per day = 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles/day

Total miles driven per month = 60 miles/day * 30 days/month = 1800 miles/month

Total miles driven per year = 1800 miles/month * 12 months/year = 21,600 miles/year

Now, let's calculate the total cost of driving:

Total miles driven per year * cost per mile = 21,600 miles/year * $2/mile = $43,200/year

Additionally, John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Total bonus per year = $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800/year

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to first determine how many books she sold in the second year. 

We know that she sold 45 books this year, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. So, the number of books she sold in the first year is 2 * 45 = 90 books.

The total number of books she has sold in the first two years is 90 + 45 = 135 books.

Since there are 250 books in total, and 50 books are unsold, the number of books she has sold in the first two years is 250 - 50 = 200 books.

We know that she sold 135 books in the first two years, so the number of books she sold in the second year is 200 - 135 = 65 books.

Since each book sells at 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 65 * 20 = 1300$.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand that both Sandy and Joey are losing the same amount of weight, but Sandy is doing it over a longer period. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can calculate the weight loss per week for Joey as follows:

Weight loss per week for Joey = Total weight loss / Number of weeks
Weight loss per week for Joey = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weight loss per week for Joey = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and she loses 2 pounds per week, we can calculate the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey:

Number of weeks for Sandy = Total weight loss / Weight loss per week for Sandy
Number of weeks for Sandy = 8 pounds / 2 pounds per week
Number of weeks for Sandy = 4 weeks

Therefore, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, 5 times that amount is 5 * $100 = $500. Adding $700 to that makes the flight ticket $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up the costs: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

Theo wants to save $2000, so he has $6000 - $2000 = $4000 left to spend on gifts.

The final answer is: $4000"
"To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to calculate the number of eggs consumed by the three people who eat three eggs each day and the number of eggs consumed by the two people who eat two eggs each day.

Three people eat three eggs each day, so they consume 3 * 3 = 9 eggs per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, they consume 9 * 7 = 63 eggs in a week.

Two people eat two eggs each day, so they consume 2 * 2 = 4 eggs per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, they consume 4 * 7 = 28 eggs in a week.

The total number of eggs consumed in a week is the sum of the eggs consumed by the two groups, which is 63 + 28 = 91 eggs.

"To find Trent's age, we need to work backwards from Quinn's age. 

Quinn is 30 years old. 
Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so Jane is 30 - 3 = 27 years old. 
Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so Trent is 27 + 5 = 32 years old.

32"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote Noah's current age as N and Cera's current age as C. We are given that Cera is currently 46 years old, so C = 46.

Six years ago, Noah's age was N - 6, and Cera's age was C - 6. We are also given that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so we can set up the equation:

N - 6 = (1/2)(C - 6)

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, and the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. Let's denote the current population of Chile as P. Then, the population six years ago was P/2. We can set up the equation:

P/2 = 3000(N - 6)

We can simplify this equation to:

P = 6000(N - 6)

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the expression for C from the first equation into the second equation:

P = 6000(N - 6)
P = 6000((1/2)(C - 6) + 6)
P = 3000(C - 6) + 36000

Now we can substitute C = 46 into this equation:

P = 3000(46 - 6) + 36000
P = 3000(40) + 36000
P = 120000 + 36000
P = 156000

The final answer is: 156000"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as D. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is D/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. Therefore, the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams is equal to 105:

2D + D + D/2 = 105

To solve for D, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

4D + 2D + D = 210

Combine like terms:

7D = 210

Divide both sides by 7:

D = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

"To find the total number of people invited, we need to calculate the number of people in each group and add them together. 

There are 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 * 6 = 12 people. 
There are 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 * 4 = 12 people. 
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people. 
We subtract these 2 people from the total number of people who were supposed to come: 16 - 2 = 14.

Therefore, 14 people show up for Martha's party."
"To find the total weight of marbles, we first need to calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has. 

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 

2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. 

So, Solomon's father gave him 8 marbles. 

Now, we add the marbles Solomon bought from Johanna (20) to the marbles his father gave him (8) to get the total number of marbles: 20 + 8 = 28.

The store already had 50 marbles. 

The total number of marbles in the store is 50 (initial marbles) + 28 (marbles bought and given by Solomon) = 78.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble to get the total weight: 78 * 2 = 156.

The total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 156 kgs."
"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool first. The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the pool) is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height.

Length (L) = 6 feet
Width (W) = 4 feet
Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume (V) = L * W * H
V = 6 * 4 * 5
V = 120 cubic feet

Now, we can calculate the cost to fill the pool by multiplying the volume by the cost per cubic foot.

Cost = Volume * Cost per cubic foot
Cost = 120 * $0.1
Cost = $12

The cost to fill the pool is $12."
"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to first find the number of girls and nongendered children.

Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.

The number of nongendered children is 1/10 of the number of boys, which is 1/10 * 30 = 3.

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

The total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to first find the number of electric poles. 

Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles. 

Let's say the number of electric poles is x. Then, the number of electric wires is 3x. 

We are given that the total number of electric wires is 45. So, we can set up the equation 3x = 45.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3: 

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

So, the number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total number of people at the party initially, we need to add the number of men and women. 

Total people = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who left as follows:

Number of people who left = 1/4 * 40 = 10 people

Since 22 men stayed at the party, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3 men.

Now, we know that 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men. So, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7 women.

To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:

Number of women left = 15 - 7 = 8 women

The final answer is 8."
"To find the cost of the pen, we need to first find the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, we know that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. So, the cost of the pen is $2 - $1 = $1.

The final answer is 1."
"To find the total number of pencils, we need to add the pencils Jam has to the pencils Meg has. 

Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, so let's first find out how many pencils are in the boxes. Since we don't know the exact number of pencils in each box, let's represent the number of pencils in each box as 'x'. 

The total number of pencils Jam has is 3x + 2. 

Meg has 46 pencils. 

The total number of pencils is 3x + 2 + 46. 

Since the total number of pencils is 26, we can set up the equation: 
3x + 2 + 46 = 26

Now, let's solve for x:
3x + 48 = 26
3x = -22
x = -22/3

Since the number of pencils in a box cannot be negative, this equation doesn't have a valid solution. However, we can try to find a different approach.

Let's re-examine the problem. We know that the total number of pencils is 26. We also know that Jam has 2 loose pencils. So, the total number of pencils in the boxes is 26 - 2 = 24.

Since Jam has 3 boxes, we can divide 24 by 3 to find the number of pencils in each box:
24 / 3 = 8

Now that we know the number of pencils in each box, we can find the total number of boxes needed. 

Jam has 3 boxes and Meg has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils is 26. We already know that Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each. 

The total number of pencils in Jam's boxes is 3 * 8 = 24. 

Since the total number of pencils is 26, Meg must have 26 - 24 = 2 pencils. 

Since Meg has 2 pencils, she must have 1 box.

The total number of boxes needed is 3 (Jam's boxes) + 1 (Meg's box) = 4 boxes.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cooling effect of the ice cubes and the added cream on the coffee. 

First, let's calculate the cooling effect of the ice cubes. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and Shannon adds 5 ice cubes (assuming she uses 5 ice cubes to cool the coffee by 65 degrees), the total cooling effect is 5 * 13 = 65 degrees.

However, the coffee becomes 12 milliliters weaker for each ice cube. Since Shannon adds 5 ice cubes, the total weakening effect is 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters.

Now, let's consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. The cream weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

The total weakening effect is the sum of the weakening effects of the ice cubes and the cream, which is 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

Therefore, Shannon's iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

Final answer: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the ratio of old records to new records. We know that 2 old records can be traded for 1 new record. 

Given that 5 people come in and leave with 7 new records, we can set up an equation to represent the situation. Let's assume the number of old records brought in by the 5 people is x.

Since 2 old records can be traded for 1 new record, the total number of new records obtained is x/2.

We know that the total number of new records obtained is 7, so we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 7

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:

x = 7 * 2
x = 14

Therefore, the 5 people brought in 14 old records."
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the number of junior programmers, the number of senior programmers, and their respective salaries.

Given that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, and there are 100 employees in total, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100 = 40

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, and junior programmers are paid $2000 per month, we can calculate the salary of senior programmers as follows:

Salary of senior programmers = $2000 + $400 = $2400

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month:

Total amount = (Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers) + (Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers)
= (40 * $2000) + (60 * $2400)
= $80000 + $144000
= $184000

The final answer is: $184000"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the total number of people heading to the third stop. 

We know that 20 people were on the bus at the third stop. 

At the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in. This means that the number of people on the bus after the second stop is 20 - 7 + 8 = 21.

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in. This means that the number of people on the bus after the first stop is 21 - 5 = 16.

Since 5 people got in at the first stop, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To solve this problem, we need to track the changes in Oscar's lollipop count step by step.

Initially, Oscar has 24 lollipops.

1. He eats 2 on his way to school: 24 - 2 = 22
2. He passes 14 out to his friends: 22 - 14 = 8
3. He buys twice as many lollipops on his way home as he gave to his friends: 2 * 14 = 28, so he buys 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
4. He eats 3 more that night: 36 - 3 = 33
5. He eats 2 more in the morning: 33 - 2 = 31

Therefore, Oscar has 31 lollipops.

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to hours.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so the remaining charge is 100% - 60% = 40%.

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it takes to charge the remaining 40% as follows:

40% / 1% = 40 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time to hours by dividing by 60:

40 minutes / 60 = 2/3 hours

So, it will take 2/3 hours to fully charge the phone.

"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to follow the order of operations.

Initially, Erin has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her 10 more, so we add 7 + 10 = 17.

Then, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella, so we subtract 3 from 17: 17 - 3 = 14.

Therefore, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the total amount they spent after applying the rewards and the coupon.

First, let's calculate the rewards they received. They spent $80 and get $1 off for every $20 spent. So, they get 80 / 20 = 4 rewards. 

Since the rewards are $1 off, they get a total of 4 * $1 = $4 off.

However, the coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off, so the coupon takes 2 * $4 = $8 off.

Now, let's calculate the total amount they paid. They initially spent $80, then got $4 off, and then got $8 off from the coupon. So, the total amount they paid is 80 - 4 - 8 = $68.

The customer paid $68 on this shopping trip."
"To determine the net pay for each job, we need to calculate the total income and subtract the taxes.

Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Total hours worked: 2000 hours
- Total income: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Total tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:
- Annual salary: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate: 10% of net income
- Total tax: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net income: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Comparing the net incomes, Job B has a higher net pay rate. To find the difference, subtract the lower net income from the higher net income:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is $8,400."
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we need to calculate the number of ruined castles first. 

40% of 220 castles are ruins, so the number of ruined castles is 0.4 * 220 = 88.

Since half of the ruined castles are unmanned, we divide the number of ruined castles by 2. 
88 / 2 = 44.

Therefore, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of chickens and cows. We know that Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows. Let's denote the number of cows as 'c' and the number of chickens as '2c'. 

Since the total number of animals is 60, we can set up the equation: c + 2c = 60. 

Combine like terms: 3c = 60. 

Divide both sides by 3: c = 20. 

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens: 2c = 2 * 20 = 40. 

The total number of legs can be calculated by multiplying the number of cows by 4 (since cows have 4 legs) and the number of chickens by 2 (since chickens have 2 legs), then adding them together: (20 * 4) + (40 * 2) = 80 + 80 = 160. 

The final answer is 160."

"To solve this problem, we need to find the weight of each animal and then add the weight of the container.

We know the pink frog weighs 50 pounds. Since the pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we have the weights of all the animals: 
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

The total weight of the animals is 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 pounds.

Adding the weight of the container, the total weight is 240 + 20 = 260 pounds.

She needs 30 plant pots for the daisies and twice as many for the roses, so she needs 30 * 2 = 60 plant pots for the roses. 

The total number of plant pots needed is 30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = 90 plant pots.

Since April already had 100 plant pots, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number she already had: 100 - 90 = 10.

April has 10 plant pots left over."
"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent and gave away from the total amount she had initially.

Andrea initially had $36.
She spent $11 on a sweater and gave her brother $4.

Total amount spent = $11 (sweater) + $4 (given to her brother) = $15

Now, subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:
$36 (initial amount) - $15 (total amount spent) = $21

Andrea saved $21."
"To find the total time John spent on vacation, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them up.

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. 

He watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so he spent 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows.

The total time spent on these activities is 6 (boating) + 3 (swimming) + 6 (watching shows) = 15 hours.

Since 30% of his time was spent watching shows, we can set up an equation to find the total time spent on vacation. Let's call the total time spent on vacation 'x'. 

30% of x is equal to 15 hours, so 0.3x = 15. 

To find x, we divide both sides by 0.3: x = 15 / 0.3 = 50.

Since John spent 40% of his time sightseeing, we can find the time spent sightseeing by multiplying 0.4 by the total time spent on vacation: 0.4 * 50 = 20 hours.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and subtract the amount she already has.

First, let's calculate her earnings from the first job: 
20 hours * $10/hour = $200

Next, let's calculate her earnings from the second job: 
15 hours * $5/hour = $75

Now, let's add her earnings from both jobs: 
$200 + $75 = $275

Since Annabelle already has $80 in her savings, we subtract this amount from her total earnings: 
$275 - $80 = $195

Annabelle still needs $195 to save for the phone.

$195"
"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to first find the height of the second tree. 

The height of the shortest tree is 6 feet. 
The height of the second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so it is 6 + 5 = 11 feet.

The combined height of the two shortest trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the two shortest trees, so it is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

The final answer is 34."
"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he bought and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he had.

The total cost of the toy cars is 6 * $2 = $12.
The total cost of the teddy bears is 5 * $1 = $5.
The total cost of the items Dean bought is $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially had $28. After buying the items, he had $28 - $17 = $11.
His mother then gave him an extra $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

The final answer is 21."
"To determine the number of friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has available for the activities. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do:

- 1 round of mini-golf: $5
- Arcade tokens: $5
- 2 rides on the go-karts: 2 * $10 = $20

Total cost: $5 + $5 + $20 = $30

Now, let's subtract the total cost from her budget: $90 - $30 = $60

Since each friend will also get $5 in arcade tokens, we need to subtract this amount from the remaining budget: $60 - $5 = $55

Now, we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend (including the arcade tokens): $55 / $10 = 5.5

Since we can't invite half a friend, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Morgan can invite 5 friends to her party."
"To find out how much money Marisa saves, we need to calculate the total amount she spends on lollipops and subtract that from her daily pocket money.

Marisa buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, so the total cost of lollipops per day is 4 * 0.25 = $1.

Since she gets $5 as pocket money every day, the amount she saves per day is $5 - $1 = $4.

To find out how much she saves in 5 days, we multiply the daily savings by 5: $4 * 5 = $20.

The final answer is 20."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since Billy took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, the amount of money he had left is also $2. This means he had $10 - $2 = $8 left.

Now, we know that the total amount of money Billy had initially was $10, and he spent $8 on gumballs. So, the amount of money he spent on candy is $10 - $8 = $2.

Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, we can find the number of pounds of candy Billy bought by dividing the amount of money he spent on candy ($2) by the cost per pound ($1.5). 

$2 / $1.5 = 1.33 pounds.

So, Billy bought 1.33 pounds of candy."
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S. 

We know that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, so we can write the equation as:

C = 2S - 5

We also know that Carver is 45 years old, so we can substitute C with 45:

45 = 2S - 5

Now, we can solve for S by adding 5 to both sides of the equation:

45 + 5 = 2S - 5 + 5
50 = 2S

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

50 / 2 = 2S / 2
25 = S

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To determine the total distance traveled by the train in one trip, we need to calculate the distance from the first city to the third city. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles, and from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs, which is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. 

So, the distance from the third city to the first city is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

Now, we can calculate the total distance traveled in one trip: 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance by the service interval: 18,000 / 900 = 20 days.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the amount of stuffing needed for each type of bed, we need to calculate the average amount of stuffing for the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds.

The Rottweiler bed requires 8 pounds of stuffing, and the chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing. 

The average amount of stuffing for the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.

For 4 chihuahua beds, Mark will need 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing.

For 3 collie beds, Mark will need 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.

In total, Mark will need 8 + 15 = 23 pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

"To find the total time taken for the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the trip and then add them together.

First, we calculate the time taken to drive to his friend's house:
Distance = 200 miles
Speed = 70 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 200 / 70 = 2.86 hours

Next, we add the detour distance:
Detour distance = 10 miles
Total distance to his friend's house = 200 + 10 = 210 miles
Time taken to drive to his friend's house = 210 / 70 = 3 hours

Now, we calculate the time taken to drive back home:
Distance = 240 miles
Speed = 80 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 240 / 80 = 3 hours

Total time taken for the trip = Time taken to drive to his friend's house + Time taken to drive back home
Total time taken = 3 + 3 = 6 hours

"To find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to subtract the number of absent students from the total number of students.

First, let's find the total number of absent students: 
5 girls + 4 boys = 9 students

Now, subtract the number of absent students from the total number of students:
96 - 9 = 87

So, there were 87 fourth-grade students at Small Tree School on Friday.

The number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is 87 - 43 (number of girls) = 44."
"To find the number of boys in the park, we need to divide the number of girls by 2, since there are twice as many boys as girls.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as x. 

We are given that 3x - 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 

We also know that 3 times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, which means 3(3x - 5) were kicked out for physical violence.

The total number of people kicked out is 50. We can set up an equation to represent this:

x (refusing to wear masks) + (3x - 5) (shoplifting) + 3(3x - 5) (physical violence) = 50

Combine like terms:

x + 3x - 5 + 9x - 15 = 50

Combine like terms:

13x - 20 = 50

Add 20 to both sides:

13x = 70

Divide both sides by 13:

x = 5.38 (round down to 5 since we can't have a fraction of a person)

Now that we know x, we can find the number of people kicked out for shoplifting and physical violence:

Shoplifters: 3x - 5 = 3(5) - 5 = 10

Physical violence: 3(3x - 5) = 3(10) = 30

Now, we can find the number of people kicked out for other reasons by subtracting the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence from the total:

50 - 5 - 10 - 30 = 5

The number of people kicked out for other reasons is 5."
"To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to first find out how many points Sara had before. Since Sara scored 8 points and Erin scored 14 points, and Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can set up an equation.

Let's say Sara had x points before. Then, Erin had 3x points before. We know that Erin scored 14 points, so 3x = 14. 

To find x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 14 / 3. 

x = 4.67

So, Sara had approximately 4.67 points before. 

Now, to find out how many points Erin had before, we multiply x by 3: 3 * 4.67 = 14.

Therefore, Erin had 14 points before.

"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the expenses into different categories.

1. Picture frames: 
   - Each frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched with a logo, which adds 20% of the cost, so the etching cost is $20 * 0.20 = $4.
   - Total cost per frame is $20 + $4 = $24.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. Pins:
   - 2 seniors will receive pins, so the total cost for pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. Cords for officers:
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so the number of officers is 44 * 1/4 = 11.
   - Each cord costs $12, so the total cost for cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we add up the costs for all the items:
$1056 (picture frames) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1198.

The total cost for the senior gifts is $1198."
"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the cost of the materials first. 

Let's assume the cost of materials is x. 

Since the DIY costs 20% less than the market price, the cost of the DIY will be 80% of the market price. 

The market price is $400, so the DIY cost will be 80% of $400, which is 0.8 * 400 = $320.

Since the DIY cost is the sum of the cost of materials and the cost of labor, we can set up the equation:

x + labor cost = 320

However, the problem doesn't provide the labor cost. Assuming the labor cost is negligible or already included in the materials cost, we can assume the DIY cost is equal to the cost of materials.

Therefore, the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"To find the total number of tennis shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs, so we need to subtract those from the total. 

The total number of shoes sold is 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 14 (Sunday) - 6 (returns) = 50.

"To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to calculate the number of faulty pieces of equipment and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

Let's assume the total number of pieces of equipment is x. Since 40% of the total number were faulty, the number of faulty pieces is 0.4x.

The total cost of the equipment is $400,000. Since the faulty pieces were returned, the cost of the faulty pieces is 0.4x.

The cost of the functioning pieces is the total cost minus the cost of the faulty pieces, which is 400,000 - 0.4x.

However, we also need to find the total number of functioning pieces. Since 40% were faulty, 60% of the total number of pieces are functioning. So, the number of functioning pieces is 0.6x.

The cost of the functioning pieces can also be expressed as 0.6x.

Equating the two expressions for the cost of functioning pieces, we get:

400,000 - 0.4x = 0.6x

Solving for x, we get:

400,000 = 1x
x = 400,000

Now that we know the total number of pieces is 400,000, we can find the number of functioning pieces:

Number of functioning pieces = 0.6x
= 0.6 * 400,000
= 240,000

Now, we can find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces:

Total amount spent on functioning pieces = 0.6x
= 0.6 * 400,000
= 240,000

"To find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from each half of the sheep and then add them together.

Since Mary has 30 sheep, she has 15 sheep in each half. 

She gets 1 kg of milk from half of the sheep, which is 15 sheep. So, the milk from this half is 15 * 1 = 15 kg.

She gets 2 kg of milk from the other half, which is also 15 sheep. So, the milk from this half is 15 * 2 = 30 kg.

Now, we add the milk from both halves: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

Therefore, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day.

"To find out how many pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we first need to determine how many rolls were left after feeding her 6 children. 

Since she started with a dozen (12) rolls and fed 6 children, she had 12 - 6 = 6 rolls left.

Then, she broke each of the remaining 6 rolls into 8 pieces. To find the total number of pieces, we multiply the number of rolls by the number of pieces each roll was broken into: 6 * 8 = 48.

So, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

Now, we need to find the number of pupils who like green. One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. The remaining pupils are those who do not like blue, which is:
40 - 20 = 20 pupils.

One-fourth of 20 pupils like green:
20 / 4 = 5 pupils like green.

Now, we can find the number of pupils who like yellow by subtracting the number of pupils who like blue and green from the total number of pupils:
40 - 20 (blue) - 5 (green) = 15 pupils like yellow.

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

"To find out how many cookies are left for Rachel, we need to subtract the number of cookies she initially had, the number of cookies Janet gave her, and the number of cookies her brother ate.

Initial cookies = 23
Cookies from Janet = 42
Cookies eaten by brother = 44

Total cookies initially = 23 + 42 = 65
Total cookies eaten or given away = 44 + 23 = 67

Since 67 is more than the initial total, it means that the cookies given by Janet and eaten by the brother exceed the initial amount. In this case, we need to subtract the initial amount from the total to find the excess.

Cookies left = 65 - 65 = 0

However, since the initial amount is less than the total given and eaten, we can conclude that there are no cookies left for Rachel.

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the monthly interest and add it to the principal amount.

The formula for simple interest is: 

Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

In this case, the principal amount (P) is $3,650, the interest rate (R) is 10% or 0.10, and the time (T) is 5 months.

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Interest = $1,825

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we need to divide the total interest by the number of months:

Monthly interest = $1,825 / 5
Monthly interest = $365

So, Karan has to pay $365 per month.

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the amount of silver and gold they have.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so Anna has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. 

Axel has 80 gold pesos and Anna has 40 more gold pesos, so Anna has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 (Axel) + 100 (Anna) = 150.

The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 (Axel) + 120 (Anna) = 200.

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 (silver) + 200 (gold) = 350.

"To find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make, we multiply the number of pitchers by the number of cups per pitcher: 3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups.

Since Millie sells each cup of lemonade for $1, her total revenue from selling 36 cups of lemonade is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

To find the total number of hours Millie needs to run the lemonade stand to sell all the lemonade, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups sold per hour: 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

Now, we can find Millie's total profit by subtracting the initial cost from the total revenue: $36 (revenue) - $18 (cost) = $18 (profit).

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours: $18 (profit) / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the initial amount of land as x hectares.

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, the amount he sold is 3/5 * x hectares. The amount he has left is 12.8 hectares, which is 2/5 of his initial land (since 1 - 3/5 = 2/5).

We can set up the equation as follows:

2/5 * x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

"To determine how much money David saves, we need to calculate the cost of buying tickets for both of them and compare it to the cost of buying a ride bracelet for both of them.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying tickets for both of them. Each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, so the cost of one ride is 2 * 2 = $4. Since they want to ride all 9 rides, the total cost of tickets for both of them is 9 * 4 = $36.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying a ride bracelet for both of them. The cost of a ride bracelet is $30, which gives 9 rides. Since they want to ride all 9 rides, the cost of buying a ride bracelet for both of them is $30.

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract the cost of buying a ride bracelet from the cost of buying tickets: 36 - 30 = $6.

David saves $6 by buying a ride bracelet instead of buying tickets."

"To find out how much Tim saves by canceling his cable subscription, we need to calculate the cost of the streaming services he chooses.

First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services. 

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month. 
The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 per month each, but he gets a 20% discount for bundling them. 
The total cost of the bundled services is $10 + $10 = $20. 
The discount is 20% of $20, which is 0.2 * $20 = $4. 
So, the cost of the bundled services after the discount is $20 - $4 = $16.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the streaming services: 
$10 (Netflix) + $16 (bundled services) = $26.

The cost of the cable package is $60. 
The amount of money Tim saves by canceling his cable subscription is $60 - $26 = $34.

The final answer is: $34."
"To find the total work time, we need to convert all the time to the same unit. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, we can convert 4 hours to minutes as follows: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the total work time:
- Writing time: 240 minutes
- Recording time: 240 minutes / 2 = 120 minutes
- Editing time: 90 minutes
Total work time: 240 + 120 + 90 = 450 minutes

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we can divide the editing time by the total work time and multiply by 100:
(90 minutes / 450 minutes) * 100 = 20%

The final answer is 20."
"To find the total number of books Wendy needs, we first need to calculate the total capacity of the shelving system. Since it has 6 rows and 6 columns, the total capacity is 6 * 6 = 36 books.

Now, Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books. Double the number of books is 2 * 36 = 72. Adding 20 more books to this gives us 72 + 20 = 92 books.

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, the number of cards she gave away, and the number of cards she received.

Initially, Erica made 20 cards and received 2 boxes of pre-made cards, each containing 15 cards. So, the total number of cards she initially had is:
20 (made) + 2 * 15 (pre-made) = 20 + 30 = 50 cards

She gave away 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, so the total number of cards she gave away is:
24 + 5 = 29 cards

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards she has after giving away 29 cards:
50 (initial cards) - 29 (given away) = 21 cards

She received 17 cards from family and friends. So, the total number of cards she now has is:
21 (cards left) + 17 (received) = 38 cards

The final answer is: 38"
"To find out how many slices are left, we need to first calculate the total number of slices given to Bill and Mark. 

Bill gets 1/3 of the pizza, which is (1/3) * 12 = 4 slices.
Mark gets 1/4 of the pizza, which is (1/4) * 12 = 3 slices.

The total number of slices given away is 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny eats 2 slices, so the number of slices left is 12 - 7 - 2 = 3 slices.

"To determine how many days Mark needs to save his money, we need to divide the cost of the bike by the amount he earns per day.

Cost of the bike: $300
Daily earnings: $10

Number of days needed to save: $300 / $10 = 30

Mark needs 30 days to save enough money to buy the bike."
"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs first.

Number of spiders = 90
Number of millipedes = 1/3 * 90 = 30

Number of stink bugs = 2 * 30 - 12 = 48

Total number of bugs = Number of spiders + Number of millipedes + Number of stink bugs
= 90 + 30 + 48
= 168

The final answer is: 168"
"To find the difference in age between Alice and Erica, we need to first find the ages of Alice and Beth. 

Since Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years younger than Erica, Beth's age is 30 - 5 = 25 years.

Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice's age is 25 + 7 = 32 years.

The difference in age between Alice and Erica is 32 - 30 = 2 years.

"To find the total calories consumed, we need to multiply the number of glasses by the number of ounces per glass and then multiply by the calories per ounce.

Number of glasses = 2
Ounces per glass = 8
Calories per ounce = 3

Total calories = Number of glasses * Ounces per glass * Calories per ounce
Total calories = 2 * 8 * 3
Total calories = 48

"To calculate the builder's yearly earnings, we need to first calculate his weekly earnings and then multiply it by the number of weeks he works in a year.

The builder works 6 days a week and gets paid $50 per day. So, his weekly earnings are 6 * $50 = $300.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, his yearly earnings would be 52 * $300 = $15,600.

The final answer is: $15,600"
"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of each ingredient required for the quadruple batch.

For the quadruple batch, Mark needs 4 times the amount of the normal recipe. 

For flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
For milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs to buy 12 / 2 = 6 bags of flour.

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark needs to buy 4 / 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour: 6 - 2 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the total energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days. 

First, we calculate the daily energy usage: 
900 watts/hour * 8 hours = 7200 watts/day

Now, we calculate the total energy used in 30 days: 
7200 watts/day * 30 days = 216,000 watts

Since 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts, we convert the total energy to kilowatts: 
216,000 watts / 1000 = 216 kilowatts

Now, we calculate the new daily energy usage after reducing the time by 5 hours: 
900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watts/day

The new total energy usage in 30 days: 
2700 watts/day * 30 days = 81,000 watts

Now, we calculate the energy saved: 
216,000 watts - 81,000 watts = 135,000 watts

Converting the energy saved to kilowatts: 
135,000 watts / 1000 = 135 kilowatts

"To find the average number of stripes, we need to first find the total number of stripes. 

There are two zebras with 17 stripes each, so that's 2 * 17 = 34 stripes. 
There's one zebra with 36 stripes. 
The last zebra has half the number of stripes of the first two, so it has 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Now, we add up all the stripes: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras: 88 / 3 = 29.33.

The average number of stripes is 29.33."
"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we need to calculate the total amount of each required for 20 people.

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and each sandwich serves 4 people, we can calculate the total amount of each needed for 20 people as follows:

- Meat: 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches
  Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat, we need 5 pounds of meat.
- Cheese: 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches
  Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of cheese, we need 5 pounds of cheese.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese:

- Cost of meat: 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
- Cost of cheese: 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

$50.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in his house.

We know that Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, we can set up an equation to find the number of corns:

Let's denote the number of corns as C. Since there are twice as many corns as cannolis, we can write:

C = 2 * 40
C = 80

Now, we know that Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is:

40 + 60 = 100 cannolis

We also know that he bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. So, the new total number of corns is:

100 - 40 = 60 corns

Now, we can find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis:

Total = 80 (corns) + 100 (cannolis)
Total = 180

The final answer is: 180"
"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first calculate the total steps he completed before the jog. 

He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. He also did 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, the total steps completed before the jog is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. To find out how many steps he took during the jog, we subtract the remaining steps from the total steps completed before the jog. 

Steps taken during the jog = Total steps completed before the jog - Remaining steps
Steps taken during the jog = 6,000 - 2,000
Steps taken during the jog = 4,000

"To find out how many minutes it will take Toby to finish the book, we need to calculate the total number of words in the book and then divide it by his reading rate.

The book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page, so the total number of words is 45 * 200 = 9000 words.

Toby can read 300 words per minute, so the time it will take him to finish the book is 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes.

Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 10 minutes to get there, so he will arrive at the airport 60 - 10 = 50 minutes after he finishes the book.

Since it will take him 30 minutes to finish the book, he will arrive 50 - 30 = 20 minutes early.

The final answer is: 20"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. So, the total amount paid to the employees in May is:

40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours/week = $24,000

Since the number of employees remains the same in June, the company hired 40 employees again. However, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees left. 

The remaining employees in June are 40 - 10 = 30 employees. The total amount paid to the employees in June is:

30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours/week = $18,000

The total amount paid to the employees in the two months is the sum of the amounts paid in May and June:

$24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds, and the first pound is full price ($3), the second pound is half off ($3 * 0.5 = $1.50). So the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50, and the magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1. So the total cost of the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1 = $2.50.

Now, let's add the cost of the taffy and the seashells and magnets to find the total cost of the items Sally purchased. $4.50 + $2.50 = $7.

Finally, let's subtract the total cost from the amount of money Sally had initially. $10 - $7 = $3.

Sally has $3 left."
"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks first. 

The first package costs $400. The second package is worth twice that much, so it costs 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packages, so the discount amount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.2 * $1200 = $240.

The discounted cost of the two packages is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Adding the cost of the finale firework, the total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine the number of dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she needs for 30 days. Since she eats 2 cookies per night, she will need 2 * 30 = 60 cookies for 30 days.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she needs (60) by the number of cookies her recipe makes (12). 

60 / 12 = 5

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days."
"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to consider the intersection of the two events. 

First, we know that 5% of the candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. This means 5% of 50,000 candles will have this defect. 

5% of 50,000 = 0.05 * 50,000 = 2,500 candles

However, we are also told that these candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode. This means that 1% of the candles with the wet dog smell defect will explode. 

1% of 2,500 = 0.01 * 2,500 = 25 candles

Therefore, 25 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to calculate the discount amount and then subtract it from the regular price of the blouses.

First, we need to find the discount amount. Since Misha picks out 4 blouses and the discount is 30%, we can calculate the discount amount as follows:

Discount amount = 30% of $20
= 0.3 * $20
= $6

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the discounted blouses by subtracting the discount amount from the regular price of the blouses:

Total cost = Regular price - Discount amount
= $20 - $6
= $14

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is $14.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as T, the number of apples from the shortest trees as S, and the number of apples from the average trees as A.

We know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so T = 30.

We also know that Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so S = 30/2 = 15.

We know that Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2T = 2(30) = 60 apples from the tallest trees.

We also know that Joanne's sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so her sister gathers 3S = 3(15) = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

Since Joanne's sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees, the total number of apples gathered by Joanne's sister is 60 + 45 = 105 apples.

We know that the combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so the total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 500 - 105 = 395 apples.

We know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees and 15 apples from the shortest trees, so the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 395 - 30 - 15 = 350 apples.

The final answer is: 350"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, the total number of bumps can be represented as 2C + D = 304.

We also know that the total number of heads is 180, and since each animal has one head, we can write the equation C + D = 180.

Now we have two equations:

1) 2C + D = 304
2) C + D = 180

We can solve these equations simultaneously. Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1), we get:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute C into equation (2) to find the number of dromedaries:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.

"To find the total distance Tom traveled, we need to break it down into parts.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.

For the next 2 days, he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers.

So, the total distance covered in the first 6 days is 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers.

On the 7th day, Tom wasn't traveling at all, so the distance covered on that day is 0 kilometers.

During the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total distance covered in the second week is 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, we add the distances covered in the first 6 days and the second week: 1040 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

Therefore, Tom traveled a total of 3140 kilometers during his two-week-long trip.

"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can set up the equation:

Peter's locker = 1/4 * Zack's locker
5 = 1/4 * Zack's locker

To solve for Zack's locker, we can multiply both sides by 4:

Zack's locker = 5 * 4
Zack's locker = 20 cubic inches

Now that we know Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches, we can find Timothy's locker, which is half as big as Zack's locker:

Timothy's locker = 1/2 * Zack's locker
Timothy's locker = 1/2 * 20
Timothy's locker = 10 cubic inches

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the original price of the jogger jeans. 

Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the original price of the tattered jeans is x + 6.

We know that Cole saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. This means he saved 1/3 of the difference between the original price of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans, and 2/3 of the difference between the original price of the tattered jeans and the jogger jeans.

The total savings is $6, so we can set up the equation:

(1/3)(x - (x + 6)) + (2/3)((x + 6) - x) = 6

"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and add them together.

- 4 buses with a capacity of 60 employees each can hold 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
- 6 minibusses with a capacity of 30 employees each can hold 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
- 10 minivans with a capacity of 15 employees each can hold 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, let's add the capacities of all vehicles together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

Therefore, a total of 570 employees can join the day trip.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder. 

Let's denote the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders as x. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is x + 10.

We know that Lillian builds 3 homemade feeders and buys 3 store-bought feeders. So, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10), and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x.

Since the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same, we can set up the equation:

3(x + 10) = 3x

Expanding the equation, we get:

3x + 30 = 3x

Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get:

30 = 0

This equation is not true, which means that the initial assumption that the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same is incorrect. However, we can still solve for x.

Let's re-examine the problem. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, we can set up the equation:

3(x + 10) = 3x + 30

Expanding the equation, we get:

3x + 30 = 3x + 30

This equation is true, which means that the initial assumption is correct. However, we can still solve for x.

Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get:

30 = 30

This equation is true for any value of x, but we can still find the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders. Since the store-bought feeders attract x birds each, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x.

"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The bagel costs $4. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, so the soup costs $4 + (25% of $4) = $4 + $1 = $5.

The cake is half the price of the bagel, so the cake costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: $4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much money Kenny has after selling the cards. We know he has $50 in spending cash and he plans to use the rest of the money to buy a ticket to the amusement park. 

Since the ticket costs $100, Kenny must have $100 - $50 = $50 left from selling the cards. 

We know that he sells the cards for $1.5 each and he has $50 left. To find out how many cards he sold, we can divide $50 by $1.5.

$50 / $1.5 = 33.33

Since we can't sell a fraction of a card, we'll round down to 33 cards.

Now, we know Kenny sold 33 cards. We also know that he kept 1/3 of his original collection. To find the total number of cards he started with, we can set up an equation:

Let x be the total number of cards Kenny started with.

He sold 33 cards, so he has 2/3x - 33 cards left.

We know he has $50 left, so 2/3x - 33 = 50.

To solve for x, we can add 33 to both sides:

2/3x = 83

To isolate x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 83 * 3/2
x = 124.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a card, we'll round up to the nearest whole number.

x = 125

The final answer is 125."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of hotdogs the caterer prepared. Since the caterer prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs, we can calculate the total number of hotdogs as follows:

Total number of guests = 36
Number of guests who would have had two hotdogs = 36 / 2 = 18
Total number of hotdogs prepared = 18 * 2 = 36

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means the caterer had to provide 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs in total.

Since the caterer prepared 36 hotdogs, which is less than the required 80 hotdogs, we can conclude that the caterer did not have enough hotdogs for everyone to get a second hotdog.

To find the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog, we can subtract the number of hotdogs prepared from the total number of hotdogs needed:

Number of hotdogs needed = 80
Number of hotdogs prepared = 36
Number of guests who did not get a second hotdog = 80 - 36 = 44

However, this is the number of guests who were initially supposed to have two hotdogs. Since the caterer prepared enough for 18 guests to have two hotdogs, we need to subtract this number from the total number of guests who did not get a second hotdog:

Number of guests who did not get a second hotdog = 44 - 18 = 26

Therefore, 26 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is: 26"

Since her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, we add 4 to 3, which equals 7. 

Now, we need to add the number of letters in Indras' name (6) to the number of letters in her sister's name (7). 

6 + 7 = 13

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then apply the 20% discount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- Utensils (5): 5 * $5.00 = $25.00
- Total cost: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Now, we need to apply the 20% discount. To do this, we'll calculate 20% of the total cost and subtract it from the total cost.

20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

So, Charlotte's order would cost $132.00 after the 20% discount."
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and subtract the amount of money she already has.

The total cost of the items is: $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19

Dora has $2 (from her allowance) + $16 (from her mother) = $18

To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1

The final answer is: $1"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of dragons each prince slew.

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, so he slew 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so he slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so he slew 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

Therefore, Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons.

"To find out how many gallons Josey needed, we need to calculate 1/4 of 15 gallons. 

1 gallon is equal to 8 pints. So, 1/4 of 15 gallons is (1/4) * 15 = 3.75 gallons.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints, we can convert 3.75 gallons to pints by multiplying 3.75 by 8. 

3.75 * 8 = 30 pints.

Therefore, Josey needed 30 pints of gasoline.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George spent on chips. Since each bag of chips costs 40 cents and he bought 3 bags, the total cost of chips is 3 * 40 = 120 cents.

George started with $5, which is equivalent to 500 cents. After spending 120 cents on chips, he had 500 - 120 = 380 cents left. Since he had 1% of his money left, we can set up the equation:

1% of 500 = 0.01 * 500 = 5 cents

This means he had 5 cents left. So, the amount he spent on candy bars is 380 - 5 = 375 cents.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can divide the total amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar to find the number of candy bars:

375 / 75 = 5

Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends. 

First, we need to find out how many lollipops Ray shared with his friends. He had 25 lollipops initially and kept 5 for himself. 

25 (initial lollipops) - 5 (lollipops kept) = 20 lollipops shared

Now, we divide the shared lollipops by the number of friends: 

20 (shared lollipops) / 4 (number of friends) = 5 lollipops per friend

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the two pieces that Rory and her mom each have from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of the cake = 20 ounces
Number of pieces = 8
Number of people who have a piece = 2

Weight of the pieces = 20 / 8 = 2.5 ounces per piece

Weight of the two pieces = 2.5 * 2 = 5 ounces

Weight of the remaining cake = Weight of the cake - Weight of the two pieces
Weight of the remaining cake = 20 - 5
Weight of the remaining cake = 15 ounces

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"To find the total number of people sharing the oranges, we need to add Sitti and Juris to the 6 friends, which gives us a total of 8 people.

Now, we need to divide the total number of oranges (34 + 22 = 56) by the total number of people (8).

56 ÷ 8 = 7

So, everyone will get 7 oranges."
"To find the total cost of the ingredients, we first need to calculate the total amount of onions and beef stock needed.

Antoine needs 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. Since each pound costs $2.00, the total cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, each costing $2.00, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

Since Antoine's soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes Bernadette to drive to the theater and then calculate how much earlier she should leave.

Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to drive to the theater, the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to drive to the theater, Bernadette should leave 4 + 5 = 9 minutes before Wayne.

However, we also need to consider the time it takes Bernadette to drive to the theater. Since it takes her 16 minutes to drive to the theater, she should leave 16 + 9 = 25 minutes before Wayne.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 25 minutes before Wayne to arrive at the theater first.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we can convert 3 yards to feet by multiplying 3 by 3.

3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now that we have the length in feet, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:

Area = Length * Width
360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of Billie's room is 98 feet."
"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads each one bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Elizabeth has:
1 (red) + 2 * 20 (clear) = 1 + 40 = 41 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Margareth has:
3 (blue) + 4 * 20 (red) = 3 + 80 = 83 beads

Now, to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has:
83 (Margareth) - 41 (Elizabeth) = 42

The answer is 42."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the change in temperature due to the oven and the window.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour, and it's on for 3 hours. So, the total temperature increase due to the oven is 5 * 3 = 15 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the window. The window cools down the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes it's open, and it's open for 30 minutes. So, the total temperature decrease due to the window is 2 * (30/10) = 6 degrees.

Now, we need to add the temperature increase due to the oven and subtract the temperature decrease due to the window. The initial temperature is 40 degrees. 

Final temperature = Initial temperature + Temperature increase due to oven - Temperature decrease due to window
Final temperature = 40 + 15 - 6
Final temperature = 49 degrees.

The final temperature of the house is 49 degrees."
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the time it took Jon to complete the entire triathlon. 

Jon's total time = swim time + bike time + run time
Jon's total time = 40 minutes + 1 hour 20 minutes + 50 minutes
Jon's total time = 40 + 80 + 50
Jon's total time = 170 minutes

Since James finishes the swim 10% faster, we need to calculate James' swim time.
James' swim time = Jon's swim time - (10% of Jon's swim time)
James' swim time = 40 - (0.1 * 40)
James' swim time = 40 - 4
James' swim time = 36 minutes

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike, so we need to calculate James' bike time.
James' bike time = Jon's bike time + 5 minutes
James' bike time = 1 hour 20 minutes + 5 minutes
James' bike time = 80 + 5
James' bike time = 85 minutes

Now, we know James' swim time and bike time. We can calculate James' total time.
James' total time = James' swim time + James' bike time + James' run time
We are given that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time.
James' total time = Jon's total time + 10 minutes
James' total time = 170 + 10
James' total time = 180 minutes

Now, we can calculate James' run time.
James' run time = James' total time - James' swim time - James' bike time
James' run time = 180 - 36 - 85
James' run time = 59 minutes

The final answer is 59."
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then the length of Movie A.

We know that Movie C was 1.25 hours, which is equivalent to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Since Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C, its length is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, so its length is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is 20."
"To find out how much hay the horse eats, we need to calculate the distance the horse runs. Since the horse runs at 32 miles per hour and runs for 30 minutes, we first need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

30 minutes is 0.5 hours. 

Now, we can calculate the distance the horse runs: 
Distance = Speed * Time 
Distance = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours 
Distance = 16 miles 

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs, and a bail of hay costs $3, the total cost of the hay is:
Cost = Distance * Cost per mile 
Cost = 16 miles * $3/mile 
Cost = $48 

Michael has six $5 bills, so he has a total of $30. 
Change = Total money - Cost 
Change = $30 - $48 
Change = -$18 

Since Michael can't have a negative amount of money, this means he doesn't have enough money to buy the hay."
"To find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total, we need to calculate the number of eggs in the cases and the loose eggs. 

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs is 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass needs 5 eggs, so we divide the total number of eggs by 5 to find out how many glasses she can fill. 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays Rozanne can put out. 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many points Joey is winning, we need to calculate the difference between his final score and Marcy's final score.

Joey's initial score: 214 points
Joey's score after scoring 26 points: 214 + 26 = 240 points
Marcy's initial score: 225 points
Marcy's score after scoring 10 points: 225 + 10 = 235 points

Now, we subtract Marcy's final score from Joey's final score to find the difference:
240 - 235 = 5 points

Joey is winning by 5 points.

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's calculate the revenue from selling 17 sneakers at $20 each:
17 sneakers * $20 = $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling the remaining sneakers at $25 each. There were 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left.
31 sneakers * $25 = $775

Total revenue = $340 + $775 = $1115

Now, let's calculate the profit:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $1115 - $576
Profit = $539

The salesman's profit is $539."
"To find the total number of colors Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of colors in each type of packet and then add them together.

Six packets had eight colors each, so the total number of colors in these packets is 6 * 8 = 48.

Four packets had sixteen colors each, so the total number of colors in these packets is 4 * 16 = 64.

Now, we add the total number of colors from both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112.

Therefore, Beatrice bought 112 colors of crayons in all.

112"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as P and the regular price of a soda as S. 

The cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and a soda at regular price is 12 + P + S.

The cost of buying a super ticket is 20 + 1 (for the popcorn) = 21.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and a soda at regular price is $2 more than the cost of the super ticket. 

So, we can set up the equation: 12 + P + S = 21 + 2.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 12 + P + S = 23.

We know that the cost of a soda is $3, so S = 3.

Substituting S = 3 into the equation, we get: 12 + P + 3 = 23.

Simplifying the equation, we get: P + 15 = 23.

Subtracting 15 from both sides, we get: P = 8.

Therefore, the regular price of popcorn is $8.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the original cost of filling one balloon. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as x. Since the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, we can set up the equation:

20x = 900

Dividing both sides by 20, we get:

x = 900 / 20
x = 45

So, the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20, so the new cost of filling one balloon is:

45 + 20 = 65

Now, we need to find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price. We can multiply the new cost of filling one balloon by 170:

65 * 170 = 11,100

Therefore, Bentley paid $11,100 to fill 170 balloons after the price increase."
"To find the average speed of the car, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Distance = Speed * Time
For the first part of the trip, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours, so the distance covered is:
Distance1 = 60 * 2 = 120 miles

For the second part of the trip, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance covered is:
Distance2 = 30 * 1 = 30 miles

Total distance = Distance1 + Distance2 = 120 + 30 = 150 miles

Total time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 150 / 3 = 50 mph

The car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."
"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she received in the trade.

Initially, Jenna had 8 sapphires worth $800. After trading 3 sapphires, she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left, which are worth 5 * $800 = $4000.

She received 2 rubies in the trade, which are worth 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is the sum of the value of the sapphires and the rubies: $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

"To find the total number of apples eaten by Marin and Nancy in 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of apples each of them eats in 30 days and then add them together.

Marin eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, he eats 4 * 30 = 120 apples.

Nancy also eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, she eats 4 * 30 = 120 apples.

The total number of apples eaten by both Marin and Nancy in 30 days is 120 + 120 = 240 apples.

"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds. 

The volume of one raised bed is calculated as length * width * height = 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost will be 160 * 12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of cards, we first need to calculate the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of green cards = Number of red cards + (60% of the number of red cards)
= 15 + (0.6 * 15)
= 15 + 9
= 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards. So, the number of yellow cards is:

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards:

Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

The final answer is: 78"

Now, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. 
3 + 4 = 7 puppies with spots.

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we divide the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100.

                     = 240

3. Calculate the number of pencils left at the end of the year:
   Pencils left at the end of the year = 1/3 * Remaining pencils
                                     = 1/3 * 240
                                     = 80

The number of pencils left at the end of the year is 80."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. 

Since Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, and he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra, we can write the equation as:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we need to first calculate the total length of the remoras and then divide it by the length of the shark.

The length of the remoras is 2 * 6 inches = 12 inches. 

Since there are 12 inches in 1 foot, we can convert the length of the remoras to feet by dividing by 12: 12 inches / 12 = 1 foot.

Now, we can find the total length of the remoras in feet: 1 foot (remoras) + 1 foot (shark) = 2 feet.

To find the percentage, we divide the total length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100: (2 feet / 10 feet) * 100 = 20%.

The combined length of the remoras is 20% of the shark's body length."
"To find the total number of students at that grade level, we can start by using the information that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer. Let's denote the total number of students as 'x'. 

Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, the number of students with a desktop computer is (3/4)x. The remaining one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We are given that this one-fourth is equal to 20 students. 

We can set up the equation: (1/4)x = 20

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction: x = 20 * 4
x = 80

So, there are 80 students at that grade level.

"To find out how long Jason needs to walk each day, we need to divide the total time it takes to break in the shoes (240 minutes) by the number of days he has to break them in (3 weeks).

First, we need to convert the number of weeks to days. There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is equal to 3 x 7 = 21 days.

Now, we can divide the total time (240 minutes) by the number of days (21):

240 minutes / 21 days = 11.43 minutes per day

So, Jason needs to walk approximately 11.43 minutes each day to break in the new shoes.

"To find out how many books each child received, we need to first determine the total number of books Sarah bought. 

Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can divide the total amount spent by the cost of each book to find the total number of books:

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost per book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by the number of kids to find out how many books each child received:

Number of books per child = Total number of books / Number of kids
Number of books per child = 20 / 4
Number of books per child = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to first find the total number of kids who are allergic to at least one substance. 

We know that 9 kids are allergic to dairy, 6 are allergic to peanuts, and 3 are allergic to both. To avoid double-counting the kids allergic to both, we need to subtract the number of kids allergic to both from the sum of the kids allergic to dairy and peanuts. 

So, the total number of kids allergic to at least one substance is 9 (dairy) + 6 (peanuts) - 3 (both) = 12.

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything: 32 (total kids) - 12 (kids allergic to at least one substance) = 20.

"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets, the hotel, and add them together.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 per person, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. To find the increased price, we need to calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.2 * $1500 = $300. The increased price is $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel, which is $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

"To find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to calculate the number of tubes of blue paint and yellow paint he has.

Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint. Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, so Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so Jasper has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

Therefore, Jasper has 2 tubes of blue paint and 9 tubes of yellow paint, for a total of 2 + 9 = 11 tubes of paint.

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to determine the weight of the 2010 penny. Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight as follows:

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * Weight of 1959 penny
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48 grains
Weight of 2010 penny = 36 grains

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their individual weights:

Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny
Combined weight = 48 grains + 36 grains
Combined weight = 84 grains

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how much more they need to earn, we need to calculate the total amount they have already earned and subtract it from their goal.

Keegan earned $83 and Tashay earned $91, so together they have earned $83 + $91 = $174.

"To find the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to calculate the number of oranges he ate and multiply it by the cost per orange.

Stetson ate 2/5 of the oranges, and they picked 60 oranges. 

First, we need to find 2/5 of 60. To do this, we multiply 60 by 2 and divide by 5.

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5
= 120 / 5
= 24

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges.

Since Stetson gave up $10 for each orange, we multiply the number of oranges he ate by the cost per orange.

24 * 10 = 240

Therefore, Stetson gave up a total of $240.

"To determine the total amount of oats needed, we first need to calculate the daily consumption of oats by the horses. Since each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal and is fed twice a day, the total daily consumption per horse is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds.

With four horses, the total daily consumption is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

Since Uncle Ben wants to feed his horses for five days, the total amount of oats needed is 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how many bags of oats are required to meet this demand. Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats. To find the number of bags needed, we divide the total amount of oats required (200 pounds) by the weight of oats in each bag (50 pounds).

200 / 50 = 4

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

"To find the cost of each individual razor, we first need to calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors. 

Since each pack costs $4.00 and they are on sale for buy one get one free, we can get 2 packs for the price of 1 pack. 

So, the total cost of 2 packs is $4.00. 

Now, we subtract the $2.00 coupon from the total cost: $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since we are asked to find the cost of each individual razor, we need to divide the total cost by 4 (the number of razors in a pack). 

$2.00 / 4 = $0.50 per pack. 

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, we multiply the cost per pack by 4 to find the cost of each individual razor: 

$0.50 * 4 = $2.00. 

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: 

$2.00 * 100 = 200 cents.

"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the number of insects each person found. Let's say Bodhi found x insects. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found x/2 insects. 

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found x/2 + 7 insects.

We are also given that the total number of insects collected is 43. So, we can set up the equation:

x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms:

2x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects Lily found:

Lily found x/2 + 7 = 18/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

Now, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. To find 3/5 of $80, we multiply $80 by 3/5, which is $80 * 3/5 = $48.

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Rob to shingle a house in minutes. Since Rob takes 2 hours, we can convert this to minutes by multiplying by 60.

2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. So, we can set up an equation:

Time taken by Royce = 2 * Time taken by Rob + 40

Substituting the value of Time taken by Rob (120 minutes), we get:

Time taken by Royce = 2 * 120 + 40
Time taken by Royce = 240 + 40
Time taken by Royce = 280 minutes

Therefore, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house.

"To find the total number of skeins needed, we need to calculate the total number of items for the triplets and then multiply each item by the number of skeins required.

For each triplet, Martha needs:
- 1 hat: 2 skeins
- 1 scarf: 4 skeins
- 1 sweater: 12 skeins
- 1 pair of mittens: 1 pair = 2 skeins
- 1 pair of socks: 2 skeins

Total items per triplet: 2 + 4 + 12 + 2 + 2 = 22 items

Since there are 3 triplets, the total number of items needed is 22 * 3 = 66 items.

Now, we multiply the total number of items by the number of skeins required for each item:
- Hats: 66 * 2 = 132 skeins
- Scarves: 66 * 4 = 264 skeins
- Sweaters: 66 * 12 = 792 skeins
- Mittens: 66 * 2 = 132 skeins
- Socks: 66 * 2 = 132 skeins

Total skeins needed: 132 + 264 + 792 + 132 + 132 = 1320 skeins

"To find out how many problems Chris has left to complete, we need to calculate the number of problems he completed each day and subtract that from the total.

On Monday, Chris completed 12 problems.

On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, so he completed 3 * 12 = 36 problems.

The total number of problems completed so far is 12 + 36 = 48.

The total number of problems is 100. So, the remaining problems are 100 - 48 = 52.

On Wednesday, Chris completed one-quarter of the remaining problems, which is 1/4 * 52 = 13 problems.

The number of problems left to complete on Thursday is 52 - 13 = 39.

The final answer is 39."
"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour, we need to calculate the individual rates of each person and then add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.
Kathy picks twice as many quarts per hour as Bobby, so Kathy picks 5 * 2 = 10 quarts per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, so Ricky picks 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, we add the individual rates together: 6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29 quarts per hour.

"To find the total number of rows, we need to divide the total number of each color of tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row.

For red tulips: 36 / 6 = 6 rows
For blue tulips: 24 / 8 = 3 rows

Since the number of rows for each color is different, we need to find the limiting factor, which is the smaller number of rows. In this case, the blue tulips will limit the number of rows to 3.

The total number of rows will be 3.

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we first need to calculate her current weekly consumption and the new total consumption after adding the device.

Current daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
Current weekly consumption: 12 kilowatts/hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatt-hours
Current weekly bill: 84 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $126

New daily consumption: 12 kilowatts/hour + 2 kilowatts/hour = 14 kilowatts/hour
New weekly consumption: 14 kilowatts/hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatt-hours
New weekly bill: 98 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $147

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $147 - $126 = $21."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the rate at which one person paints the house. Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can calculate the rate as follows:

Rate = 1 house / 5 days = 1/5 house per day

Now, we need to find the rate at which 5 people paint the house. Since the rate is additive, we can multiply the individual rate by 5:

Combined rate = 5 * (1/5) = 1 house per day

Since the combined rate is 1 house per day, it will take 5 people 1 day to paint a whole house.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of chairs Ophelia has. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, and Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can set up an equation to represent the relationship between the number of chairs and sofas.

Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as 'x'. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna has 3x chairs. We are also given that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so Ophelia has x - 2 sofas.

We know Ophelia has 20 sofas, so we can set up the equation: x - 2 = 20.

Solving for x, we get x = 22.

Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Now, we can find the total number of sofas and chairs by adding the number of sofas and chairs: 20 (sofas) + 66 (chairs) = 86.

The total number of sofas and chairs is 86."
"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he hadn't purchased the headphone set, we need to first determine how many CDs he could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set.

Since Tom spent $48 in total and $4 on the CD, the amount he spent on the headphone set is $48 - $4 = $44.

Now, we need to find out how many CDs he could have bought with $44. Since each CD costs $4, we can divide $44 by $4 to get the number of CDs:

$44 ÷ $4 = 11

So, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he hadn't purchased the headphone set.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the total hours for the weeks he worked out 4 hours a week and the weeks he worked out 5 hours a week.

For the weeks he worked out 4 hours a week, there are 6 weeks (8 weeks - 2 weeks with 5 hours). 
Total hours for these weeks = 6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 24 hours

For the weeks he worked out 5 hours a week, there are 2 weeks.
Total hours for these weeks = 2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours

For the week he worked out 6 hours, there is 1 week.
Total hours for this week = 1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours

Now, we add the total hours for all the weeks:
Total hours = 24 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours = 40 hours

The total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is 40 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events step by step.

Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, leaving 48 - 8 = 40 passengers.

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get on the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40 passengers. Now, there are 40 + 40 = 80 passengers.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, leaving 80 - 21 = 59 passengers.

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus compared to the number who got off (21), which is 21 / 3 = 7 passengers. Now, there are 59 + 7 = 66 passengers.

Therefore, after the second stop, there are 66 passengers riding the bus.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jame's current age be x.

In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5) + 5 = x + 10 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 10 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 10 = 2x + 5

Subtracting x from both sides:

10 = x + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

5 = x

So, Jame's current age is 5 years.

Now, let's find Jame's cousin's current age. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be x + 10 = 5 + 10 = 15 years old.

The age difference between Jame and his cousin is 15 - 5 = 10 years.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we first need to find the total cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can calculate the cost of the printer as follows:

Cost of printer = Cost of computer - $400
Cost of printer = $1,100 - $400
Cost of printer = $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer is $2,400. We can subtract the cost of the printer from the total cost to find the total cost of the two monitors:

Total cost of monitors = Total cost - Cost of printer
Total cost of monitors = $2,400 - $700
Total cost of monitors = $1,700

Since there are two monitors, we can divide the total cost of the monitors by 2 to find the cost of one monitor:

Cost of one monitor = Total cost of monitors / 2
Cost of one monitor = $1,700 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $850

The final answer is: $850"
"To find the number of seashells brought by each girl, we first need to determine the total number of seashells brought by the girls. 

Since the boys brought 60 shells each and there are 20 boys, the total number of shells brought by the boys is 60 * 20 = 1200.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This can be expressed as 1200 + 4 * 60.

First, calculate four times the number of shells brought by the boys: 4 * 60 = 240.

Now, add this to the number of shells brought by the boys: 1200 + 240 = 1440.

Since there are 10 girls, to find the number of seashells brought by each girl, divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by 10: 1440 / 10 = 144.

The final answer is 144."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy adds $5 to his share, making his total $6 + $5 = $11. The next day, he adds another $10, making his total $11 + $10 = $21.

He then spends $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

He then saves some more money and triples the amount he had left after spending the $8. This means he now has 3 times the amount he had after spending $8, which is 3 * $13 = $39.

So, the eldest boy now has $39.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know Elvis has a monthly target of $1125. Since there are 30 days in April, we can calculate the total amount he needs to save in the first half of the month.

Let's assume Elvis saves x dollars per day in the first half of the month. Then, he saves 2x dollars per day in the second half of the month.

The total amount he saves in the first half of the month is 15x (15 days), and the total amount he saves in the second half of the month is 15(2x) = 30x.

Since Elvis's total monthly target is $1125, we can set up the equation:

15x + 30x = 1125

Combine like terms:

45x = 1125

Divide both sides by 45:

x = 25

So, Elvis saves $25 per day in the first half of the month.

Now, we need to find out how much he saves per day in the second half of the month. Since he saves 2x dollars per day in the second half, we multiply x by 2:

2x = 2(25) = 50

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 per day in the second half of the month.

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she spent reading in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Now, we know that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes, we can divide 105 by 1.5 to get the number of 1.5-minute intervals, which is 70. Then, we multiply this number by 2 to get the total number of pages she read in the first week: 70 * 2 = 140 pages.

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week (140) to the pages read in the second week (100): 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find out how many sandwiches are left, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor.

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which is 1/3 of 12. 
1/3 of 12 is 4 sandwiches.

Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which is 1/4 of 12. 
1/4 of 12 is 3 sandwiches.

The total number of sandwiches eaten is 4 + 3 = 7.

To find the number of sandwiches left, we subtract the total eaten from the initial amount: 
12 - 7 = 5

There are 5 sandwiches left."
"To solve this problem, let's denote Shiloh's current age as S and his nephew's current age as N. 

We are given that Shiloh is 44 years old today, so S = 44.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be S + 7, and his nephew's age will be N + 7. According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This can be expressed as:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44 into the equation:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

10 = N

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth earned $3.00 each, the amount for the last two teeth is (1/2) * $3.00 = $1.50 per tooth. For two teeth, that's 2 * $1.50 = $3.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon: $5.00 + $3.00 + $3.00 = $11.00.

The final answer is: $11.00"
"To find the number of goals scored by each teenager, we can start by determining the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna.

Since Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, and Richie scored 80 goals, we can set up an equation to find the number of goals scored by Mark:

Mark's goals = Richie's goals - 20
Mark's goals = 80 - 20
Mark's goals = 60

Since Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, we can set up another equation to find the number of goals scored by Anna:

Anna's goals = Richie's goals - 45
Anna's goals = 80 - 45
Anna's goals = 35

Now that we know the number of goals scored by each teenager, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three:

Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how much Mitchell made, we need to multiply the number of lemonades he sold by the price of each lemonade. 

Number of lemonades sold by Mitchell = 21
Price of each lemonade = $4

Total amount Mitchell made = Number of lemonades sold * Price of each lemonade
Total amount Mitchell made = 21 * $4
Total amount Mitchell made = $84

Now, we need to find out how much more Mitchell made than Liam. 

Liam's earnings = $63
Mitchell's earnings = $84

Difference in earnings = Mitchell's earnings - Liam's earnings
Difference in earnings = $84 - $63
Difference in earnings = $21

The final answer is: $21"
"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate the number of action figures he bought each day and then add them up.

Peter has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week. Since there are 7 days in a week, he will spend $10 per day.

From Sunday to Wednesday, he buys wooden action figures which cost $5 each. So, he buys 3 wooden action figures per day. 
3 * 5 = 15 wooden action figures

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he buys plastic action figures which cost $2 each. So, he buys 5 plastic action figures per day.
5 * 2 = 10 plastic action figures per day
10 * 3 = 30 plastic action figures

Total wooden action figures = 15
Total plastic action figures = 30
Total action figures = 15 + 30 = 45

Peter will have 45 action figures by the end of the week.

"To find the total cost of the kitten, we need to add the cost of spaying, the cost of the vaccines, and the cost of the broken vases.

The cost of spaying is $200.
The cost of the vaccines is 3 * $20 = $60.
The cost of the broken vases is 4 * $12 = $48.

Now, let's add these costs together: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

The total cost of the kitten so far is $308."
"To determine the total number of roses Ford needs to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the shops per week and then multiply it by 4 (since there are 4 weeks in a month).

The total number of roses ordered per week is: 
20 (first shop) + 15 (second shop) + 30 (third shop) = 65 roses

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is: 
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Ford grows 40 roses every week. To find out how many roses he lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows in a month from the total number of roses ordered per month:
260 roses/month - 40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month

Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To find the remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes from the account in that time period.

Since Katina removes $100 every month, we can calculate the total amount removed in 2 years as follows:

$100/month * 12 months/year = $1200/year
$1200/year * 2 years = $2400

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the account:

$3000 - $2400 = $600

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her savings account.

$600"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

Total revenue = Number of sandwiches sold * Price per sandwich
Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00 per sandwich
Total revenue = $70.00

Total cost = Cost of bread per loaf * Number of loaves used + Cost of cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches
Since each loaf makes 10 sandwiches, the number of loaves used is equal to the number of sandwiches sold, which is 10.
Total cost = $3.00 per loaf * 10 loaves + $30.00
Total cost = $30.00 + $30.00
Total cost = $60.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $60.00
Net profit = $10.00"
"To find out how many muffin crayons Kate can make, we need to first determine how many crayons she has. Since she has 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of crayons per box.

3 boxes * 64 crayons/box = 192 crayons

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one muffin, we need to divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find out how many muffins she can make.

192 crayons / 8 crayons/muffin = 24 muffins

Now, we can multiply the number of muffins by the selling price per muffin to find out how much money Kate can make.

24 muffins * $1.50/muffin = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total area of the room, then calculate the cost of the carpet, padding, removal, and installation.

The area of the room is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the carpet is 216 square feet * $12 per square foot = $2592.

The cost of the padding is 216 square feet * $2 per square foot = $432.

The cost of removal is 216 square feet * $4 per square foot = $864.

The cost of installation is 216 square feet * $34 per square foot = $7344.

The total cost is $2592 (carpet) + $432 (padding) + $864 (removal) + $7344 (installation) = $10512.

"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to calculate the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide it by the number of days.

Let's break down the number of birds Mack saw each day:
- Days 1 and 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Days 4 and 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

There are 7 days in a week. 

Average number of birds per day = Total number of birds / Number of days
= 280 / 7

"To find the correct temperature, we need to calculate the percentage difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature. 

The actual temperature is 468, and the set temperature is 450. The difference is 18 degrees. 

To find the percentage difference, we divide the difference by the set temperature and multiply by 100: 
(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Since the oven is off by the same percentage for any recipe, we need to find the temperature that is 4% higher than the set temperature. 

To do this, we multiply the set temperature by 1.04 (1 + 0.04): 
450 * 1.04 = 468

However, the actual temperature is 468, so we need to find the temperature that is 4% lower than the actual temperature. 
468 * 0.96 = 447.12

So, Maggie should set the oven to 447.12 degrees."
"To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to add the lengths of the two movies. 

First, we convert the lengths of the movies to minutes. 
1 hour and 30 minutes is equal to 90 minutes, and 2 hours and 5 minutes is equal to 125 minutes.

Now, we add the lengths of the two movies: 
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house value and subtract it from Herb's house value. 

Herb's house value is $76,000. 
30% of $76,000 is 0.3 * 76,000 = $22,800.

Juan's house value is $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.

The combined value of the two houses is $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200.

"To find the total number of utensils, we need to first determine the number of dishes Judy brought. Since Judy bought a dozen (12) cups and twice as many dishes, she brought 12 * 2 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of dishes is 24 (Judy's dishes) + 44 (her friend's dishes) = 68 dishes.

Since Judy brought 12 cups and her friend brought 40 cups, the total number of cups is 12 + 40 = 52 cups.

The total number of utensils (cups + dishes) is 68 (dishes) + 52 (cups) = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we first need to calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts. 

Since each box is $100.00 and there's a 10% discount, the discounted price of one box is:
$100.00 * (1 - 0.10) = $90.00

The total cost of 2 boxes is:
$90.00 * 2 = $180.00

Since 90 single-use contacts last 45 days, we can calculate the cost per day:
$180.00 / 45 days = $4.00 per day

Now, we can calculate the cost per pair of contacts:
$4.00 per day / 2 pairs per day = $2.00 per pair

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate their individual hours worked and multiply it by the hourly wage.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. 
Her earnings would be 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. 
He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. 
His total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours. 
His earnings would be 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is 40."
"To determine the total calories burned, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running separately and then add them together.

Calories burned from aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
Calories burned from running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories
Total calories burned: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we can divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times she needs to drink 100 ml of water.

Total calories burned / 200 = 1600 / 200 = 8
Since she needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she needs 8 * 100 ml of water.

8 * 100 ml = 800 ml

The final answer is: 800"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We are given that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation: B + R + G = 4500.

We are also given that the jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as: R = 0.99B.

Additionally, the jar contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as: G = 1.01B.

Substituting the expressions for R and G into the first equation, we get: B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500.

Combine like terms: 3B = 4500.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 1500.

Now that we have the value of B, we can find the values of R and G. 

R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485.

G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1509.

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, subtract R from G: 1509 - 1485 = 24.

Jared's initial speed is 47 WPM. He increases it by 5 words to get 52 WPM. To find the next increase, we subtract the initial speed from the second speed: 52 - 47 = 5. 

Now, we add this increase to the second speed to get the third speed: 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

The three measurements are 47, 52, and 57. To find the average, we add them together and divide by 3: (47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52.

The average of the three measurements is 52."

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, which is 20 feet off the ground. 

The initial height of the beanstalk is 4 feet. Since it doubles in height every day, we can calculate its height on each day as follows:

Day 1: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 2: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 3: 16 * 2 = 32 feet
Day 4: 32 * 2 = 64 feet

Since 64 feet is greater than 20 feet, the beanstalk will be taller than Mark's window on the 4th day.

"To find the total grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first calculate the grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day and each cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams, we can calculate the grams of protein per day as follows:

200 grams of mushrooms * 3 grams of protein per cup = 600 grams of protein per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to get the weekly protein intake:

600 grams of protein per day * 7 days per week = 4200 grams of protein per week

The final answer is: 4200"

Subtracting x from both sides, we get: 0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get: 10 = x

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 10 + 3 = 13

"To determine how many hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. 

The base price of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. Adding the extra cost of the porcelain crown for one of the implants, the total cost becomes $4000 + $500 = $4500. 

Since George has already put down a deposit of $600, the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Now, we can calculate the number of hours George needs to work to earn $3900 at $15 per hour. 

Number of hours = Total amount / Hourly wage

"To solve this problem, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Let's denote the smallest angle as x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, its measure is 2x. 

Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, its measure is 3x.

The sum of the three angles is 180 degrees, so we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees

3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle is 90 degrees.

He has 14 nickels, which is 14 * 5 = 70 cents.
He has 15 pennies, which is 15 * 1 = 15 cents.

Adding these amounts together, we get 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents.

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by 5 to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy: 345 / 5 = 69.

Therefore, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

For the first four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup. 
15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50/hour
$7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30

For the next two hours, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.60 per cup.
10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6/hour
$6/hour * 2 hours = $12

Total earnings = $30 + $12 = $42

The final answer is 42."
"To find out how many rotations the tire will undergo in a year, we need to first find out how many rotations it undergoes in a month. 

Since the car drives 400 miles a month and the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, we can calculate the number of rotations per mile as follows:

725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile

Now, we can find the total number of rotations in a month:

362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles = 145,000 rotations per month

To find the total number of rotations in a year, we multiply the monthly rotations by 12:

145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations/year

Now, we can divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the number of rotations it undergoes in a year to find out how many years it will last:

10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years

The tire will need to be replaced in 6 years."
"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of washings Jackie will get from 1 pump. 

Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings.

Now, we need to find the cost of 60 washings. The total cost of 120 washings is $24.00. 

Cost per washing = Total cost / Total number of washings
Cost per washing = $24.00 / 120
Cost per washing = $0.20

Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost of 1 pump = Cost per washing * 60
Cost of 1 pump = $0.20 * 60
Cost of 1 pump = $12.00

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100.
Cost of 1 pump = $12.00 * 100
Cost of 1 pump = 1200 cents

The final answer is: 1200"
"To find out how much Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then subtract the amount he has.

First, we need to calculate the discount on the shirt. The discount is 30% of the original price of the shirt, which is $25. 

Discount = 30% of $25 = 0.3 * $25 = $7.50

The discounted price of the shirt is $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

The total cost of the items is the sum of the discounted price of the shirt and the price of the shorts. 

Total cost = $17.50 + $35 = $52.50

Since sales tax is included, we need to add the sales tax to the total cost. However, the problem doesn't specify the sales tax rate. Assuming a standard sales tax rate of 8% (which is a common rate in many places), we can calculate the sales tax as follows:

Sales tax = 8% of $52.50 = 0.08 * $52.50 = $4.20

The total amount Joe needs to pay is the sum of the total cost and the sales tax.

Total amount = $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70

Since Joe has $50, he will have $50 - $56.70 = -$6.70 left after the purchase. However, since Joe can't have a negative amount, this means he won't have enough money to buy the outfit.

Final answer: $-6.70"
"To determine the total amount of butter needed, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants Juan wants to make in a week. 

Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day, and there are 7 days in a week, the total number of croissants he wants to make is:

4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can convert this to a total of:

28 dozen * 12 = 336 croissants

Now, we know that it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find the total amount of butter needed, we multiply the total number of croissants by the amount of butter needed per dozen:

336 croissants * 1/4 pound/croissant = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

Therefore, Juan will need 84 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months.

For the first 5 months, John received $100,000 per month. So, the total cost for these months is:
5 months * $100,000/month = $500,000

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the funding for the 6th month is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000, for the 7th month it's $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000, and so on.

We can calculate the funding for each of the remaining 5 months as follows:
- Month 6: $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000
- Month 7: $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000
- Month 8: $225,000 * 1.5 = $337,500
- Month 9: $337,500 * 1.5 = $506,250
- Month 10: $506,250 * 1.5 = $759,375

Now, we add up the funding for all 10 months:
$500,000 + $150,000 + $225,000 + $337,500 + $506,250 + $759,375 = $2,077,625

The total cost of John's research is $2,077,625."
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to calculate the ounces of meat each player consumed and then add them together.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak. 
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce in size, so the total ounces of beef tips consumed is 8 ounces.
The third player ate a 1-pound steak, which is equal to 16 ounces (1 pound = 16 ounces).
The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Now, let's add the ounces of meat consumed by the first three players: 6 ounces + 8 ounces + 16 ounces = 30 ounces.

The total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to calculate the total number of days in March. March has 31 days.

Since each member posts an average of 3 posts per day, we can multiply the number of members by the number of posts per day and the number of days in March.

Total posts = Number of members * Posts per day * Number of days in March
Total posts = 1000 * 3 * 31
Total posts = 93,000

The total number of posts in the group in March will be 93,000."
"To calculate the total amount Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to first calculate the total gallons of water used per week, then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

Gary does laundry twice a week, and each load uses 20 gallons of water. So, the total gallons of water used per week is 2 * 20 = 40 gallons.

There are 52 weeks in a year. Therefore, the total gallons of water used in a year is 40 * 52 = 2080 gallons.

A gallon of water costs $0.15. To find the total cost, we multiply the total gallons used by the cost per gallon: 2080 * $0.15 = $312.

The final answer is: $312."

The cost of 3 pieces of coral is 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.
The cost of 20 fish is 20 * $0.50 = $10.00.
The cost of fish food is $2.00.

Now, let's add all the costs together: $10.00 + $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00 = $33.00.

Scarlett spent $33.00 in total."
"To find the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks, we need to calculate its height at the end of each week and then add them together.

At the end of the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.

At the end of the second week, it doubled in height, so it became 3 * 2 = 6 inches tall.

At the end of the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so its total height became 6 + 4 = 10 inches.

Therefore, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 weeks.

"To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to first calculate the total amount of meat Prince sells in a day. 

Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, so the total amount of meat he sells in a day is 15kg * 10 hours = 150kg.

Now, we need to divide the total weight of the bull (750kg) by the amount of meat Prince sells in a day (150kg) to find out how many days it will take him to sell the entire bull.

750kg / 150kg per day = 5 days.

"To find the total number of seats in the auditorium, we first need to find the total number of seats. 

There are 4 rows of seats, and each row has 18 seats. So, the total number of seats is 4 * 18 = 72.

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators. One-fourth of 72 is 72 / 4 = 18. So, 18 seats were occupied by administrators.

The remaining seats are 72 - 18 = 54.

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents. One-third of 54 is 54 / 3 = 18. So, 18 seats were occupied by parents.

The remaining seats are 54 - 18 = 36. These seats were occupied by students.

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is 36.

"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we need to first calculate the total number of street lights at all intersections. 

Since each intersection has 4 street lights and there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is 4 * 4 = 16.

However, 20 street lights are not functioning. To find the number of functioning street lights, we subtract the non-functioning ones from the total number of street lights: 16 - 20 = -4. 

Since we cannot have a negative number of functioning street lights, we need to re-evaluate the problem. 

Let's re-examine the problem. If 20 street lights are not working, it means that 20 street lights are not functioning. This implies that the total number of street lights is more than 20. 

Let's re-calculate the total number of street lights. Since 20 street lights are not working, the total number of functioning street lights is 20 + 20 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"

The cost per hour is $125, so the total cost is 24 * 125 = $3000.

The final answer is: $3000"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of gum Jim chews throughout the day.

First, let's calculate the number of pieces of gum Jim chews at school. Since he chews 1 piece for every 2 hours, and the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

Next, let's calculate the number of pieces of gum Jim chews on the way home from school and after dinner. He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 1 + 1 = 2 pieces.

Now, let's add up the total number of pieces of gum Jim chews throughout the day: 4 (at school) + 2 (on the way home and after dinner) = 6 pieces.

Since Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum, we subtract the total number of pieces he chews: 20 - 6 = 14.

Finally, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, so we divide the remaining gum by 2: 14 / 2 = 7.

Therefore, Jim has 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb per second to Mb per second. 

Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can divide her speed by 1000 to get her speed in Mb per second: 
20 kb/second / 1000 = 0.02 Mb/second

Now, we need to convert her speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour. 
Multiply her speed in Mb per second by 3600 to get her speed in Mb per hour: 
0.02 Mb/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 72 Mb/hour

On the remaining days (4 days), the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed on these days is:
6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Now, we add the total number of cars towed on both sets of days to get the overall total:
30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

The total number of cars towed that week is 54."
"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to subtract his current height from the required height and then divide by his annual growth rate.

First, convert Adam's current height from inches to feet: 40 inches / 12 inches per foot = 3.33 feet.

Now, subtract his current height from the required height: 4 feet - 3.33 feet = 0.67 feet.

Since he grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this to feet: 2 inches / 12 inches per foot = 0.17 feet per year.

Now, divide the difference in height by his annual growth rate: 0.67 feet / 0.17 feet per year = 3.94 years.

So, it will take approximately 4 years for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To find James' earnings, we need to calculate the profit first. 

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars, so they paid 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500 per car. 

The profit per car is the selling price minus the cost: $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

James got a 10% commission on the profits, so his commission is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made $17,500."
"To find the number of riders who can stay upright on the wave, we first need to find the total number of riders who can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. 

Given that 25% of the riders can stay upright, we can calculate this as 25% of 100, which is 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders.

Since 60% of these riders are women, we can find the number of women who can stay upright by calculating 60% of 25, which is 0.6 * 25 = 15 women.

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright: 25 - 15 = 10 men.

The final answer is 10."
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to first find the prices of the gold and silver jewels.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can find the price of the gold jewel. Since the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate it as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

Now, we know that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold. So, we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we have the prices of all three jewels: diamond ($2000), gold ($1600), and silver ($1200). To find the total price, we add the prices of all three jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond + Price of gold + Price of silver
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The total price for all three jewels is $4800."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of truck stamps and rose stamps Max bought.

We know that Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so the number of truck stamps is 16 + 3 = 19.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so the number of rose stamps is 19 - 9 = 10.

Now, we can find the total number of stamps by adding the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps: 16 + 19 + 10 = 45.

The final answer is 45."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the relative speed between Bob and Tom. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed to get the relative speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph
Relative speed = -15 mph

However, since speed cannot be negative, we take the absolute value of the relative speed.

Relative speed = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Relative speed

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can find out how many fish Tommy caught. Since Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, we can calculate Tommy's catch as follows:

Darren's catch + 3 = Tommy's catch
11 + 3 = 14

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the total cost of the classes and then subtract the maximum amount they are willing to pay ($10 per class) from that total.

The total cost of the classes is $60. 

Since Manny's parents won't sign him up again if the cost exceeds $10 per class, we need to find out how many classes he can afford to miss before the total cost exceeds $100 (10 classes * $10 per class).

Let's calculate the number of classes Manny can miss:

Total cost of classes = $60
Maximum cost per class = $10
Number of classes = 10

To find the maximum number of classes Manny can afford to miss, we can subtract the total cost from the maximum cost:

Maximum number of classes Manny can afford to miss = Maximum cost per class * Number of classes - Total cost of classes
= $10 * 10 - $60
= $100 - $60
= $40

Since Manny can afford to miss 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price of the truck.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade is $7,500.

Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, we add the cost of each feature to the base price of the truck:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab upgrade) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000

Distance = 10 miles/hour * 2.5 hours
Distance = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances biked by Alisa and Stanley to find the total distance:
Total Distance = Alisa's Distance + Stanley's Distance
Total Distance = 54 miles + 25 miles
Total Distance = 79 miles

The total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles.

"To find the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay.

Time to dig through soil = Total soil depth / Rate of digging through soil
Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours

Time to dig through clay = Total clay depth / Rate of digging through clay
Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / (1/2) feet/hour = 8 * 2 = 16 hours

Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 16 hours = 22 hours

The total time it will take Bill to dig the well is 22 hours."
"To find the total number of cupcakes Howie needs to buy, we need to calculate the number of cupcakes for himself, his teacher, and his classmates.

Howie wants 2 cupcakes for himself, 2 cupcakes for his teacher, and 2 cupcakes for each of his 25 classmates. 

First, we calculate the number of cupcakes for his classmates: 25 classmates * 2 cupcakes = 50 cupcakes.

Now, we add the cupcakes for Howie, his teacher, and his classmates: 2 (Howie) + 2 (teacher) + 50 (classmates) = 54 cupcakes.

So, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes.

"To find the initial number of likes, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the initial number of likes as x. 

Since the number of likes after three weeks is 70 times the initial number, we can write the equation as follows: 
x + 2000 + 20000 = 70x

Combine like terms: 
20000 + 2000 = 70x - x 
22000 = 69x

Now, divide both sides by 69: 
x = 22000 / 69 
x = 319.45 (round down to 319 since we can't have a fraction of a like)

Now that we know the initial number of likes, we can find the total number of likes. 
Total likes = initial likes + 2000 + 20000 
Total likes = 319 + 2000 + 20000 
Total likes = 21919"
"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on both days.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got $2 off. So, the total cost on Tuesday is:
20 pomegranates * $20 = $400
$2 discount = $400 - $2 = $398

On Wednesday, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each, but the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. So, the total cost on Wednesday is:
20 pomegranates * $30 = $600
10% discount = $600 * 0.10 = $60
$60 discount = $600 - $60 = $540

Now, we can find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days:
$398 - $540 = -$142

The negative sign indicates that Clara paid less than Sheila."
"To find the total amount Ariadne made in the first month, we need to determine the sales of green hats. 

Let's denote the sales of green hats as G. Since the sales of red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, we can set up the equation:

400 = 0.5G

To find G, we multiply both sides by 2:

G = 400 * 2
G = 800

So, the sales of green hats in the first month were $800.

Now, we need to find the total sales for the first month. We add the sales of red and green hats:

Total sales in the first month = 400 + 800
Total sales in the first month = 1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. We can calculate this as:

Total sales in the second month = 3/4 * 1200
Total sales in the second month = 900

Now, we add the total sales of both months to find the total amount she made in two months:

Total sales in two months = 1200 + 900
Total sales in two months = 2100

The final answer is: 2100"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of paid hours and multiply it by the cost per hour.

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so the number of paid hours is 4 - 1 = 3 hours.

The cost of the first paid hour is $15. Each subsequent hour is twice the cost, so the cost of the next two hours is 2 * $15 = $30 each.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the first hour and the cost of the next two hours: $15 + $30 + $30 = $75.

The final answer is 75."
"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to subtract the amount she has in her bank account from her expected wage.

Expected wage: $300
Current bank balance: $420

Withheld amount = Expected wage - Current bank balance
Withheld amount = $300 - $420
Withheld amount = -$120

Since the withheld amount cannot be negative, we need to consider the initial deposit and the current balance. 

Initial deposit: $200
Current balance: $420

Total amount in the bank: Initial deposit + Current balance
Total amount: $200 + $420 = $620

Since Sally's expected wage is $300, the amount withheld is the difference between the total amount in the bank and her expected wage.

Withheld amount = Total amount - Expected wage
Withheld amount = $620 - $300
Withheld amount = $320

The amount withheld from Sally's wage is $320."
"To determine the number of eggs needed, we first need to calculate the total number of deviled egg halves required. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves and there are 16 guests, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is 3 * 16 = 48.

Since each egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2 to find the total number of eggs required. 48 / 2 = 24.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can convert 24 eggs to dozens by dividing by 12. 24 / 12 = 2.

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs for her party.

24"
"To find out how many pages Shiela has left to write, we need to subtract the number of pages she has already written from the total number of pages required.

Total pages required = 15
Pages already written = 1/3 of 15 = 5

Pages left to write = Total pages required - Pages already written
= 15 - 5
= 10

She has 10 pages left to write."
"To determine how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read per day.

Total pages = 200
Pages per day = 10

Number of days = Total pages / Pages per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we subtract the number of days it will take him to finish the book from the deadline.

Days before deadline = Deadline - Number of days
= 30 - 20
= 10

Therefore, Mike will finish the book 10 days before the deadline."
"To calculate the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly rent, and the monthly fuel cost.

The initial cost of the plane is $150,000.

The monthly rent is $5000, so the annual rent is $5000 * 12 = $60,000.

The monthly fuel cost is twice the monthly rent, so the monthly fuel cost is $5000 * 2 = $10,000. The annual fuel cost is $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

The total cost for the first year is the sum of the initial cost, the annual rent, and the annual fuel cost: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the cooking time for the pork and then the beans. 

Since it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice, and it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

The cooking time for beans is half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. So, the combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Therefore, the cooking time for beans is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we can find the total cooking time by adding the cooking times for all three items: 30 (rice) + 50 (pork) + 40 (beans) = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost of the mixture, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture separately.

For the first mixture: 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts
Cost of almonds: 1/2 * $10 = $5
Cost of walnuts: 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the first mixture: $5 + $5 = $10

For the second mixture: 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts
Cost of almonds: 1/5 * $10 = $2
Cost of walnuts: 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the second mixture: $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
Difference = Cost of the first mixture - Cost of the second mixture
= $10 - $7
= $3

The final answer is: $3"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. 

Since each sheep has 1 head and each goose has 1 head, the total number of heads is the sum of the number of sheep and geese: s + g = 20.

Each sheep has 4 legs, and each goose has 2 legs. The total number of legs is 70, so we can set up another equation: 4s + 2g = 70.

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by 2 to get 2s + 2g = 40, then subtracting it from the second equation to eliminate 'g'. 

(4s + 2g) - (2s + 2g) = 70 - 40
2s = 30
s = 15

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the coffee. Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee and uses 1 pound per day, he needs 7 pounds of coffee. 

The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but the more expensive brand costs 20% more. To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we need to calculate 20% of $5 and add it to $5. 

20% of $5 is 0.2 * $5 = $1. 
The cost of the more expensive brand is $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Since Roger needs 7 pounds of coffee, the total cost of the coffee is 7 * $6 = $42.

Adding the cost of the coffee and the donut, the total cost is $42 + $2 = $44.

The final answer is: $44"
"To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to subtract the total cost of the items Gus bought from the total amount he spent. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought: 
2 bags of chips for $2.00 each = 2 * $2.00 = $4.00
Adding the cost of the bucket of fried chicken ($8.00) and the bottle of soda ($1.00), we get: $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Now, subtracting the total cost of the items from the total amount spent: $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

Therefore, the apple pie cost $7.00.

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered - (Newspapers delivered to District A + Newspapers delivered to District C)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - (198 + 209)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 407
Newspapers delivered to District B = 193

"To find the total number of recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total class time and then divide it by the time it takes to learn a new recipe.

Total class time = Number of classes * Class duration
Total class time = 4 classes/week * 2 hours/class
Total class time = 8 hours/week

Since the class meets for 6 weeks, we multiply the total class time by the number of weeks:
Total class time = 8 hours/week * 6 weeks
Total class time = 48 hours

Now, we divide the total class time by the time it takes to learn a new recipe (1.5 hours):
Number of recipes = Total class time / Time to learn a new recipe
Number of recipes = 48 hours / 1.5 hours
Number of recipes = 32

"To find the number of math teachers, we need to calculate 100% - 60% of the total number of teachers. 

100% - 60% = 40%

Now, we multiply the total number of teachers by the percentage of math teachers to find the number of math teachers.

40% of 150 = 0.4 * 150 = 60

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours they sleep.

60 * 6 = 360

The total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money each person has. 

We know that Aurelia has $120. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * Aurelia's money
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * $120
Kassidy's money = $90

We also know that Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's money as follows:
Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + $60
Rayna's money = $90 + $60
Rayna's money = $150

Now, we need to find the total amount of money they have together. 
Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
Total money = $120 + $90 + $150
Total money = $360

To find out how much each person would have if they share the total money equally, we divide the total money by 3.
Money per person = Total money / 3
Money per person = $360 / 3
Money per person = $120

Christina recorded 8 good days, 8 bad days, and 8 neutral days, making a total of 8 + 8 + 8 = 24 days. 

Since there are 30 days in the month, we subtract the 24 days that have been recorded from the total number of days in the month to find the remaining days: 30 - 24 = 6.

Since the next three days are good, we need to subtract these from the remaining days: 6 - 3 = 3.

Now, we need to isolate 'x'. To do this, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 18 / 2

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we know the bamboo grows 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we can divide the target height (600 inches) by the growth rate (30 inches/day).

600 inches / 30 inches/day = 20 days

Therefore, it will take 20 days for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, James had 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he had 1 toy per dog. 

When he left, there were 8 more dogs in the shelter, making a total of 4 + 8 = 12 dogs. Since each dog needs one toy, James needed 12 toys.

However, when he came back, there were twice as many dogs as when he left, which means there were 2 * 12 = 24 dogs. Since 3 dogs were gone, there were 24 - 3 = 21 dogs left.

Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 21 toys in total.

"To find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we need to set up a proportion. 

Let's assume that the ratio of potatoes to hash browns is constant. We know that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns. 

So, the ratio of potatoes to hash browns is 6:36 or 1:6. 

Now, we can set up a proportion to find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes:

6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

6x = 36 * 96
6x = 3456
x = 3456 / 6
x = 576

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

Now that we know Max has 73 cookies, we can find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has by subtracting 12 from Max's total: 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Finally, we can find the total number of cookies by adding up the number of cookies each person has: Katarina (68) + Max (73) + Cookie Monster (61) = 202 cookies.

The total number of cookies is 202."
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to work backwards from the final length. 

Let's denote the original length of the dress as x. 

Since the dress was extended by 50% of its original length, the new length is x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

We also know that the final length of the dress is 140cm, which is the result of adding 20cm to the extended length. 

So, we can set up the equation: 1.5x + 20 = 140.

Now, we can solve for x: 
1.5x = 140 - 20
1.5x = 120
x = 120 / 1.5
x = 80

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

"To find the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the time it took him to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode.

Since Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour in ""turtle"" mode, he can mow half the lawn in 0.5 hours. 

Converting 0.5 hours to minutes, we get 0.5 * 60 = 30 minutes.

In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. So, he can mow half the lawn in 40 / 2 = 20 minutes.

Now, we add the time it took to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode: 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

Therefore, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the age of the younger twin as 'x'. Since there is one set of twins, the age of the older twin would be 'x + 7'. 

We also know that there is a set of triplets, so we'll denote the age of the youngest triplet as 'y'. The ages of the other two triplets would be 'y + 1' and 'y + 2'. 

The combined ages of the twins and the triplets are given as 44. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 7) + y + (y + 1) + (y + 2) = 44

Combine like terms:

2x + 3y + 10 = 44

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x + 3y = 34

Now, we need to find integer values of x and y that satisfy this equation. Since x is the age of a twin and y is the age of a triplet, both x and y should be non-negative integers.

Let's try different values of y to find a suitable solution. 

If y = 4, then 3y = 12, and 2x = 22. Solving for x, we get x = 11.

So, one of the twins is 11 years old.

"To find the total number of coins Rong has saved, we need to calculate the total number of months he has been saving. Since Rong has been saving for 10 years, and there are 12 months in a year, he has been saving for 10 * 12 = 120 months.

Rong saves 20 coins per month, so the total number of coins he has saved is 20 * 120 = 2400.

Now, let's calculate the number of coins Neil saves per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

The total number of months Neil has been saving is also 120 months. So, the total number of coins Neil has saved is 28 * 120 = 3360.

To find the total number of coins they have saved together, we add the total number of coins Rong and Neil have saved: 2400 + 3360 = 5760.

The final answer is: 5760"
"To find out how much John leaves with, we need to calculate the total cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. 

The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so we need to find 60% of the total cost. Let's denote the total cost as x. The equation for the heartworm check is 0.6x. 

Since the total cost is the sum of the cost of vaccines and the heartworm check, we can write the equation as: x = $40 + 0.6x. 

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40. 

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100. 

The total cost is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of the total cost, so the heartworm check is 0.6 * $100 = $60. 

The total cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check is $40 + $60 = $100. 

John brought $125, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25."
"To find the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

First, we know that one banana costs twice as much as an apple, and one apple costs $0.5. So, one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

We also know that oranges are three times as expensive as bananas. Therefore, one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each type of fruit in the crate:

- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Adding these costs together, we get the total price of the crate: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

The final answer is: $32"
"To find the total number of squares, we need to determine the number of each color. 

We know there are 14 red squares. Since there are 4 more blue squares than red squares, there are 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.

There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so there are 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.

There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so there are 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, we can find the total number of squares by adding the number of squares of each color: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

68"
"To find the number of regular chairs, we need to multiply the number of high chairs by 5, since the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. 

Number of high chairs = 8
Number of regular chairs = 8 * 5 = 40

Total number of people attending = 42 adults + 15 babies = 57

Since the total number of chairs required is 57, and there are 40 regular chairs, the number of additional chairs needed is:

Additional chairs needed = Total number of people - Number of regular chairs
= 57 - 40
= 17

The restaurant needs 17 more chairs."
"To find the number of 8-point bucks, we need to calculate 20% of the total number of bucks.

First, we find the total number of bucks: 50 * 0.5 = 25 bucks.

Then, we calculate 20% of the total number of bucks: 25 * 0.2 = 5.

So, there are 5 eight-point bucks."
"To find the total points collected by the students, we need to calculate the points for each student.

Adam has 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 
30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15.
So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. 
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by all the students: 
Adam + Betty + Marta + Tom = 50 + 65 + 105 + 35 = 255 points.

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the minimum threshold:
400 - 255 = 145 points.

The class is missing 145 points to go on the trip."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of great grand-babies. 

Great Grandma Jones has 3 children. Each of her children has 3 children, so the number of grandchildren is 3 * 3 = 9. 

Each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 babies, so the number of great grand-babies is 9 * 3 = 27.

Therefore, there will be 27 great grand-babies for Great Grandma Jones to kiss.

"To find out how much money Greta has left to spend, we need to calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account and the amount she uses for her car payment.

First, we calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account: 
50% of $2400 = 0.5 * $2400 = $1200

Next, we calculate the amount she uses for her car payment: 
20% of $2400 = 0.2 * $2400 = $480

Now, we subtract the amount she puts into her retirement account and the amount she uses for her car payment from her total paycheck:
$2400 - $1200 - $480 = $720

Greta has $720 left to spend.

720"
"To find the number of pairs of pencils in the box, we need to first determine the total number of pencils in the box. 

Since there are 20 spaces for pencils and 4 are missing, the total number of pencils in the box is 20 - 4 = 16.

A pair of pencils consists of 2 pencils. To find the number of pairs, we divide the total number of pencils by 2.

Number of pairs = Total number of pencils / 2

The final answer is 8."
"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks from the city display and the number of fireworks she sets off in her backyard.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks from the city display. There are 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from the city display is 15 * 20 = 300.

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to find 40% of 300. To do this, we multiply 300 by 0.4, which gives us 300 * 0.4 = 120.

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah sets off in her backyard. She sets off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks from her backyard is 3 * 5 = 15.

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the number of fireworks from the city display and her backyard: 120 + 15 = 135.

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the total amount of money spent on snacks and drinks, we need to calculate the total number of drinks and snacks purchased.

There are 14 people in total (Aiden and his 12 friends, plus the 7 additional friends). Each person buys 2 drinks and 3 snacks. 

Total number of drinks = 14 * 2 = 28 drinks
Total number of snacks = 14 * 3 = 42 snacks

Since each drink and snack costs $2, the total cost of drinks and snacks is:
Total cost = (Total number of drinks * Cost per drink) + (Total number of snacks * Cost per snack)
Total cost = (28 * 2) + (42 * 2)
Total cost = 56 + 84
Total cost = 140

The group has spent $140 on snacks and drinks."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much gravel Gissela's truck can carry. 

Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

The total capacity of the three trucks combined is 11,600 pounds. We know that Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds and Gordy's truck can carry 4,800 pounds. 

So, the total capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds.

Now, we subtract this from the total capacity of the three trucks to find out how much Gary's truck can carry: 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

2,800"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many dumplings each male ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

We know there are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

We also know there are 6 females, and each female ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females must be equal to the total number of dumplings Larry cooked. Therefore, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is 32 (males) + 18 (females) = 50.

"To find out how much money Gerald had left, we first need to determine the total parts in the ratio, which is 3 + 2 = 5. 

Since Gerald spent $10, we can find out how much money he had initially by multiplying the total amount ($100) by the ratio of his part (3/5). 

Gerald's initial amount = (3/5) * 100 = 60

Now, we subtract the amount he spent from his initial amount to find out how much he has left.

Gerald's remaining amount = 60 - 10 = 50

The final answer is 50."
"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. 

Speed of the cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we can find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

The turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we need to first determine the amount they still need to raise, which is the difference between their goal and the amount already raised.

Amount already raised = $2100
Goal = $6300
Amount still needed = Goal - Amount already raised
= $6300 - $2100
= $4200

Since they raise an equal amount in every hour, we can divide the amount still needed by the hourly rate to find the number of hours they need to fundraise.

Hourly rate = Amount already raised / Number of hours already worked
= $2100 / 3
= $700 per hour

Now, we can divide the amount still needed by the hourly rate to find the number of hours they need to fundraise.

Number of hours needed = Amount still needed / Hourly rate
= $4200 / $700
= 6 hours

Therefore, the firefighters need to fundraise for 6 more hours to reach their goal.

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city, and then subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes.

The city uses 40% of the river's water. Since 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes, we can find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes by subtracting 80% from 40%.

First, we need to convert 40% to a decimal: 40% = 0.4

Then, we subtract 80% from 0.4: 0.4 - 0.8 = -0.4

However, since we cannot have a negative percentage, we need to convert 0.4 to a percentage and subtract 80% from it. 

0.4 = 40% 

Now, subtract 80% from 40%: 40% - 80% = -40%

Since we cannot have a negative percentage, we need to subtract 80% from 100% instead. 

100% - 80% = 20%

So, the city uses 20% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

"To find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we need to first determine the rate of production for each type of ice cream.

The chocolate ice cream factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours, so its rate of production is 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour.

The vanilla ice cream factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, so its rate of production is 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we can calculate the total number of quarts made in 48 hours by adding the production of both types of ice cream:

Chocolate ice cream production in 48 hours: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla ice cream production in 48 hours: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts
Total production in 48 hours: 2400 quarts + 600 quarts = 3000 quarts

The total number of quarts made in 48 hours is 3000."
"To calculate Marcus' total bill, we need to first find the total cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The total cost of the croissants is 5 * $3.00 = $15.00.
The total cost of the cinnamon rolls is 4 * $2.50 = $10.00.
The total cost of the mini quiches is 3 * $4.00 = $12.00.
The total cost of the blueberry muffins is 13 * $1.00 = $13.00.

The total cost of all the items is $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

Applying the 10% discount, the discount amount is 10% of $50.00, which is 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00.

The total bill after the discount is $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00.

"To determine the number of scoops Erin should buy, we need to calculate the total cost of the scoops she can afford with her $6.00. 

Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide the amount of money Erin has by the cost of each scoop to find out how many scoops she can buy:

$6.00 / $1.50 = 4 scoops

However, the deal is buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. This means for every 3 scoops, Erin only pays for 2. 

So, we can divide the total number of scoops she can afford by 3 to find out how many sets of the deal she can get:

4 scoops / 3 scoops per set = 1.33 sets

Since Erin can't buy a fraction of a set, she can buy 1 set of the deal, which includes 3 scoops. 

Therefore, Erin should buy 3 scoops of ice cream.

"To find out how much candy each person has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total amount of candy they eat in that time period.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days (two weeks), she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces of candy.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces of candy.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy have 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces of candy, and Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces of candy.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract the amount Ginger has from the amount Amy has: 58 - 44 = 14.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid, we first need to find the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. Since the price increased by 10%, we need to calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70

New price of each computer = Original price + Increase in price
= $700 + $70

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company paid by multiplying the new price of each computer by the number of computers.

Total amount paid = New price of each computer * Number of computers
= $770 * 500
= $385,000

The total amount of money the company paid to buy the computers at the new prices is $385,000."

"To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the potential damage it could cause to his car.

The potential damage to Ron's car is $450. 

The cost of fixing the pothole himself includes the cost of the asphalt (3 buckets * $25 per bucket = $75) and the fine he would have to pay to the city council ($120). 

So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $75 (asphalt) + $120 (fine) = $195.

To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we subtract the total cost of fixing the pothole from the potential damage to his car: $450 (potential damage) - $195 (total cost of fixing the pothole) = $255.

"To find out how many slices of pizza were left, we need to calculate the total number of slices first. Since there are 5 people, including Bryce, and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 2 friends, they ate 2 * 2/3 = 4/3 of the total pizza. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 4/3 by 12: (4/3) * 12 = 16 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 friends, they ate 2 * ¾ = 1 ½ pizzas. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 1 ½ by 12: 1.5 * 12 = 18 slices.

Now, we need to subtract the slices eaten by all five friends from the total number of slices. The total slices eaten is 16 + 18 = 34 slices. Subtracting this from the total number of slices, we get 60 - 34 = 26 slices.

"To find the average time the cat and dog take to eat the sausages, we first need to calculate the time it takes for each to eat the sausages.

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. 

The dog eats the same number of sausages (9) in 2/3 the time it takes the cat. 
So, the dog eats 9 sausages in (2/3) * 30 minutes = 20 minutes.

Now, we need to find the average time. To do this, we add the time taken by the cat and the dog and divide by 2.

Average time = (30 minutes + 20 minutes) / 2
Average time = 50 minutes / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

The average time the cat and dog take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to inches. 

First, we convert 8 feet to inches: 8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches. Then, we add the 4 inches: 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of Bobby's shoe as 'x'. 

We can set up the equation: 9x + 10 = 100.

Now, we solve for 'x': 
9x = 100 - 10
9x = 90
x = 90 / 9
x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."

30 days / 4 pieces per day = 7.5 days per pack

Since you can't buy a fraction of a pack, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure Parker has enough gum for the entire 30 days. 

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"To determine the total number of smores needed, we first calculate the number of smores for the kids and the adults separately. 

9 kids want 2 smores each, so 9 * 2 = 18 smores for the kids.
6 adults want 1 s'more each, so 6 * 1 = 6 smores for the adults.

In total, 18 + 6 = 24 smores are needed.

Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, we divide the total number of smores needed by 8 to find out how many sleeves are required: 24 / 8 = 3.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need 3 boxes of graham crackers.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to first find their individual ages.

Dora's age is given as 15 years.

Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 
So, Dora's father's age = 2 * 15 + 8 = 38 years.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. 
So, Dora's mother's age = 38 - 4 = 34 years.

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.
Total combined age = Dora's age + Dora's father's age + Dora's mother's age
= 15 + 38 + 34
= 87 years.

$20 ÷ 4 = $5

Each of Greg's siblings will get $5."
"To find the total weight of Cindy's books, we need to add the weights of all the books together. 

First, we know the weights of the math and science books are 2 pounds each, so their combined weight is 2 + 2 = 4 pounds.

The French book weighs 4 pounds and the English book weighs 3 pounds. 

The history book weighs twice as much as the English book, so it weighs 2 * 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of all the books together: 4 (math and science) + 4 (French) + 3 (English) + 6 (history) = 17 pounds.

The total weight of Cindy's books is 17 pounds.

"To find the number of votes candidate C received, we first need to calculate the number of votes candidate B received, which is 50% more than candidate A's votes. 

Candidate A received 20% of the votes, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes. 

Candidate B received 50% more than candidate A's votes, which is 20 + (0.5 * 20) = 30 votes.

Since the total number of voters is 100, the number of votes candidate C received is 100 - (20 + 30) = 50 votes.

"To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we need to calculate the difference in the number of apples they have after Boris gives Beck 10 apples.

Initially, Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

After Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck now has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

Boris now has 100 - 10 = 90 apples.

The difference in the number of apples Beck has than Boris now is 90 - 87 = 3.

"To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and subtract that from the initial 32 ounces.

For giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces per cube = 12 ounces
For medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces per cube = 14 ounces
For small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces per cube = 4 ounces

Total water used = 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces

Now, subtract the total water used from the initial amount: 32 - 30 = 2 ounces

The water Peter has left is 2 ounces."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many books Steven has. 

Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven, and Clara has 20 books, we can set up the equation: 
2 * Steven's books = 20
Steven's books = 20 / 2
Steven's books = 10

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find out how many books Alice has. 
Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so Alice has 10 + 6 = 16 books.

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract Alice's books from Clara's books: 
20 - 16 = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the cost of a half-gallon jar, we need to subtract $2 from the cost of a gallon jar. 

Cost of a gallon jar = $5
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2 = $3

Now, let's calculate the total cost of 10-gallon jars. Since a gallon jar costs $5, 10-gallon jars will cost 10 * $5 = $50.

The total cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3 = $48.

The total amount of money Cecelia spent on 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars = $50 + $48 = $98.

"To find the number of students who like to play video games, we first need to determine the number of students who like to play music. 

We know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is 2 * 5 = 10.

We also know that the total number of students is 50, and 10 like to bake and 5 like to play basketball. So, the number of students who like to play video games or music is 50 - (10 + 5) = 35.

Since the number of students who like to play music is 10, the number of students who like to play video games is 35 - 10 = 25.

The final answer is 25."
"To find the number of birds that were scared away, we need to calculate 1/3 of 12, which is 4.

The total number of birds now is 8 + 20 = 28.

The final answer is 28."
"To find the number of boys in each class, we first need to determine the total number of students in each class. Since there are two classes with the same number of students, we divide the total number of students by 2.

Total students = 80
Number of classes = 2
Students per class = Total students / Number of classes
Students per class = 80 / 2
Students per class = 40

Now, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of boys, we need to find 100% - 40% = 60% of the students.

Number of girls in each class = 40% of 40
Number of girls in each class = 0.4 * 40
Number of girls in each class = 16

Now, we can find the number of boys in each class by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.

Number of boys in each class = Students per class - Number of girls in each class
Number of boys in each class = 40 - 16
Number of boys in each class = 24

The final answer is: 24"

Mark received 1 card worth $4000 and another card worth $1000, totaling $5000. 

There are 30 cards worth $50 each, so the total value of these cards is 30 * $50 = $1500.

The total value of all the cards Mark received is $5000 + $1500 = $6500.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value: $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

"To determine the cost of the first amusement park, we need to calculate the total cost for the adults and the children separately and then add them together. 

The cost for the adults at the first amusement park is 2 * $26 = $52. 
The cost for the children at the first amusement park is 2 * $12 = $24. 
The total cost for the first amusement park is $52 + $24 = $76.

To determine the cost of the second amusement park, we do the same. 
The cost for the adults at the second amusement park is 2 * $14 = $28. 
The cost for the children at the second amusement park is 2 * $10 = $20. 
The total cost for the second amusement park is $28 + $20 = $48.

To find out how much they will save by choosing the second amusement park, we subtract the cost of the second amusement park from the cost of the first amusement park. 
$76 - $48 = $28.

The family will be able to save $28 by choosing the second amusement park over the first."
"To find out how much the vendor saves per day, we need to calculate the difference in cost between the old and new vendors.

Old vendor: 500 tomatoes/day * $.5/tomato = $250/day
New vendor: 500 tomatoes/day * $.4/tomato = $200/day

The difference in cost per day is $250 - $200 = $50.

To find out how much the vendor saves per week, we multiply the daily savings by 7:

$50/day * 7 days/week = $350/week

The vendor saves $350 per week."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the number of marbles each person has.

Let's denote the number of marbles Sean has as S, Carl has as C, and Cal has as L.

We are given that Sean has 56 marbles, so S = 56.

We are also given that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, so C = 4S = 4 * 56 = 224.

Additionally, we know that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, so S = L/2. Since S = 56, we can find L by multiplying both sides by 2, giving us L = 2S = 2 * 56 = 112.

Now that we have the number of marbles each person has, we can find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined by adding their marbles: C + L = 224 + 112 = 336.

"To determine the number of groups needed, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of groups. However, the question states that 12 groups are already required, and we need to find out how many more groups are needed.

Since 54 students are to be separated into 12 groups, we can calculate the number of students per group as follows:

54 students / 12 groups = 4.5 students per group

However, since we can't have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to accommodate all the students. 

To find the total number of groups needed, we can divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

54 students / 4.5 students per group = 12 groups

Since we already have 12 groups, we need to find the difference between the total number of groups needed and the number of groups already available:

12 groups (needed) - 12 groups (available) = 0 groups

Therefore, no more groups are needed.

"To find the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends separately and then add them together.

In a 4-week month, there are 20 weekdays (4 weeks * 5 weekdays per week) and 8 weekend days (4 weeks * 2 weekend days per week). 

The number of chairs rented during weekdays in a 4-week month is 20 * 60 = 1200.

The number of chairs rented during weekends in a 4-week month is 8 * 100 = 800.

The total number of chairs rented in a 4-week month is 1200 + 800 = 2000.

Since we want to find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we multiply the total number of chairs rented in one month by 2.

Total chairs rented in two 4-week months = 2000 * 2 = 4000.

"To solve this problem, we need to track the changes in the number of bananas over time.

Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas.

Arnold stole half of the bananas, so Gunther was left with 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

The next day, Gunther added 25 bananas, so he had 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.

Arnold then stole 12 bananas, leaving Gunther with 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.

On the third day, Gunther added 6 bananas, so he had 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

Therefore, Gunther found 43 bananas in the pile.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. 
Since a small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from the trade.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. 
Since a large button is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 large buttons from the trade.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
She had 40 large stickers initially and traded 20 for large buttons, so she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left. 
Since a large button is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from the trade.

Now, let's calculate the total number of buttons she has:
- She has 27 small buttons from the first trade.
- She has 20 large buttons from the second trade.
- She has 60 small buttons from the third trade.

Total number of buttons = 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 buttons.

"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic equation. Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as x. Since the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, the number of votes in favor can be represented as 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and the sum of votes in favor and against must equal the total number of council members. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Now that we know the number of votes against the new regulation (x = 11), we can find the number of votes in favor by multiplying x by 2:

2x = 2(11) = 22

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. 11 students need size extra-small.
2. Twice as many students need size small as extra small, so 2 * 11 = 22 students need size small.
3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.
4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up the total number of shirts needed:
11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75

The total number of shirts Krissa ordered is 75."

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. 
First, we need to find the remaining people after 10 people think horse #2 will win. 
Remaining people = 50 - 10 = 40 people.

"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that one third of the Pomeranians are girls. Since there are 6 Pomeranian girls, we can set up an equation to find the total number of Pomeranians.

Let's denote the total number of Pomeranians as P. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, so we can set up the equation:

(1/3)P = 6

To solve for P, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

P = 6 * 3
P = 18

Now that we know there are 18 Pomeranians, we can use the information that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let's denote the total number of puppies as T. We can set up another equation:

(2/3)T = 18

To solve for T, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3/2:

T = 18 * (3/2)
T = 27

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies.

Since the first house needs half of the total, we can calculate it as follows: 
Total cases = 250
Cases needed by the first house = Total cases / 2 = 250 / 2 = 125

Now, we know the first house needs 125 cases. The third house needs double the amount of the first house. 
Cases needed by the third house = 2 * Cases needed by the first house = 2 * 125 = 250

Therefore, the third house needs 250 cases of shingles.

For the cars, Henry needs 4 wheels for each car. Since he needs to assemble 57 cars, the total number of wheels required for the cars is 57 * 4 = 228.

For the motorcycles, Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle. Since he needs to assemble 73 motorcycles, the total number of wheels required for the motorcycles is 73 * 2 = 146.

The total number of wheels required for both cars and motorcycles is 228 + 146 = 374.

Henry has 650 wheels in the box. To find the number of wheels left, we subtract the total number of wheels required from the total number of wheels available: 650 - 374 = 276.

The final answer is: 276"
"To calculate the discount, we need to find 20% of the original price of the laptop, which is $1000. 

20% of $1000 = 0.20 * $1000 = $200

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the final amount to be paid.

$1000 - $200 = $800

So, you have to pay $800 after the 20% discount.

$800"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how many movies are in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of movies in series = Total number of movies / 3
= 600 / 3
= 200

Now, we know that Mike can get these series for $6 each. So, the cost of the series is:

Cost of series = Number of movies in series * Cost per series
= 200 * 6
= $1200

Next, we need to find out how many remaining movies are not in series. Since 200 movies are in series, the remaining movies are:

Remaining movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies in series
= 600 - 200
= 400

Now, we know that 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, which cost $5 each. So, the number of older movies is:

Number of older movies = 40% of remaining movies
= 0.4 * 400
= 160

The cost of the older movies is:

Cost of older movies = Number of older movies * Cost per older movie
= 160 * 5
= $800

Now, we need to find the cost of the remaining movies, which are not in series and not older movies. These are the movies that are in series but not older movies. Since we already know the cost of the series, we can find the cost of the remaining movies as follows:

Cost of remaining movies = Total cost - Cost of series - Cost of older movies
= 600 * 10 - 1200 - 800
= 6000 - 2000
= $4000

Now, we can find the total cost of replacing the movies by adding the cost of the series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the remaining movies:

Total cost = Cost of series + Cost of older movies + Cost of remaining movies
= 1200 + 800 + 4000
= $5000

The final answer is: $5000"
"To find the total amount Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of peaches is 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00
The cost of plums is 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00
The cost of apricots is 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, let's add the costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to first calculate the time they spent driving. 

Since they drove for 6 hours in total, and 1.5 hours were spent hiking, the time spent driving is 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours.

Now, we know their driving speed was 50 miles per hour. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time spent driving: 50 * 4.5 = 225 miles.

The problem states that they hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of 50 miles per hour is 25 miles per hour. So, their hiking speed was 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Since they hiked for 1.5 hours, the distance covered while hiking is 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

The total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the driving distance and the hiking distance: 225 + 30 = 255 miles.

"To determine the difference in scores, we need to calculate the points earned by each player.

Let's denote Emma's points as E and Ava's points as A.

Emma's points: 
- She collects 3 more berries than Ava, so she collects 3 + 5 = 8 berries.
- She jumps on 8 fewer enemies than Ava, so she jumps on 8 - 8 = 0 enemies.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, so she finishes the level in 30 - 4 = 26 seconds.

Emma's points = 0 * 10 (for enemies) + 8 * 5 (for berries) + 26 * 30 (for time) = 0 + 40 + 780 = 820

Ava's points:
- She jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumps on 8 * 10 = 80 enemies.
- She collects 8 fewer berries than Emma, so she collects 8 - 5 = 3 berries.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so she finishes the level in 26 + 4 = 30 seconds.

Ava's points = 80 * 10 (for enemies) + 3 * 5 (for berries) + 30 * 30 (for time) = 800 + 15 + 900 = 1715

The difference between their scores is 1715 - 820 = 895.

The final answer is: 895"
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of 64 dollars.

First, we subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars: 
64 - 30 - 30 = 4

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2:
4 / 2 = 2

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of times they ride their bikes on the three usual days and the two extra days.

On the usual days, they ride thrice a day, so that's 3 times per day * 5 days = 15 times.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times per day. So, that's 6 times per day * 2 days = 12 times.

Now, we add the total number of times they ride on both types of days: 15 times + 12 times = 27 times.

Therefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times a week.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. 

Let's denote the number of white fish he bought as 'x'. Since he ended up with twice as many orange fish as white fish, the number of orange fish after buying more is 3 + x.

The total number of fish after buying more is 7 (initial fish) + x (new white fish) + 17 (new fish from the pet store). Since the total number of fish is the sum of the initial fish and the new fish, we can write the equation:

7 + x + 17 = 3 + x + 2x

Combine like terms:

24 + x = 3 + 3x

Subtract x from both sides:

24 = 3 + 2x

Subtract 3 from both sides:

21 = 2x

Divide both sides by 2:

10.5 = x

Since we can't have half a fish, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this context, it's more logical to consider that Bob bought a whole number of fish. 

Let's re-evaluate the equation: 21 = 2x. 

Divide both sides by 2:

10.5 = x

Since we can't have half a fish, we'll re-examine the equation. 

The correct approach is to consider that the number of fish must be a whole number. 

Let's re-evaluate the equation: 21 = 2x. 

Since 10.5 is not a whole number, we need to re-examine the initial setup. 

Let's re-evaluate the equation: 24 + x = 3 + 3x.

Subtract x from both sides:

"To calculate the total weekly fuel consumption, we need to first calculate the daily fuel consumption. 

Since Andy uses his car to go to work from Monday to Friday, he drives 5 miles per day for 5 days, which is a total of 5 * 5 = 25 miles per week.

Given that his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, we can calculate the weekly fuel consumption as follows:

Weekly fuel consumption = Total miles driven / Fuel efficiency
Weekly fuel consumption = 25 miles / 10 MPG
Weekly fuel consumption = 2.5 gallons

Now, we can calculate the weekly fuel cost by multiplying the weekly fuel consumption by the current price of gas:

Weekly fuel cost = Weekly fuel consumption * Price per gallon
Weekly fuel cost = 2.5 gallons * $3/gallon
Weekly fuel cost = $7.50

The final answer is: $7.50"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch, we need to calculate the amount she spent on the twenties and the quarters separately.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on the twenties. She had 10 twenties and spent 3/5 of them. 

3/5 of 10 is (3/5) * 10 = 6 twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, she spent 6 * $20 = $120 on the twenties.

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on the quarters. She had 140 quarters and spent all of them. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, she spent 140 * $0.25 = $35 on the quarters.

Now, we add the amount she spent on the twenties and the quarters to find the total amount she paid for lunch. 

$120 (twenties) + $35 (quarters) = $155

The total amount Carrie paid for lunch is $155."

"To solve this problem, we need to find the difference in temperature between the day and night, and then divide that by the amount of heat each log provides.

The temperature difference between day and night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we can divide the temperature difference by the heat provided by each log to find the number of logs needed:

12 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 2.4 logs

Since we can't burn a fraction of a log, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure the pipes don't freeze. Therefore, Carson needs to burn at least 3 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

"To find the total number of seashells brought back, we first need to determine the number of groups and the number of seashells each group brought back.

Given that 3/5 of the number of groups had members bring back seashells, and there are 90 people in total, we can calculate the number of groups as follows:

Number of groups = Total people / Group size
Number of groups = 90 / 9
Number of groups = 10

Since 3/5 of the groups had members bring back seashells, we can calculate the number of groups that brought back seashells as follows:

Number of groups with seashells = 3/5 * Number of groups
Number of groups with seashells = 3/5 * 10
Number of groups with seashells = 6

Each group brought back 2 seashells, so the total number of seashells brought back is:

Total seashells = Number of groups with seashells * Number of seashells per group
Total seashells = 6 * 2
Total seashells = 12

Number of people who got on at the first stop: 13
Number of people who got off at the second stop: 38

First, subtract the number of people who got off at the first stop: 172 - 47 = 125
Then, add the number of people who got on at the first stop: 125 + 13 = 138
Finally, subtract the number of people who got off at the second stop: 138 - 38 = 100

Therefore, there are 100 people on the train.

"To calculate Jamie's total earnings for the day, we need to break it down into two parts: her regular pay and her special pay.

First, let's calculate her regular pay for 8 hours of work:
8 hours * $20/hour = $160

Since she worked 11 hours, she worked 3 additional hours at the special rate. The special rate is 150% of her regular rate, which is 1.5 * $20 = $30 per hour.

Now, let's calculate her special pay for 3 hours:
3 hours * $30/hour = $90

Now, we add her regular pay and special pay to get her total earnings:
$160 + $90 = $250

The final answer is: $250"
"To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to calculate the number of male lions first. Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, we can divide the number of female lions by 2.

Number of male lions = Number of female lions / 2
= 12 / 2
= 6

Now, we add the number of male lions, female lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions in the enclosure.

Total number of lions = Number of male lions + Number of female lions + Number of lion cubs
= 6 + 12 + 14
= 32

The total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans and subtract it from the $50 bill.

The original price of the jeans is $40. Since they are 25% off, we need to calculate 25% of $40.

25% of $40 = 0.25 * $40 = $10

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:

$40 - $10 = $30

So, the discounted price of the jeans is $30.

Now, subtract the discounted price from the $50 bill:

$50 - $30 = $20

Therefore, Mike will have $20 left over after buying the jeans."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first calculate the total number of employees after three months. 

The company initially has 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. After one month, the total number of employees will be 200 + 20 = 220. After two months, the total number of employees will be 220 + 20 = 240. After three months, the total number of employees will be 240 + 20 = 260.

Since each employee is paid $4000 per month, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months can be calculated as follows:

Total amount = Number of employees * Salary per employee
Total amount = 260 * $4000
Total amount = $1,040,000

The final answer is: $1,040,000"
"To find the total caroling time, we need to add the time taken by each song. 

""Deck the Halls"" is sung twice, so we multiply its duration by 2: 2 * 150 = 300 seconds.
""Jingle Bells"" is sung once, so we add its duration: 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.

Therefore, the total caroling time is 540 seconds.

"To find out how much Billy earns, we need to calculate his hourly wage after the two raises. 

Billy's initial hourly wage was $10. After the first raise of $0.50, his new wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. After the second raise of $1.00, his new wage is $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Now, we can calculate Billy's total earnings for 20 hours of work: 
$11.50 * 20 = $230.

Sally's starting hourly wage is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage, so it is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. 
Sally's total earnings for 20 hours of work: 
$10.50 * 20 = $210.

To find out how much more money Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: 
$230 - $210 = $20.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the difference in cost between 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels, we need to calculate the total cost of each item and then subtract the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread.

The cost of 3 loaves of bread is 3 x $2 = $6.
The cost of 2 bagels is 2 x $1 = $2.

Now, we subtract the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread: $6 - $2 = $4.

Therefore, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels.

"To find Nikita's score, we need to calculate half of Pierson's score and then add 11 to it. 

Half of Pierson's score is 278 / 2 = 139. 
Nikita's score is 139 + 11 = 150.

To find the total score, we need to add Pierson's score and Nikita's score. 
Total score = 278 + 150 = 428.

The final answer is 428."
"To find the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately.

Number of students: 40 classes * 25 students per class = 1000 students
Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Number of teachers: 40 classes * 3 teachers per class = 120 teachers
Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

Total number of trees planted = 1000 (students) + 240 (teachers) = 1240.

The final answer is: 1240"
"To find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has, we need to add the number of each type of stuffed animal she has: 

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Since Bubbles wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up an equation to find the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she buys as 'x'. 

The total number of stuffed animals after buying 'x' goats will be 14 + x. The percentage of stuffed goats should be 30% of this total, so we can set up the equation:

( x / (14 + x) ) * 100 = 30

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by (14 + x) to get rid of the fraction:

x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side of the equation:

x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides:

0.7x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.7:

x = 6

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To find out how many hours Kris has played, we need to calculate the total hours she played in the first 2 weeks and the additional hours she played in the last week.

In the first 2 weeks, Kris played for 30 minutes (0.5 hours) every day. There are 7 days in a week, so she played for 2 weeks, which is 14 days. 
14 days * 0.5 hours/day = 7 hours

In the last week, Kris played for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so she played for 7 days. 
7 days * 2 hours/day = 14 hours

Total hours played = 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours

To earn the achievement, Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours. 
30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours

The final answer is 9."
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the relative motion of the two cars. 

Since the second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour and the first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, the relative speed between the two cars is 70 - 60 = 10 miles per hour.

The time elapsed is 2 hours. To find the distance that separates the two cars, we multiply the relative speed by the time elapsed: 

Distance = Relative Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 20 miles

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

The number of third-graders who passed is 340, and the number of fourth-graders who passed is 40. 

Since the number of fifth-graders is 400, and their pass rate is twice that of the fourth-graders, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 2 * 40 = 80.

Now, we can calculate the total number of students who passed: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460.

The total number of students in the school is 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students in the school: 460 / 1000 = 0.46 or 46%.

The final answer is 46%."
"To find the total number of square inches Milo can make with two bags of glass chips, we first need to find out how many square inches he can make with one bag. 

Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, and there are 72 chips in a bag, we divide 72 by 12 to find the number of square inches one bag can make: 72 / 12 = 6 square inches.

Since Milo has two bags, we multiply the number of square inches one bag can make by 2: 6 * 2 = 12 square inches.

Now, we need to find the length of the mosaic. Since the mosaic is three inches tall, we can find the length by dividing the total square inches by the height: 12 / 3 = 4 inches.

The final answer is 4."
"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount each group of students drank and then add them together.

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.
16 students drank 2 quarts each, so 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

Total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the initial amount of tea can be found by adding the consumed amount to the remaining amount: 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we divide by 4 (since 1 gallon = 4 quarts). So, 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and subtract the number of candies he has already sold.

Initially, Dale had 100 candies. He sold 150, but then he ordered 100 more. So, the total number of candies he has now is 100 (initial) + 100 (new order) = 200 candies.

Since he has 200 candies and he wants to sell all of them, we subtract the number of candies he has sold (150) from the total number of candies he has (200).

200 (total candies) - 150 (candies sold) = 50

Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of students on campus by the end of May.

At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students.

By the end of January, the number of students doubles, so there are 10 * 2 = 20 students.

By the end of February, the number of students doubles again, so there are 20 * 2 = 40 students.

By the end of March, the number of students doubles again, so there are 40 * 2 = 80 students.

By the end of April, the number of students doubles again, so there are 80 * 2 = 160 students.

By the end of May, the number of students doubles again, so there are 160 * 2 = 320 students.

The number of additional students who joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, is 320 - 10 = 310.

"To find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to first find the total number of branches he climbed in a week. 

Since Felix made $105 in a week, and he charges $0.25 per branch, we can divide the total amount he made by the cost per branch to find the total number of branches he climbed:

$105 / $0.25 = 420 branches

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches he climbed per day:

420 branches / 7 days = 60 branches per day

"To find the total number of petals in the vase, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add the total number of petals for each type of flower: 
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 of each type of flower, we need to subtract 1 for each type of flower from the total:
- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 15 - 1 = 14 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 24 - 1 = 23 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 20 - 1 = 19 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 42 - 1 = 41 petals

Now, let's add the total number of petals for each type of flower after dropping 1:
14 + 23 + 19 + 41 = 97 petals

The total number of petals in the vase is 97."
"To find out how many S'mores they can make, we first need to calculate the total number of marshmallows used. John made 9 S'mores and DeSean made 9 S'mores, so together they used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows.

Initially, the bag had 35 marshmallows. After using 18, they have 35 - 18 = 17 marshmallows left.

Since each S'more requires one marshmallow, they can make 17 S'mores with the remaining marshmallows.

To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we divide the remaining marshmallows by 2, since they are making S'mores together. 

17 / 2 = 8.5

Since you can't make half a S'more, we round down to 8 S'mores for each kid.

The final answer is 8."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person played and then multiply it by the cost per game.

First, let's convert 4 hours to minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time each person played:

- Jack played for 20 minutes.
- One of his friends played for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes.
- The other friend played for 10 minutes.

The friend who is significantly better played for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes.

Now, let's add up the total time played: 20 + 10 + 10 + 30 = 70 minutes.

Since Jack played for 20 minutes, the other three friends played for 50 minutes in total (70 - 20 = 50 minutes). 

Now, let's calculate the cost of the games played:

- Jack played for 20 minutes, so he spent 20 / 20 = 1 quarter.
- The other three friends played for 50 minutes, so they spent 50 / 20 = 2.5 quarters each.

The total cost is 1 (Jack) + 2.5 * 3 (other friends) = 1 + 7.5 = 8.5 quarters.

Since 1 quarter is equal to $0.25, the total cost is 8.5 * $0.25 = $2.125.

The final answer is: $2.125"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the ingredients. 

Let's denote the amount of salt as S, the amount of oil as O, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of citrus zest as Z, and the amount of sugar as G. 

We are given the following information:
1. Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so Z = F.
2. Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.
3. Tanya uses twice as much salt as zest, so S = 2Z.
4. The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so S + O + F + Z + G = 10.

We can substitute the relationships between the ingredients into the total equation:
S + O + F + Z + G = 10
Substituting S = 2Z and O = 2S, we get:
2Z + 2(2Z) + Z + G = 10
Combine like terms:
2Z + 4Z + Z + G = 10
7Z + G = 10

Since Z = F, we can substitute F for Z:
7Z + G = 10
7(F) + G = 10
7F + G = 10

Now we have two equations:
7F + G = 10
F + Z = Z (since Z = F)

We can substitute Z for F in the second equation:
F + Z = Z
F + F = F
2F = F
F = 0

Now that we know F = 0, we can substitute it into the first equation:
7F + G = 10
7(0) + G = 10
G = 10

Now that we know F = 0 and G = 10, we can find S and O:
S = 2Z
S = 2F
S = 2(0)
S = 0

O = 2S
O = 2(0)
O = 0

Since we know S = 0, we can find the amount of oil Tanya uses:
O = 2S
O = 2(0)
O = 0

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars he sells, we need to calculate 20% of 40, which is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

Now, Joe has 40 - 8 = 32 cars left after selling 20%.

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

Finally, Joe has 32 - 16 = 16 cars left after selling and giving some to his mother.

Amount raised by students = Total amount raised by charity - Amount raised by organizations
Amount raised by students = $175,000 - $50,000
Amount raised by students = $125,000

Since there are 20 students, we need to divide the amount raised by students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised.

Amount raised by each student = Amount raised by students / Number of students
Amount raised by each student = $125,000 / 20
Amount raised by each student = $6,250

"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day separately, then add them together.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes

On the second day, Sandy walked for half as many hours as the first day. So, she walked for 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

Converting this to minutes:
4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, Hunter counted 50 cars in the parking lot.

During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.

When Hunter got out of class for lunch, he realized that 1/2 of the cars had left. To find the number of cars that left, we need to calculate 1/2 of 70, which is 70 / 2 = 35.

Now, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars at that point: 70 - 35 = 35.

So, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has:

Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color and then add them together.

Let's start with the green eggs. Cindy had 5 green eggs.

Since she had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.

She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

Lastly, she had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

Therefore, Cindy had 27 eggs altogether.

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for each week.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find the production for the fourth week, we need to know the total production for the first three weeks. 

The total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, we can subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week.

50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

Therefore, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week."

Time spent doing makeup: 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes/week
Converting 90 minutes to hours: 90 minutes / 60 = 1.5 hours/week
Total time spent on TikTok activities: 8 hours + 1.5 hours = 9.5 hours/week

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the total time spent on TikTok activities by 4:
9.5 hours/week * 4 weeks = 38 hours

Britany spends 38 hours on TikTok in a month."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to first calculate the cost of the standard items and the additional items.

The standard items include 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier. However, Angela only needs 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. 

The cost of the standard items is $129.00. 

For the additional items, Angela needs 2 extra mirrors, 2 extra chandeliers, and 18 extra pictures. The cost of these additional items is 2 * $15.00 (mirrors) + 2 * $15.00 (chandeliers) + 18 * $15.00 (pictures) = $30.00 + $30.00 + $270.00 = $330.00.

The total cost is the sum of the standard items and the additional items: $129.00 + $330.00 = $459.00.

The final answer is: $459."
"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to first determine how much money Anthony has. Since Anthony has saved $10 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20, Anthony has $20 + $10 = $30.

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply Anthony's savings by 0.4. 40% of $30 is 0.4 * $30 = $12.

Since Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, we add the 40% to Anthony's savings to find Roy's total savings. $30 + $12 = $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the mountains that each person can lift. 

We know that Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. Since Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, Saskay can lift 12 inches.

Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 since there are 12 inches in a foot. 

480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance covered in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance covered in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance covered in the first 4 hours + Distance covered in the next 6 hours
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the kangaroos. Since 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours, we can calculate their combined speed as follows:

Combined speed = Total distance / Total time
Combined speed = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Combined speed = 6 hours per kangaroo

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of the kangaroos, we can calculate their combined speed as follows:

Combined speed of turtles = Combined speed of kangaroos / 2
Combined speed of turtles = 6 hours / 2
Combined speed of turtles = 3 hours

Now, we can calculate the time it will take for the four turtles to travel across the highway:

Time = Total distance / Combined speed of turtles
Time = 18 hours / 4 turtles
Time = 4.5 hours

The final answer is: 4.5"
"To find the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we need to first determine the number of dishes each of them made.

Since Kora made 20 dishes, and Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.

Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, we can find the total number of clay dishes made by all three by adding the number of dishes each of them made: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140.

The total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora is 140."
"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop and receiving the additional help from her mom.

First, let's calculate the price of the laptop after trading in her old one: 
$600 (original price) - $200 (discount) = $400

Since Erika already has some savings in her purse, let's denote the amount she has as 'x'. She also received $150 for her part-time job and $80 from her mom. 

The total amount she has now is the sum of her savings, the job pay, and the mom's contribution: x + 150 + 80

We know that she only needs $50 more to buy the laptop, so we can set up the equation: 
x + 150 + 80 = 400 + 50
x + 230 = 450

Now, let's solve for x:
x = 450 - 230
x = 220

So, Erika has $220 in her purse."
"To find out how many apple slices Adam has left, we need to calculate the total number of slices he initially had and subtract the number of slices he ate.

Adam had 3 large apples, which can be sliced into 3 pieces each, so he had 3 x 3 = 9 large slices.
He also had 5 small apples, which can be sliced into 3 pieces each, so he had 5 x 3 = 15 small slices.
In total, Adam had 9 + 15 = 24 apple slices.

Adam ate 15 slices, so to find out how many slices are left, we subtract 15 from 24: 24 - 15 = 9.

There are 9 apple slices left."
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to determine how many liters of milk one cow produces per day. 

Since the farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from 3 cows, we divide 5 liters by 3 cows to find the milk production per cow: 5 liters / 3 cows = 1.67 liters per cow.

Now, we need to find out how many cows are required to produce 25 liters of milk per day. We divide 25 liters by 1.67 liters per cow: 25 liters / 1.67 liters per cow = 15 cows.

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we subtract 3 from 15 to find out how many more cows he needs: 15 - 3 = 12.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to first find the length of each glue stick that is not used.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply the original length by the fraction used: 5/6 * 12 mm = 10 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 mm - 10 mm = 2 mm.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply the original length by the fraction used: 1/3 * 12 mm = 4 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 mm - 4 mm = 8 mm.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply the original length by the fraction used: 1/2 * 12 mm = 6 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 mm - 6 mm = 6 mm.

Now, we add the lengths of the unused parts: 2 mm + 8 mm + 6 mm = 16 mm.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total amount he has and subtract it from the total cost of the items he wants to buy.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200, so the total amount he has is $5000 + $200 = $5200.

The total cost of the items he wants to buy is $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10800.

To find out how much money he still needs, we subtract the total amount he has from the total cost: $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

Gabriel still needs $5600.

5600"
"To find the change Thea received, we need to calculate the total amount she paid with the four $20 bills and subtract the cost of the hat.

Total amount paid = 4 * $20 = $80

Change received = Total amount paid - Cost of the hat

"To find out how much money Craig has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from the initial amount of money he had.

Craig initially had 2 twenty dollar bills, which is 2 * $20 = $40.

He spent $2 on each of the 6 squirt guns, so the total cost of the squirt guns is 6 * $2 = $12.

He also spent $3 on each of the 3 packs of water balloons, so the total cost of the water balloons is 3 * $3 = $9.

The total amount Craig spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

Craig has $19 left."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many socks and dishes Jack and Peter have.

Since Jack collected 60 dishes and he has half times as many dishes as socks, we can find the number of socks Jack has by multiplying the number of dishes by 2. 

60 * 2 = 120 socks

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can find the number of socks Peter has by multiplying the number of socks Jack has by 2.

120 * 2 = 240 socks

Now, we know that Jack has 60 dishes and Peter has half times as many dishes as Jack. We can find the number of dishes Peter has by multiplying the number of dishes Jack has by 0.5.

60 * 0.5 = 30 dishes

Now, we can find the total number of socks and dishes they have together by adding the number of socks and dishes.

Total = 240 socks + 60 dishes + 30 dishes
Total = 240 + 90
Total = 330

The final answer is: 330"
"To find the number of students good at both math and English, we need to subtract the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at English only from the total number of students.

Number of students good at math only = 5
Number of students good at English only = 8
Total number of students = 20

Number of students good at both math and English = Total number of students - (Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at English only)
= 20 - (5 + 8)
= 20 - 13
= 7

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at both math and English.

Number of students good at math = Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at both math and English
= 5 + 7
= 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many groups can perform, we need to calculate the total time available for performances. 

The total time for each group is 2 minutes (getting on stage) + 6 minutes (performing) + 2 minutes (exiting) = 10 minutes.

The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. 

Subtracting the time for the intermission (10 minutes) from the total time, we get 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Now, we divide the remaining time by the time per group (10 minutes) to find out how many groups can perform: 110 / 10 = 11.

So, Vicki can have 11 groups perform in the concert.

"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest earned each year and add it to the principal amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year.

Year 1: Interest = $225, Total Amount = $300 + $225 = $525
Year 2: Interest = $225, Total Amount = $525 + $225 = $750
Year 3: Interest = $225, Total Amount = $750 + $225 = $975

The total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $975."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of white shirts with no collars and the number of floral shirts with no buttons.

First, let's find the number of white shirts with no collars. Since half of the white shirts have collars, the other half do not. 

Number of white shirts with no collars = Total number of white shirts / 2
= 40 / 2
= 20

Next, we know that 20 floral shirts have buttons. To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we subtract the number of floral shirts with buttons from the total number of floral shirts.

Number of floral shirts with no buttons = Total number of floral shirts - Number of floral shirts with buttons
= 50 - 20
= 30

Now, we can find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars.

Difference = Number of floral shirts with no buttons - Number of white shirts with no collars
= 30 - 20
= 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many trays the farmer can fill with 900 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold.

Number of trays = Total eggs / Eggs per tray
= 900 / 30
= 30 trays

Since the farmer sells each tray for $2.5, we multiply the number of trays by the selling price per tray to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Number of trays * Selling price per tray
= 30 * $2.5
= $75

The farmer will earn $75."
"To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm after the sale.

Initially, Farm X had 55 goats and Farm Y had 45 goats.

Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is 55 - 10 = 45.

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25.

Now, we add the number of goats left in both farms: 45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70.

The total number of goats left in both farms is 70."
"To find the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount spent on shoes per year by the number of pairs purchased per year.

Total amount spent per year = $2640
Number of pairs purchased per year = 2

Average cost per pair = Total amount spent per year / Number of pairs purchased per year
= $2640 / 2
= $1320

The average cost per pair of shoes is $1320."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the green food and the red food separately.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $18 = $54.

Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, the actual cost of the red food will be $54 - $6 (2 * 3) = $48.

The total cost will be the sum of the cost of the green food and the cost of the red food: $75 + $48 = $123.

"To find the total time required to clean one-half of the rooms, we need to first calculate the total time required to clean all the rooms and then divide it by 2.

Total time to clean all rooms = Number of rooms * Time to clean each room
Total time to clean all rooms = 90 * 20 minutes
Total time to clean all rooms = 1800 minutes

Since we want to find the time to clean one-half of the rooms, we divide the total time by 2:
Time to clean one-half of the rooms = Total time to clean all rooms / 2
Time to clean one-half of the rooms = 1800 / 2
Time to clean one-half of the rooms = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
Time to clean one-half of the rooms = 900 / 60
Time to clean one-half of the rooms = 15 hours

"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year and then add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the number of homes built in the first two years, which is 2 * (12 + 36) = 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's add the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

The town will have built 144 homes over the next three years."
"Let's denote my age as A, my brother's age as B, and my sister's age as S.

From the given information, we have the following equations:

1. A = B - 3 (I am three years younger than my brother)
2. A = S + 2 (I am 2 years older than my sister)
3. 3B - 1 = A (My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age)
4. A + B + S = 87 (The sum of our ages is 87)

We can substitute equation 1 into equation 3 to get:
3B - 1 = B - 3
2B = 2
B = 1

Now that we know B, we can find A using equation 1:
A = B - 3
A = 1 - 3
A = -2

However, age cannot be negative, so this solution is not valid.

Let's try another approach. We can substitute equation 2 into equation 4:
A + B + (A - 2) = 87
Combine like terms:
2A + B - 2 = 87
2A + B = 89

Now, substitute equation 1 into this equation:
2(B - 3) + B = 89
2B - 6 + B = 89
3B - 6 = 89
3B = 95
B = 31.67

Since B must be an integer, this solution is not valid.

Let's try another approach. We can substitute equation 1 into equation 3:
3B - 1 = B - 3
2B = 2
B = 1

Now, substitute B into equation 1:
A = B - 3
A = 1 - 3
A = -2

However, age cannot be negative, so this solution is not valid.

Let's try another approach. We can substitute equation 2 into equation 4:
A + B + (A + 2) = 87
Combine like terms:
2A + B + 2 = 87
2A + B = 85

Now, substitute equation 1 into this equation:
2(B - 3) + B = 85
2B - 6 + B = 85
3B - 6 = 85
3B = 91
B = 30.33

Since B must be an integer, this solution is not valid.

Let's try another approach. We can substitute equation 1 into equation 3:
3B - 1 = B - 3
2B = 2
B = 1

Now, substitute B into equation 2:
A = S + 2
A = S + 2

Now, substitute A and B into equation 4:
(S + 2) + 1 + S = 87
Combine like terms:
2S + 3 = 87
2S = 84
S = 42

Now that we know S, we can find A:
A = S + 2
A = 42 + 2
A = 44

"To find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs, we first need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks required is 27 * 2 = 54.

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by 8 to find out how many packs are needed. 54 / 8 = 6.75. 

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he will need 7 packs of glue sticks."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water passing through the river on the third day. 

Initially, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons. After the first day, the amount doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons. 

On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles again, so it becomes 2 * 8000 = 16000 gallons. 

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 16000 + 6000 = 22000 gallons.

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 22000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. 

Initially, there are 10 infected people. 

Day 1: 10 infected people infect 6 others, so the total number of infected people becomes 10 + 6 = 16.

Day 2: The 16 infected people from Day 1 infect 6 others each, so the total number of infected people becomes 16 + (16 * 6) = 16 + 96 = 112.

Day 3: The 112 infected people from Day 2 infect 6 others each, so the total number of infected people becomes 112 + (112 * 6) = 112 + 672 = 784.

Therefore, after three days, there are 784 infected people.

"To find the total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela, we first need to calculate the amount of tips each of them received.

Rafaela received $20 from each of the 40 customers, so the total amount of tips she received is 20 * 40 = $800.

Since Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela, we need to calculate 10% of Rafaela's tips and subtract it from Rafaela's total. 10% of $800 is 0.1 * 800 = $80.

Now, subtracting this amount from Rafaela's total, we get 800 - 80 = $720.

So, Julieta received $720 in tips.

The total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela is 720 + 800 = $1520.

"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to subtract the total number of oranges she gave to her children from the total number of oranges she initially bought.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges.
She gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, so she gave 3 x 2 = 6 oranges to her daughters.
She also gave 3 oranges to her son.
In total, she gave away 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Now, we subtract the total number of oranges given away from the initial number of oranges: 12 - 9 = 3.

Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 12 badges.

Since it takes Amber twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, Amber earns 1/2 of Claire's badges per month. So, Amber earns 1/2 * 1 = 0.5 badges per month. In a year, Amber earns 0.5 * 12 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. So, Wendy earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

The final answer is 30."
"To find out how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices she baked and sold. 

She baked 2 loaves per hour, and she baked for 5 hours (from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM). So, she baked 2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she had 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 slices * $0.50/slice = $40.

"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to first determine the number of silver coins. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation:

Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Then, the number of gold coins is 'x + 30'. We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 70

Subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation gives us:

x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins:

Total coins = 70 (gold coins) + 40 (silver coins) = 110

"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to first calculate the total number of burritos given to the students. Since there were 50 students and each student was given 10 burritos, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

However, Mr. George ate 20 burritos, so we need to subtract those from the total number of burritos given to the students. 

The total number of leftover burritos is 500 - 20 = 480.

"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first determine the number of green and blue cars.

Since there are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, and there are 12 red cars, the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we know the total number of cars is 75. We have already accounted for 12 red cars, 10 green cars, and 30 blue cars. 

To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total: 75 - 12 - 10 - 30 = 23.

Therefore, the rink has 23 yellow cars.

"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the number of books each person has. Let's say Anne has x books. Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has x + 25 books. 

We are also told that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has x + 12 books.

We know that the total number of books is 85, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 25) + (x + 12) = 85

Combine like terms:

3x + 37 = 85

Subtract 37 from both sides:

3x = 48

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 16

Now that we know Anne has 16 books, we can find the number of books Fawn has by adding 12:

Fawn has 16 + 12 = 28 books.

"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to find out how much they spend per week in total. 

Since they spend $400 per month, we divide this by 4 to get the weekly cost: 
$400 / 4 = $100 per week.

Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, we need to find 40% of the total weekly cost to determine Keenan's share. 
40% of $100 is 0.4 * $100 = $40.

So, Keenan spends $40 per week.

"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day and add them together.

First, let's find out how many pieces he ate on the first day. Since he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces, we can calculate it as follows:

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, he ate 24 pieces on the first day.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's find out how many pieces are left after the first two days. We subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total:

60 - 24 - 10 = 26

Now, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces on the third day. We can calculate it as follows:

7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14

So, he ate 14 pieces on the third day.

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate each day:

24 + 10 + 14 = 48

Tobias has eaten 48 pieces so far.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the soda and the cost of the water separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 bottles of soda is 3 * $21.00 = $63.00.

The cost of 2 bottles of water is 2 * $8.00 = $16.00.

The total cost is $63.00 + $16.00 = $79.00.

"To find out how much money David has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the bolts and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

The cost of one bolt is $0.03. Since David wants to buy 16 bolts, the total cost will be:
16 * $0.03 = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount of money David has:
$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts."
"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours, we need to calculate her hourly rate of pay. 

We can do this by dividing her earnings by the number of hours she worked: 
$33 ÷ 3 hours = $11 per hour

Now, we can multiply her hourly rate by the number of hours she will work: 
$11 per hour × 12 hours = $132

The final answer is 132."
"To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow the order of operations.

First, we add the marbles Paul initially had to the marbles his friend gave him: 52 + 28 = 80.

Then, we calculate 1/4 of the total marbles Paul had after receiving the marbles from his friend: 1/4 * 80 = 20.

Now, we subtract the marbles Paul lost from the total: 80 - 20 = 60.

So, Paul has 60 marbles left.

"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points from each type of question and add them together.

For multiple-choice questions: 
There are 10 questions, and she answers 80% of them correctly. 
80% of 10 is 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions answered correctly. 
Since each question is worth 1 point, she scores 8 points from multiple-choice questions.

For true/false questions: 
There are 20 questions, and she answers 90% of them correctly. 
90% of 20 is 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions answered correctly. 
Since each question is worth 1 point, she scores 18 points from true/false questions.

For long-answer questions: 
There are 5 questions, and she answers 60% of them correctly. 
60% of 5 is 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions answered correctly. 
Since each question is worth 5 points, she scores 3 * 5 = 15 points from long-answer questions.

Now, we add the points from each type of question: 
8 (multiple-choice) + 18 (true/false) + 15 (long-answer) = 41 points.

The final answer is 41."
"To find out how much Isaias bought the chicken for, we first need to determine how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them, we can calculate the number of chickens he plans to sell as follows:

Number of chickens to sell = 3/5 * 300
= 3 * 60
= 180

Since Isaias plans to sell the chickens at $50 each, the total amount of money he will make from selling 180 chickens is:

Total money from selling chickens = 180 * $50
= $9000

However, Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. To find out how much he needs to sell the chickens for, we can subtract the desired profit from the total money he will make:

Desired profit = $2000
Total money from selling chickens = $9000
Total money needed to make a profit of $2000 = $9000 - $2000
= $7000

Since Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens, we can divide the total money needed by the number of chickens to find the selling price per chicken:

Selling price per chicken = $7000 / 180
= $38.89

Now that we know the selling price per chicken, we can find the cost price per chicken by subtracting the selling price from the selling price per chicken:

Cost price per chicken = Selling price per chicken - Selling price
= $38.89 - $50
= -$11.11

However, since the cost price cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate our previous steps. Let's re-examine the calculation:

Desired profit = $2000
Total money from selling chickens = $9000
Total money needed to make a profit of $2000 = $9000 - $2000
= $7000

Since Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens, we can divide the total money needed by the number of chickens to find the selling price per chicken:

Selling price per chicken = $7000 / 180
= $38.89

However, we know that Isaias plans to sell the chickens at $50 each. To make a profit of $2000, he needs to sell the chickens at a price higher than $50. Let's re-evaluate the calculation:

Desired profit = $2000
Number of chickens to sell = 3/5 * 300
= 180

Let's assume the cost price per chicken is x. Then, the selling price per chicken will be x + $50 (to make a profit). The total money from selling 180 chickens will be:

Total money from selling chickens = 180 * (x + $50)
= 180x + $9000

Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, we can set up the equation:

180x + $9000 = $9000
180x = $0

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Melanie's current age. 

Since Melanie will be 18 in 10 years, her current age is 18 - 10 = 8 years.

Now, we need to find the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age. 

Let's denote the number of years as 'x'. 

We can set up the equation: 8 + x = 3 * 8

Simplifying the equation: 8 + x = 24

Subtracting 8 from both sides: x = 16

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart.

First, we know that 5 packs of bacon cost $10. Since each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, the cost of each pack of chicken is $10 * 2 = $20. So, 6 packets of chicken cost 6 * $20 = $120.

Next, we know that 3 packs of strawberries cost $4 each, so the total cost of strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

Lastly, 7 packs of apples cost half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. So, the total cost of apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart: $10 (bacon) + $120 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $156.

Since Kelly's budget is $65, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget to find out how much money she has left: $65 - $156 = -$91.

However, since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this indicates that Kelly does not have enough money in her budget to buy all the items in her cart."

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we divide the number of successfully arranged microphones by 2 to find the number of pairs. 

40 / 2 = 20 

The singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage."
"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate the number of birds in each category and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of birds flying overhead. Since 2/3 of the birds are flying overhead, we multiply the total number of birds in the bushes by 2/3.

Number of birds flying overhead = 6 * (2/3) = 4

Next, we need to find the total number of birds in the groups. There are 3 groups of 8 birds each, so we multiply the number of groups by the number of birds in each group.

Number of birds in groups = 3 * 8 = 24

Now, we add the number of birds in the bushes, the number of birds flying overhead, and the number of birds in the groups to find the total number of birds.

Total number of birds = 6 + 4 + 24 = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to first determine the total number of cookies Lani placed into the jars. 

She started with 55 cookies and ate 5, so the number of cookies left is 55 - 5 = 50.

Since she placed the remaining cookies equally into 5 jars, we divide the remaining cookies by 5. 

50 / 5 = 10

So, there were 10 cookies in each jar.

10"
"To find the total number of petals on the orchids, we multiply the number of orchids by the number of petals per orchid: 5 orchids * 5 petals = 25 petals.

To find the total number of petals on the daisies, we multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 4 daisies * 10 petals = 40 petals.

Now, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies to find the difference: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

The daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids."
"To find the number of flowering plants, we first need to find the number of indoor and outdoor plants.

Number of indoor plants = 1/4 * 100 = 25
Number of remaining plants = 100 - 25 = 75

Number of outdoor plants = 2/3 * 75 = 50
Number of flowering plants = 75 - 50 = 25

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100.

Percentage of flowering plants = (25 / 100) * 100 = 25%

The final answer is 25."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the speeds of the whirligig, thingamabob, and whatchamacallit. 

Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as x meters per second. 

Since a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, its speed is 11x meters per second.

We are given that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. 

So, we can set up the equation: 11x = 121

To find the speed of the thingamabob, we divide both sides of the equation by 11: x = 121 / 11 = 11 meters per second.

Since a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob, its speed is 5x = 5 * 11 = 55 meters per second.

The final answer is 55."
"To find the cost of one carrot, we need to first determine the total cost of the salad and yogurt. 

The salad costs $6, and the yogurt costs half of that, which is $6 / 2 = $3. 

The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9. 

Since Ellen pays $11 in total, the cost of the carrots is $11 - $9 = $2. 

To find the cost of one carrot, we divide the total cost of carrots by the number of carrots Ellen eats, which is 2. 

$2 / 2 = $1.

The final answer is $1."
"To find Mark's new hourly wage, we need to add the $2 raise to his original hourly wage. 

New hourly wage = Original hourly wage + Raise
New hourly wage = $10 + $2
New hourly wage = $12

Since Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, we need to multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works per week and the number of days he works per week.

Weekly earnings = New hourly wage * Hours worked per day * Days worked per week
Weekly earnings = $12 * 8 * 5
Weekly earnings = $480

The final answer is 480."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much Tasha made from mowing lawns. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of times Tasha mowed lawns is 3x + 5x = 8x.

Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and we know that she mowed Joe's lawn x times, we can set up the equation 6x = 6. 

Solving for x, we get x = 1.

So, Tasha mowed Joe's lawn once, Kamala's lawn three times, and Alba's lawn five times. 

The total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns is 6x + 3(6) + 5(6) = 6 + 18 + 30 = 54.

Since Tasha made $80 in total, the amount she made from lemonade sales is 80 - 54 = 26.

The final answer is 26."
"To find Harry's weight, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Martin's weight is 55 kg.
2. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
3. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
4. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

The final answer is: 74"
"To find John's profit, we need to calculate his total monthly income and subtract his car payment.

First, let's calculate his total monthly income:
Number of rentals per month: 10
Hours per rental: 3
Total hours per month: 10 * 3 = 30 hours
Hourly wage: $25
Total monthly income: 30 hours * $25/hour = $750

Now, let's subtract his car payment:
Car payment: $500
Total monthly income: $750
Profit: $750 - $500 = $250

The final answer is: $250"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many notebooks Joseph had initially. Since Martha had 7 notebooks and she had 3 times as many as Joseph, we can set up an equation to find Joseph's initial number of notebooks.

Let's denote Joseph's initial number of notebooks as J. Since Martha had 3 times as many notebooks as Joseph, we can write the equation:

3J = 7

To find J, we divide both sides by 3:

J = 7 / 3
J = 2.33

So, Joseph initially had 2.33 notebooks.

Now, we know Martha bought 5 more notebooks, so she now has 7 + 5 = 12 notebooks.

To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract Joseph's initial number of notebooks from Martha's current number of notebooks:

12 - 2.33 = 9.67

So, Martha now has 9.67 more notebooks than Joseph.

9.67"
"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we need to first calculate the distance Anis rowed. 

Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis' distance as follows:

Anis' distance = Dijana's distance + (1/5 * Dijana's distance)
Anis' distance = 50 + (1/5 * 50)
Anis' distance = 50 + 10
Anis' distance = 60

Now, we can find the total distance rowed by both of them by adding their individual distances:

Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis' distance
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we first need to subtract the cookies that Susan's husband took from the total number of cookies. 

Total cookies = 100
Cookies taken by husband = 4

Remaining cookies = Total cookies - Cookies taken by husband
Remaining cookies = 100 - 4
Remaining cookies = 96

Now, we divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews to find out how many each will get.

Number of nephews = 6
Cookies per nephew = Remaining cookies / Number of nephews
Cookies per nephew = 96 / 6
Cookies per nephew = 16

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how many pages Denise read more than Daniel, we need to calculate the total pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday, which is 13 + 5 = 18 pages. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, his total is still 13 pages.

Now, let's calculate the difference in the total pages read by Denise and Daniel. Denise read 10 + 18 = 28 pages, and Daniel read 13 pages. 

The difference is 28 - 13 = 15 pages.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we first need to calculate the total number of bowls of soup Calvin has. Since the pot can fill four adult bowls or eight child's bowls, we can say that the pot can fill 4x2 = 8 bowls in total.

Calvin and his wife are adults, so they will eat 2 bowls. This leaves 8 - 2 = 6 bowls of soup.

There are two children, so we divide the remaining 6 bowls by 2 to find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch. 6 / 2 = 3.

Each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch 3 times."
"To find the total amount William spent, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately and then add them together.

The cost of 5 notebooks is 5 x $1.50 = $7.50
The cost of 1 ballpen is $0.50

Total cost = cost of notebooks + cost of ballpen
Total cost = $7.50 + $0.50
Total cost = $8

The final answer is: $8"
"To find the total material needed, we need to calculate the material required for each type of mask and then add them together.

For small masks: 
20 small masks / 4 small masks per 2 yards = 5 sets of 2 yards
So, 5 sets of 2 yards = 10 yards

For large masks:
8 large masks / 3 large masks per 2.25 yards = 3.78 sets of 2.25 yards
Since we can't have a fraction of a set, we'll round down to 3 sets of 2.25 yards
3 sets of 2.25 yards = 6.75 yards

Now, add the material needed for both types of masks:
10 yards (small) + 6.75 yards (large) = 16.75 yards

The total material needed is 16.75 yards."
"To find the average price per ticket, we need to divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets. 

First, we need to find the total number of tickets. Since Deepa has seen each movie three times, and there are 9 movies, the total number of tickets is 9 * 3 = 27.

Now, we can divide the total amount spent ($216) by the total number of tickets (27) to find the average price per ticket.

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
= $216 / 27
= $8

The average price per ticket is $8."
"To find Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total hours in a day and subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

There are 24 hours in a day. 

Harold sleeps for 10 hours, so he has 24 - 10 = 14 hours left.

He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

He walks his dog for 1 hour.

Now, let's subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog from the total hours in a day: 
24 - 10 - 8 - 1 = 5

So, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day.

5"
"To find the number of red and blue shoe boxes left, we need to calculate the number of red and blue shoe boxes used and subtract that from the total number of each type of shoe box.

Number of blue shoe boxes used: 3
Number of red shoe boxes used: 1/3 * 9 = 3

Number of blue shoe boxes left: 7 - 3 = 4
Number of red shoe boxes left: 9 - 3 = 6

So, there are 4 blue shoe boxes and 6 red shoe boxes left in Tim's box.

4"
"To find the number of books Joseph currently has, we need to first determine how many books he had initially. Since Joseph had twice the number of Sarah's books, and Sarah has 9 books, Joseph initially had 2 * 9 = 18 books.

However, Joseph lost 2 books, so we need to subtract 2 from the initial number of books he had. 

18 - 2 = 16

Joseph currently has 16 books."
"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to first calculate how many marbles he gave away. 

He gave 1/5 of 30 marbles to Jamie, which is (1/5) * 30 = 6 marbles. 

Then, he gave 10 marbles to Donald. 

So, the total marbles Dean gave away is 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

Now, we subtract the marbles given away from the initial amount: 30 - 16 = 14.

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We are given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be expressed as:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

We are also given that Duncan's current age is 60. So, D = 60.

Substituting D = 60 into the equation, we get:

60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)
52 = 2A - 8

Now, let's solve for A:

52 + 8 = 2A
60 = 2A
A = 30

Now that we know Adam's current age, we can find his age in 8 years:

A + 8 = 30 + 8
A + 8 = 38

So, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total number of acres, we need to first calculate the size of Farmer Smith's farm. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's farm. Since Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, twice that would be 2 * 200 = 400 acres. Adding 100 acres to that makes 400 + 100 = 500 acres for Farmer Smith's farm.

Now, we add the acres of both farms together: 200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The total number of acres the two farms have together is 700."
"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to first determine how many packages he completes in that time. 

Since he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, we can calculate the number of packages he completes in an 8-hour workday as follows:

50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour
40 packages/hour * 8 hours = 320 packages

Now, we can calculate his earnings for the day:

320 packages * $0.20/package = $64

The final answer is $64."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time John spends on both the normal and extreme sudoku puzzles. 

First, we calculate the time for the normal sudoku: 45 minutes. 

Since the extreme sudoku takes 4 times as long, we multiply 45 minutes by 4 to get the time for the extreme sudoku: 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Now, we add the time for both puzzles: 45 + 180 = 225 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we divide the total time by 30 minutes to find out how many bottles he drinks: 225 / 30 = 7.5.

So, John drinks 7.5 bottles of water in that time.

7.5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons. We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We also know that there are 20 red balloons.

Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as 'y'. Since Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna in total, we can set up the equation:

2 * 20 + 3 * y = 58

Simplifying the equation:

40 + 3y = 58

Subtract 40 from both sides:

3y = 18

Divide both sides by 3:

y = 6

So, there are 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

"To determine the number of tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total distance he drives in 30 days. 

Since Jon drives 100 miles a day, the total distance driven in 30 days is 100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles.

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can divide the total distance driven by 1000 to find the number of tune-ups needed: 3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total hours Bruce works in the three days, we need to calculate the hours he works each day.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.
On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, we add the hours he works each day to find the total hours: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

23"
"To find out how much money Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2.

First, let's calculate the cost of the balloons. Since 1 dozen balloons cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, 1 balloon costs $0.5 / 2 = $0.25. So, 12 balloons cost 12 * $0.25 = $3.

The total cost of the items purchased is the cost of the cake ($11) + the cost of the balloons ($3) + the cost of the ice cream (2 * $7 = $14). So, the total cost is $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since they combined their allowance, the total amount of money they had is the total cost of the items purchased ($28) plus the amount they spent on the ice cream (2 * $7 = $14). However, this is not necessary as we can simply use the total cost of the items purchased ($28) to find the total allowance.

Now, we divide the total cost of the items purchased ($28) by 2 to find the amount of money each girl received. $28 / 2 = $14.

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14.

14"
"To find the total number of fruits Kira bought, we need to add the number of apples, bananas, and oranges. 

3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14

6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 16 (soccer) + 22 (soccer) = 56

There are 56 students in total."
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total revenue. Each student sold 10 lollipops at $0.8 per lollipop, so the revenue per student is 10 * $0.8 = $8. Since there are 30 students, the total revenue is 30 * $8 = $240.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. Each student bought 10 lollipops at $0.5 per lollipop, so the cost per student is 10 * $0.5 = $5. Since there are 30 students, the total cost is 30 * $5 = $150.

Now, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit: $240 - $150 = $90.

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

90"
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and then add them together.

Larry has 3 cats.
He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 x 3 = 9 dogs.
He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 x 7 = 21 fish.
He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 1/3 x 21 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets.

The total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"To determine how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices each person can eat per day and then divide the total number of slices in the loaf by the combined daily consumption.

Abby eats 2 slices per day, and Josh eats twice as much, so Josh eats 2 * 2 = 4 slices per day.

Combined daily consumption: 2 (Abby) + 4 (Josh) = 6 slices per day.

Now, divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the combined daily consumption (6):

24 / 6 = 4

The loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"To find the total number of shells Martha has collected, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and now she is 10 years old, the number of months she has been collecting shells is 10 - 5 = 5 years.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the number of years by 12 to get the total number of months: 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

Since Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she has collected is equal to the number of months she has been collecting shells: 60 months.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we first need to determine the total number of cups of mint tea. Since Lana brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea, and she has 27 cups in total, the number of cups of mint tea is 27 - 15 = 12.

Since she divides the cups into 3 rows, and each row has an equal number of cups of mint tea, we can divide the total number of cups of mint tea by 3 to find the number of cups in each row. 

12 / 3 = 4

So, there are 4 cups of mint tea in each row."
"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick per trip, we need to first determine the total number of trips he can make in 8 hours. 

Since it takes the sloth 4 hours to make a round trip, we divide the total time available (8 hours) by the time per trip (4 hours). 

8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips

Since the sloth can make 2 trips in 8 hours, and he wants to collect 24 berries, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips.

24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip

Therefore, the sloth needs to pick 12 berries per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in the tank after 6 days.

Initially, the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, which is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Since the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, we can calculate the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days by subtracting the total amount emptied from the initial amount.

Total amount emptied in 6 days = 500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons

Amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days = Initial amount - Total amount emptied
= 5000 gallons - 3000 gallons
= 2000 gallons

The final answer is: 2000"
"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying popcorn and candy.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He has already spent $8 on popcorn (2 tubs) and $8 on candy (4 boxes), so he has $150 - $8 - $8 = $134 left.

Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10. We need to find out how many $10 tickets Colby can buy with $134. 

$134 / $10 = 13.4

Since Colby can't buy a fraction of a ticket, he can buy 13 tickets. 

Now, we need to subtract the cost of the tickets from the remaining money. 

13 * $10 = $130

$134 - $130 = $4

Colby has $4 left. Since tickets for other days cost $7, he can buy 4 / $7 = 0.57 (round down to 0 since he can't buy a fraction of a ticket) or 0 tickets on other days.

In total, Colby can see 13 movies.

The final answer is 13."
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, we can calculate the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked:

200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked is 85,000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to first calculate the total number of Junebugs removed.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, which is 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 222

There are 5 days in total. To find the average, we divide the total by 5.

Average = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days
Average = 222 / 5
Average = 44.4

The average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 44.4."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus traveled at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 300 miles

The car traveled at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 8 hours
Distance = 240 miles

To find the difference in distance, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car
Difference = 300 miles - 240 miles
Difference = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."

"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as A, and Jean's age as J.

We are given the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: P + A + J = 100
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: A = J + 10
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: P = A + J

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to get: P = (J + 10) + J
Simplifying this, we get: P = 2J + 10

Now, we can substitute the expression for P into the first equation: (2J + 10) + A + J = 100
Substituting A = J + 10 into this equation, we get: (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms: 4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides: 4J = 80
Divide by 4: J = 20

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age: A = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
And finally, we can find Peter's age: P = A + J = 30 + 20 = 50

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons each person had and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, each of Maria's 4 friends had 2 balloons, so the total number of balloons they had is 4 * 2 = 8.

Maria had 2 balloons for herself.

Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (4 friends + Maria), the total number of balloons given by Maria's mom is 5 * 3 = 15.

Now, we add the initial balloons (8) to the additional balloons (15) to find the total number of balloons: 8 + 15 = 23.

Therefore, the total number of balloons the girls had is 23.

23"
"To find the total number of boxes of stuff, we need to add the boxes donated by the 10 people and the boxes they already own. 

10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes
50 boxes + 10 boxes = 60 boxes

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find the number of tables needed.

60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

They already have 15 tables, so we subtract this from the total number of tables needed.

30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables

The charity group needs 15 new tables."
"To find the total distance each person spat, we need to multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed was spat.

Zoey's total distance = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet
Sydney's total distance = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet

To find the average total distance, we need to add the total distances and divide by 2.

Average total distance = (Zoey's total distance + Sydney's total distance) / 2
= (400 + 420) / 2
= 820 / 2
= 410 feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine the difference in earnings between the two machines, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month and then multiply that by the selling price of each widget.

The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour and runs for 24 hours a day. In a month with 30 days, it will produce:
60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets

The WidgetMaster 9000 produces 45 widgets per hour and runs for 24 hours a day. In a month with 30 days, it will produce:
45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Since each widget sells for $6, the total earnings from the Widgeteer 3000 will be:
43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

The total earnings from the WidgetMaster 9000 will be:
32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $192,000

The difference in earnings between the two machines is:
$259,200 - $192,000 = $67,200

The final answer is: $67,200"
"To determine the amount of money Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of the 12-hour stay and the additional hours.

The 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos. 

Cameron stays for 5 hours after the 12-hour mark, which is from 12 am to 5 am. The additional hours are 5 hours. 

The cost of the additional hours is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.

The total cost for Cameron is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

The cost of the 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

Cameron would save 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final answer is 250."
"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs as follows:

Sheep's hay = 2 * Goat's hay - 3
Sheep's hay = 2 * 5 - 3
Sheep's hay = 10 - 3
Sheep's hay = 7 pounds

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

Total hay for goats = Number of goats * Goat's hay
Total hay for goats = 15 * 5
Total hay for goats = 75 pounds

Total hay for sheep = Number of sheep * Sheep's hay
Total hay for sheep = 12 * 7
Total hay for sheep = 84 pounds

Now, we can find the total amount of hay needed by adding the hay for goats and sheep:

Total hay needed = Total hay for goats + Total hay for sheep
Total hay needed = 75 + 84
Total hay needed = 159 pounds

The final answer is: 159"
"To find out how much money John has left after buying the pencils, we need to subtract the cost of the pencils from his earnings.

John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left.

He also buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so the total cost of the pencils is 5 * 10 = 50 dollars.

Now, subtracting the cost of the pencils from his remaining earnings, John has 250 - 50 = 200 dollars left.

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has 200 - 100 = 100 dollars left.

To find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy, we divide the remaining amount by 25: 100 / 25 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total number of letters in the words spelled by Craig, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word: 20 words * 15 letters = 300 letters.

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. So, we add 50 to Craig's total: 300 + 50 = 350 letters.

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is 300 (Craig) + 350 (Craig's brother) = 650 letters.

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to first determine how many bottles she gave out. Since there are 29 pupils and each pupil received 2 bottles of apple juice, the total number of bottles given out is 29 * 2 = 58.

Since the teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice, the total number of bottles she has is 9 * 100 = 900.

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given out from the total number of bottles she had: 900 - 58 = 842.

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the costs into the fixed charge, labor, and parts.

The fixed charge is $40. 

The labor cost is calculated by multiplying the number of hours worked (2.25) by the hourly rate ($35). Since the rate is per hour, we can round down to 2 hours for simplicity, as the rate is charged per hour or part thereof. 

Labor cost = 2 hours * $35/hour = $70

The total cost of parts is $60.

Now, we add the fixed charge, labor cost, and parts cost to get the total cost.

Total cost = $40 (fixed charge) + $70 (labor) + $60 (parts) = $170

The final answer is: $170"
"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. 

The total cost of the CDs is 10 * $15 = $150.

Since James got them for 40% off, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
Discount = 40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60.

So, the total cost after the discount is $150 - $60 = $90.

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each. The total amount he got from selling them is 5 * $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he got from selling the CDs from the total cost after the discount. 
$90 - $200 = -$110.

James was out $110.

"To find the total amount Jen will earn, we need to calculate the total revenue from each type of root crop and then add them together.

For yams: 6 yams * $1.5 per yam = $9
For sweet potatoes: 10 sweet potatoes * $2 per sweet potato = $20
For carrots: 4 carrots * $1.25 per carrot = $5

Total revenue = $9 + $20 + $5 = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's calculate the distance James swims at 2 miles per hour. Since he swims 60% of the total distance, we can calculate the distance he swims as follows:

Distance = 20 miles * 0.6 = 12 miles

Now, let's calculate the time it takes James to swim 12 miles at 2 miles per hour:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

After swimming 12 miles, James rests for half as long as the swimming time. So, he rests for:

Rest time = 6 hours / 2
Rest time = 3 hours

Now, let's calculate the remaining distance James needs to swim:

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance swum
Remaining distance = 20 miles - 12 miles
Remaining distance = 8 miles

Since James swims at half the speed, his new speed is:

New speed = 2 miles per hour / 2
New speed = 1 mile per hour

Now, let's calculate the time it takes James to swim the remaining 8 miles at 1 mile per hour:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

Now, let's add up the time James spent swimming, resting, and swimming again:

Total time = Swimming time + Rest time + Swimming time
Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 17 hours

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to first calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

Since the bakery has 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had, we subtract 40 from 490. 

490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"To find out how many stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to follow the order of events.

Initially, Jasmine had 15 stickers. She lost 7 stickers during playtime, so we subtract 7 from 15: 15 - 7 = 8.

"To find the total commission, we need to calculate the commission from each newspaper separately and then add them together.

Commission from the New York Times: 
6 copies * $5 * 10% = 6 * 0.1 * 5 = $3

Commission from the Wall Street Journal: 
10 copies * $15 * 8% = 10 * 0.08 * 15 = $12

Total commission = Commission from the New York Times + Commission from the Wall Street Journal
Total commission = $3 + $12
Total commission = $15

"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given about the relationships between the ages of Marcus, Leo, and Deanna.

Let's denote Marcus's age as M, Leo's age as L, and Deanna's age as D.

We know that:
1. Marcus is half of Leo's age: M = 0.5L
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna: M = D - 5
3. Deanna is 26 years old: D = 26

We can substitute the value of D into the second equation: M = 26 - 5
M = 21

Now, we can substitute the value of M into the first equation: 21 = 0.5L
To find L, we multiply both sides by 2: L = 21 * 2
L = 42

So, Leo is 42 years old.

42"
"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Dinar. 

Let's denote the points scored by Dinar as 'x'. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati scored x + 10 points. 

We know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Azibo scored (x + 10) - 20 points. 

We also know that the total points scored by all three is 45. So, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 10) + (x + 10 - 20) = 45.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 3x = 45.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: x = 15.

Now that we know Dinar scored 15 points, we can find out how many points Azibo scored: Azibo scored (15 + 10) - 20 = 5 points.

2 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 3 pages

The book contains 3 pages."
"To find the total number of reports stapled, we need to calculate the total minutes Vince worked and then divide it by the time it takes him to staple 30 reports.

Vince worked from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. 

15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we can divide the total minutes by 15 to find the total number of sets of 30 reports.

900 minutes / 15 minutes/set = 60 sets

Since each set contains 30 reports, we multiply the number of sets by 30.

60 sets * 30 reports/set = 1800 reports

Therefore, Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether.

1800"
"To find the total minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she woke up early to go to the bathroom.

First, let's calculate the time she was asleep. She usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. However, she woke up 5 minutes early to go to the bathroom, so we need to subtract those 5 minutes from her usual wake-up time.

Her usual wake-up time is 6 a.m., and she woke up 5 minutes early, so her wake-up time that day was 5:55 a.m.

Now, let's calculate the time she was asleep. She went to sleep at 10 p.m. and woke up at 5:55 a.m. We need to convert both times to minutes.

10 p.m. is 10 * 60 = 600 minutes before 12 a.m.
5:55 a.m. is 5 * 60 + 55 = 355 minutes after 12 a.m.

Now, we can calculate the time she was asleep by subtracting the time she went to sleep from the time she woke up.

Time asleep = 355 - 600 = -245 minutes

However, since we can't have negative time, we need to add 24 hours to the time she went to sleep to get the correct time.

Time asleep = 600 + 24 * 60 = 1800 minutes

Now, we can calculate the time she was asleep.

Time asleep = 1800 - 355 = 1445 minutes

However, we also need to account for the time she was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m. We need to add this time to the total time she was asleep.

Time asleep = 1445 + 23 = 1468 minutes

The final answer is: 1468"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan initially has. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has 2 dozen cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

2 dozen cups = 2 * 12 = 24 cups
Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, the number of measuring spoons = 2/3 * 24 = 16

Now, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. To find the total number of utensils remaining, we subtract the number of measuring spoons gifted from the initial number of measuring spoons:

Initial measuring spoons = 16
Measuring spoons gifted = 6
Remaining measuring spoons = 16 - 6 = 10

Jonathan also has 2 dozen cups, which is 24 cups. So, the total number of utensils remaining is the sum of the remaining measuring spoons and cups:

Total utensils remaining = 10 (measuring spoons) + 24 (cups) = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the total number of occupied beds, we first need to calculate the number of occupied beds initially. 

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 are occupied. 

1/5 of 1000 is 200 beds. 

Now, 50 patients are admitted each day. 

In 2 weeks (14 days), 50 * 14 = 700 patients will be admitted. 

The total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks will be 200 + 700 = 900 beds.

The total number of unoccupied beds will be 1000 - 900 = 100 beds.

"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we first need to determine the total number of non-work emails she sends. 

She sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the non-work emails are to her family, which means she sends 2/3 * 9 = 6 emails to her family.

The remaining non-work emails are to her boyfriend. Since 6 emails are to her family, the number of emails to her boyfriend is 9 - 6 = 3.

Therefore, Robyn sends 3 emails a day to her boyfriend.

Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9

Now, we know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. To find Shawna's father's age, we multiply Shawna's age by 5.

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45

The final answer is 45."
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from Courtney's number.

First, let's find 20% of 48: 
20% of 48 = 0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from Courtney's number:
48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.4."
"To solve this problem, we can start by identifying the relationships between the number of balls each boy picked up. 

Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, and Jason carried 2 balls, we can determine that Jeffrey carried half the number of balls that Jason did. 

So, Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, we can determine that Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is 2 (Jeffrey) + 4 (Jason) + 2 (Jordan) = 8 balls.

Therefore, the coach brought 8 balls to practice.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day. 

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 31 holes.

Since the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship: 

Let x be the number of holes dug on the fourth day. 

The total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 31 (from the first three days) + x (from the fourth day). This total is also equal to four times the number of holes at the end of the third day. 

So, we can write the equation: 31 + x = 4 * 31

Simplifying the equation, we get: 31 + x = 124

Subtracting 31 from both sides, we get: x = 93

Therefore, the pirates dug 93 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many corn chips Collins received. Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 15 more than the number the others got, Collins must have received 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, we know that the total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins. So, the total number of corn chips is 70 + 70 + 85 = 225.

The final answer is: 225"

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.

We know that together they have caught 339 Pokémon, so we can write the equation: A + S + X = 339.

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so we can write another equation: X = S + 5.

Lastly, we know that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so we can write: S = 4A - 13.

Now we can substitute the expression for S from the third equation into the first equation: A + (4A - 13) + X = 339.

Substituting X from the second equation into the previous equation, we get: A + (4A - 13) + (A + 5) = 339.

Combine like terms: 6A - 8 = 339.

Add 8 to both sides: 6A = 347.

Divide by 6: A = 57.83 (round down to 57 since we can't catch a fraction of a Pokémon).

Now that we know A, we can find S: S = 4A - 13 = 4(57) - 13 = 225.

So, Stan has caught 225 Pokémon.

"To find the total number of episodes, we need to divide the total minutes per episode by 2, since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. 

Total minutes per episode = 20 minutes
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the total number of episodes by the length of each episode.

"To find the total distance traveled by the bird, we need to calculate the distance covered in each leg of the journey and then sum them up.

The bird travels 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the first leg is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 10 = 300 miles

The bird then travels 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the second leg is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 18 * 2 = 36 miles

The bird then travels 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the third leg is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 22 * 5 = 110 miles

To find the total distance traveled, we add the distances covered in each leg:
Total Distance = 300 + 36 + 110 = 446 miles

However, since the bird ends up at her southern home, we need to consider the net displacement. The bird traveled 300 miles south and then 36 miles north, and finally 110 miles south. The net displacement is the sum of the distances traveled south:
Net Displacement = 300 + 110 = 410 miles

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 410 miles.

Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting, which is 48 brownies.

During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

Now, let's add up the total number of brownies she received: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

Then, subtract the number eaten: 66 - 18 = 48 brownies.

So, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day.

"To find the total age of the family members, we need to calculate the age of each member and then add them together.

Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 8 * 2 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. To find her age, we multiply Nani's age by 0.75 (which is 75% in decimal form). So, her age is 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we add the ages of all three family members: 8 (Nani) + 16 (brother) + 6 (sister) = 30 years.

The total age of the family members is 30 years."

"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2l + 2w, where l is the length and w is the width.

Given that the length (l) is 15 feet and the width (w) is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(15) + 2(10)
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

50 * 2 = 100

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats for his fence.

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the total number of oranges Mrs. Harrington initially had: 12 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 240 oranges.
2. Calculate the number of oranges she gave to her mom and sister: 2 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 40 oranges.
3. Calculate the number of oranges left after giving some to her mom and sister: 240 - 40 = 200 oranges.
4. Calculate the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington kept: 1/4 of 200 oranges = 200 / 4 = 50 oranges.
5. Calculate the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold: 200 - 50 = 150 oranges.

The final answer is: 150"
"To find the total number of states in both countries, we need to first determine the number of states in the USA and India.

The USA has 50 states.

India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Half of 50 is 25. Adding 4 to that gives us 29 states in India.

Now, we can find the total number of states in both countries by adding the number of states in the USA and India: 50 + 29 = 79.

"To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy. 

The total cost of the items is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has saved $14, we need to subtract this from the total cost to find out how much more he needs to earn. 

$39 (total cost) - $14 (saved) = $25 (amount still needed)

Now, we can divide the amount still needed by Tyler's hourly wage to find out how many hours he needs to work. 

$25 (amount still needed) / $5 (hourly wage) = 5 hours

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books.

"To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we need to first determine how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries, we can calculate Richard's share as follows:

Richard's cherries = Robert's cherries - 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting Richard's share from the total number of cherries:

Jerry's cherries = Total cherries - Richard's cherries - Robert's cherries
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 20 - 30
Jerry's cherries = 10

Now that we know Jerry has 10 cherries, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:

Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 10
Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of boxes sold for each day and then multiply it by the respective cost.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. Since he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread on Sunday, he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday. 

So, on Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie.

On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of gingerbread and 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each day:

Gingerbread earnings on Saturday: 10 boxes * $6 = $60
Gingerbread earnings on Sunday: 15 boxes * $6 = $90
Total gingerbread earnings: $60 + $90 = $150

Apple pie earnings on Saturday: 11 boxes * $15 = $165
Apple pie earnings on Sunday: 15 boxes * $15 = $225
Total apple pie earnings: $165 + $225 = $390

Total earnings for two days: $150 + $390 = $540

The final answer is: $540"
"To determine the number of bottles of sunscreen Pamela needs to pack, we need to calculate the total number of hours she will be outside.

She will be outside 4 hours a day for 8 days, so the total number of hours is:
4 hours/day * 8 days = 32 hours

Since she reappplies sunscreen every hour, she will need 32 bottles of sunscreen.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

40% of $100 = 0.4 * $100 = $40

Now, subtract $40 from the price of the blue car:
$100 - $40 = $60

So, the red car costs $60.

The blue car costs $100.

The final answer is: $60"
"To solve this problem, let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

We are given the following information:

1. Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = D/2.
3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B.

From the first equation, we can find D: D = 24 * 2 = 48.

From the second equation, we can find B: B = 24 / 2 = 12.

Now, we have the current ages of Emil, his dad, and his brother: E = 19, D = 48, and B = 12.

The sum of their ages is E + D + B = 19 + 48 + 12 = 79.

"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads each person gave her and then add them together.

Her mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day and add them together.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the amounts together: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings: 21 / 3 = 7.

The final answer is 7."
"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of students in each group and then add them together.

First, we find the number of football players: 20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after removing the football players: 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, we find the number of cheerleaders or band members: 25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Finally, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders/band members together: 6 + 6 = 12 students.

Therefore, 12 students are leaving early.

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. 

Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

The average size of the two shoes is the sum of their sizes divided by 2. 

Average size = (5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15.

The average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15."
"To determine the total cost, we first need to calculate the total space required for the flowers and the spaces between them. 

Since Pat's flowers grow 12 inches wide, we need to convert this to feet: 12 inches = 1 foot. 

The total space required for the flowers is 111 feet (bed length) - 1.5 feet (space between each flower) * (number of flowers - 1). 

First, we need to find the number of flowers that can fit in the bed. Since Pat already owns 17 flowers, we can fit 17 flowers in the bed. 

Now, we can calculate the total space required: 
Total space = 111 feet - 1.5 feet * (17 - 1) 
Total space = 111 feet - 1.5 feet * 16 
Total space = 111 feet - 24 feet 
Total space = 87 feet 

Since each flower is 1 foot wide, the total space required for the flowers is 87 feet. 

Now, we can calculate the total cost: 
Total cost = number of flowers * cost per flower 
Total cost = 17 flowers * $6 per flower 
Total cost = $102 

The final answer is: $102"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to first determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. 

Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, and Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, we can calculate his brother's daily pretzel consumption as follows:

18 pretzels * 1/2 = 9 pretzels per day

To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply his daily consumption by 7:

9 pretzels per day * 7 days = 63 pretzels per week

The final answer is: 63"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

The cost of petunias: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00

The cost of sweet potato vines: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00

Total cost = cost of petunias + cost of sweet potato vines = $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

The total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is $70.00."
"To find out how many roses they can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds each = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds each = 15 pounds

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds

Since they have 30 pounds of soil, we subtract the amount used for sunflowers and carnations from the total amount of soil.

30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses."
"To find out how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income. 

25% of $2,000.00 is 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00.

Since she sets aside $500.00 each month, we can calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year by dividing her monthly savings by the cost of a pair of shoes.

$500.00 / $1,000.00 = 0.5

Since you can't buy half a pair of shoes, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. 

0.5 -> 0

So, Jessica can buy 0 pairs of shoes in a year."
"To find the time it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to first determine the time it takes her to peel and cook 30 shrimp, and then multiply that time by 3.

Since Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can assume that the time it takes her to peel and cook 30 shrimp is also 10 minutes. 

Now, to find the time it takes to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we multiply the time it takes to peel and cook 30 shrimp by 3. 

Time = 10 minutes * 3 = 30 minutes.

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net cooling effect of the air conditioner.

The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. 

First, let's calculate the total cooling effect when the air conditioner is on low for 3 hours:
3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees

Then, let's calculate the total cooling effect when the air conditioner is on high for 4 hours:
4 hours * 3 degrees/hour = 12 degrees

The total cooling effect is the sum of these two:
6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees

However, the room will warm up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running. So, in the 2 hours after the air conditioner was turned off, the room will warm up by 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees.

To find the net cooling effect, we subtract the warming effect from the total cooling effect:
18 degrees - 4 degrees = 14 degrees

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

Final answer: 14"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as 'x'. 

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old, and the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can set up the following equation:

x + 75 = 3(30)

This equation represents the fact that Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time.

Simplifying the equation:

x + 75 = 90

Subtracting 75 from both sides:

x = 15

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks he writes per month and then multiply it by 12.

1. Checks for electric bill: 1 check per month
2. Checks for gas bill: 1 check per month
3. Checks to the church: 2 checks per month
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 4 checks per year (since there are 4 quarters in a year)

Total checks per month: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 checks
Total checks per year: 4 checks/month * 12 months/year = 48 checks/year

Buford writes 48 checks per year."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of flights made by the first plane in a day. 

Since the second plane makes 44 trips and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips in a day.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so it goes to Greece for 88 * (3/4) = 66 flights.

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. This means the first plane makes 88 - 66 = 22 flights to either France or Germany.

Since the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the first plane makes 22 / 2 = 11 flights to France in a day.

The final answer is 11."
"To find the combined length of time, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we need to convert the total duration from seconds to minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we divide the total duration by 60.

Total duration in minutes = (20 + 40 + 60) / 60 = 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents.

Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is 2 * $6 = $12. 

So, the total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since Adam bought the trousers for $30, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the total cost to find out how much he had to contribute from his savings.

$30 (total cost) - $18 (amount received from parents) = $12

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to find the average age of the group. We know the total age of the children is 20 and Akbar and Alessandro's ages are 3 and 4, respectively. 

Let's denote Helene's age as H and Wilfred's age as W. We are given that Helene is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. 

So, the average age of the group is 20 / 4 = 5. 

Since Helene is twice the average age, we can write the equation: H = 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we know the total age of the group is 20, and we have the ages of Akbar (3) and Alessandro (4). We can write the equation: 3 + 4 + H + W = 20.

Substituting H = 10 into the equation, we get: 3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 17 + W = 20.

Subtracting 17 from both sides, we get: W = 3.

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is 3."
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Walter has collected so far.

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, we need to find out how much his lawyer will contribute after Walter's friend gives him $200.

Walter's friend's contribution is $200, so the total amount Walter has now is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Since Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else, we multiply the total amount Walter has now ($2200) by 3. 

$2200 * 3 = $6600.

So, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600.

"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to calculate half of the total number of cookies brought by the guests. 

Total number of cookies = 100 guests * 15 cookies per guest = 1500 cookies

Half of the cookies = 1500 cookies / 2 = 750 cookies

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies given to the church by 15 to find the number of people in the church.

Number of people in the church = 750 cookies / 15 cookies per person = 50 people

The final answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of slices. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is 2 + 4 = 6.

Let's assume the total number of slices is x. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, we can set up the following equation:

2x = 2 * 4
2x = 8
x = 4

So, there are 4 slices in total. Since each adult gets 2 slices, each adult gets 2/4 = 1/2 of the total slices.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we can divide the number of slices each adult gets by the total number of slices and multiply by 100:

(1/2) / 4 = 1/8
1/8 * 100 = 12.5%

Therefore, each adult gets 12.5% of the watermelon.

"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest start time, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake. 

The total time required is the sum of the time to make the batter, bake the cake, cool the cake, and frost the cake. 

Time to make the batter = 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake = 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake = 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake = 10 minutes

Total time = 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes: 
180 minutes = 3 hours

Now, we need to subtract the total time from the desired serving time to find the latest start time. 
Desired serving time = 5:00 pm
Total time = 3 hours

Latest start time = 5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, Jordan should start making the cake by 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

"To find the total number of chocolate bars sold by Lisa and Peter, we need to add the number of boxes they sold. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. 
Total boxes sold = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

Since they sold 64 chocolate bars together, we can divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes to find the number of chocolate bars in a box.

Number of chocolate bars in a box = Total chocolate bars / Total boxes
= 64 / 8
= 8

The final answer is 8."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total revenue from the students.

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25, and it is rented 3 days a week. Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the total number of sessions in a month is 3 * 4 = 12 sessions.

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25, so the total cost of renting the studio in a month is 12 * $25 = $300.

The dance studio has 10 students, and each student pays $1.50 per session. The total revenue from the students per session is 10 * $1.50 = $15. The total revenue from the students in a month is 12 * $15 = $180.

The total expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is the total revenue from the students minus the total cost of renting the studio, which is $180 - $300 = -$120. However, since the cost of renting the studio exceeds the revenue from the students, the dance studio would incur a loss of $120 per month.

The final answer is -120."
"To find the number of chocolate bars in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars each person has by the number of boxes they have.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 64 / 4 = 16.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 56 / 7 = 8.

To find the difference, subtract the number of chocolate bars in each box of Martha from the number of chocolate bars in each box of Peter: 16 - 8 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population. 

Number of female porcupines = 3/5 * 50 = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of new porcupines added each month is 30 * 4 = 120.

In a year, there are 12 months, so the total number of new porcupines added in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the initial population plus the new porcupines added. 

Total porcupines after a year = 50 (initial population) + 1440 (new porcupines) = 1490.

The final answer is: 1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the rectangular prism formed by the pool. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is V = length * width * height. 

Given the dimensions of the pool (14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep), we can calculate the volume as follows:

V = length * width * height
V = 25 * 14 * 4
V = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the total gallons of water needed, we multiply the volume by 5.9:

1400 * 5.9 = 8230 gallons

Now, to find the cost of filling the pool, we multiply the total gallons of water needed by the cost per gallon ($0.10):

8230 * 0.10 = $823

The cost to fill the pool will be $823."
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to first determine the number of blue sticks and then the number of yellow sticks.

We know there are 9 red sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 + 14 + 11 = 34.

The total number of sticks is 34."
"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to calculate the distance each of them traveled.

Matteo's distance = speed * time = 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles

Shandy's distance = speed * time = 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles

The difference in distance = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the total number of female students, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old. Since there are 3000 students in total, half of them would be 3000 / 2 = 1500 students over 16 years old.

We are told that one-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male. So, the number of male students over 16 years old would be 1500 / 4 = 375.

Now, we know that the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old. This means the other half of the students are 1500 / 2 = 750 students under 16 years old.

We are also told that one-half of the students under 16 are male. So, the number of male students under 16 years old would be 750 / 2 = 375.

To find the total number of female students, we need to subtract the number of male students from the total number of students. 

The total number of male students is the sum of male students over 16 and under 16 years old, which is 375 + 375 = 750.

Now, subtracting the total number of male students from the total number of students, we get 3000 - 750 = 2250.

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is 2250."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many laps each person can run and then compare Bethany's laps to Quinn's.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's laps from Bethany's laps: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on each day.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped over the two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the amount of water remaining for the tank to be full is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we can break it down into two parts: the first part where the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour, and the second part where it loses 7% of its capacity per hour.

Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as x.

In the first part, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour for 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the charge remaining is (1 - 0.09)^5 * x.

In the second part, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity per hour for 3 hours. This means that after 3 hours, the charge remaining is (1 - 0.07)^3 * (1 - 0.09)^5 * x.

We are given that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 28%. So, we can set up the equation:

(1 - 0.09)^5 * x + (1 - 0.07)^3 * (1 - 0.09)^5 * x = 0.28

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(0.91)^5 * x + (0.93)^3 * (0.91)^5 * x = 0.28

Combine like terms:

(0.91)^5 * (1 + 0.93^3) * x = 0.28

Now, we can calculate the value of (0.91)^5 and (0.93)^3:

(0.91)^5 ≈ 0.5905
(0.93)^3 ≈ 0.8573

Substitute these values back into the equation:

0.5905 * (1 + 0.8573) * x = 0.28

0.5905 * 1.8573 * x = 0.28

1.095 * x = 0.28

x = 0.28 / 1.095

x ≈ 0.255

So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 25.5%.

The final answer is: 25.5"
"To determine the total amount Janet needs to save for the down payment, we need to calculate 20% of the car's price. 

20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

Since Janet earns $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, her total hourly wage is $10 + $15 = $25.

To find out how many hours she needs to work to save $2,000, we divide the amount she needs to save by her total hourly wage:

$2,000 / $25 = 80 hours

Since Janet works 40 hours a week, we divide the total hours she needs to work by her weekly hours:

80 hours / 40 hours/week = 2 weeks

Janet will need to work 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car.

"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has left after purchasing the fruits he already bought.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he already bought:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.75 each: 4 * $0.75 = $3
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he already bought: $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Since Jamaar started with $10, he has $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25 left. However, this is not possible as he cannot have a negative amount of money. This means he doesn't have enough money to buy any more fruits.

The final answer is 0."
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we need to first calculate the total number of sweets in the box. 

There are 15 packs in the box, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, the total number of sweets is 15 * 60 = 900.

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is 15 - 2 = 13.

Since she gave the sweets equally to 10 friends, we divide the total number of sweets by 10. 

900 / 10 = 90.

So, each of Anne's friends received 90 pieces of sweets."
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years, we need to apply the 5% annual increase to the initial price of $120 for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial price = $120
Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Initial price = $126
Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Initial price = $132.30
Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

The final answer is: 139"
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to first find the total number of pictures in each type of album. 

Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures by 8 to find the number of pictures in each album. 

72 / 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies only, and each album has 9 pictures, the number of selfies is 3 * 9 = 27.

The remaining albums are portraits, and there are 8 - 3 = 5 portraits. Since each portrait album also has 9 pictures, the number of portraits is 5 * 9 = 45.

Therefore, Olivia had 45 portraits and 27 selfies.

"To find the total time James spends reading, we need to calculate the time it takes him to read 18 pages. 

Since James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, we can find the time it takes him to read 1 page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages. 

10 minutes / 3 pages = 3.33 minutes per page

Now, we can multiply the time it takes to read 1 page by the total number of pages he read (18 pages). 

3.33 minutes per page * 18 pages = 60 minutes

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of guests who checked in and subtract the number of guests who checked out.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.

24 guests checked out, leaving 100 - 24 = 76 guests.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, so the number of guests who checked out is now 24 + 15 = 39.

Since twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, the number of guests who checked in is 2 * 15 = 30.

Additionally, 7 more people checked in after dinner, so the total number of guests who checked in is 30 + 7 = 37.

The total number of guests in the hotel now is 76 (remaining guests) + 37 (new guests) = 113.

The hotel now has 113 guests."
"To find the total number of bananas John has, we need to add the bananas he picked on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas.
On Thursday, he picked 6 bananas.
On Friday, he picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add the bananas: 4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas.

John has 22 bananas."
"To find the total number of easy questions, we can calculate 40% of 60, which is 0.4 * 60 = 24 questions. 

Since the rest of the questions are divided equally between average and difficult, we have 60 - 24 = 36 questions left. Half of these are average and half are difficult, so there are 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 0.75 * 24 = 18 questions. She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 0.5 * (18 + 18) = 18 questions.

So, Aries is sure to get 18 + 18 = 36 questions.

The final answer is: 36"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as L and the number of small stuffed animals sold as S. We know that S = 2L (since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones).

We also know that the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal, so the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total amount earned from the sales is $120. Since the price of a large stuffed animal is $12, the total amount earned from large stuffed animals is 12L. The total amount earned from small stuffed animals is 4S (since each small stuffed animal costs $4).

We can set up the equation: 12L + 4S = 120.

Substituting S = 2L into the equation, we get: 12L + 4(2L) = 120.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 12L + 8L = 120.

Combine like terms: 20L = 120.

Divide both sides by 20: L = 6.

Since S = 2L, S = 2 * 6 = 12.

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

"To find the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in one week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten per day and then multiply it by 7.

The total number of sandwiches eaten per day is: 
5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day.

Now, multiply the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by 7:
11 sandwiches/day * 7 days = 77 sandwiches.

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings first. 

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 * $1 = $80.
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 * $4 = $240.

Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave away a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

Now, we subtract the amount she gave away from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To find the number of eggs the friends found, we first need to determine the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins and the other individuals. 

The Smith twins found 30 eggs each, so together they found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

Since all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends, we need to subtract the 10 unaccounted eggs from the total number of eggs. 

The total number of eggs is 100. So, the number of eggs found by the friends is 100 - 10 = 90 eggs.

The friends found 90 eggs."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the amount of ore that 40 dwarves can mine with steel pickaxes in a day.

Since one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, 40 dwarves can mine 40 * 12 = 480 pounds of ore per day.

Since the problem states that 40 dwarves can mine 50% more ore with steel pickaxes than with iron pickaxes, we need to find the amount of ore that 40 dwarves can mine with iron pickaxes in a day. 

Let's denote the amount of ore that one dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe as x. Then, 40 dwarves can mine 40x pounds of ore per day.

Since 40 dwarves can mine 50% more ore with steel pickaxes than with iron pickaxes, we can set up the equation:

40x + 50% of 40x = 480

Simplifying the equation, we get:

40x + 20x = 480
60x = 480
x = 8

So, one dwarf can mine 8 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe.

Now, we can find the amount of ore that 40 dwarves can mine with iron pickaxes in a day:

40 * 8 = 320 pounds of ore per day

Since 40 dwarves can mine 50% more ore with steel pickaxes than with iron pickaxes, we can find the amount of ore that 40 dwarves can mine with steel pickaxes in a day:

320 + 50% of 320 = 320 + 160 = 480 pounds of ore per day

To find the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves can mine in a month with 30 days, we multiply the daily amount by 30:

480 * 30 = 14400 pounds of ore per month

The final answer is: 14400"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we can use the concept of proportionality. 

Let's denote the price of the package with 8 sandwiches as x. 

We know that the price of the package with 2 sandwiches is $3, and the price of the package with 4 sandwiches is $6. 

Since the prices are proportional, we can set up a proportion to relate the number of sandwiches to the price:

2 sandwiches / $3 = 4 sandwiches / $6 = 8 sandwiches / x

We can simplify the proportion by dividing both sides by 2:

1 / $3 = 2 / $6 = 4 / x

Now, we can cross-multiply:

6 = 2x
3 = x

So, the price of the package with 8 sandwiches is $3."
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to calculate the remaining amount he owes after using the $1000 he received from selling his old bedroom.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount received from selling the old bedroom: $1000
Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we can calculate the monthly payment as follows:

Monthly payment = 10% of $2000
Monthly payment = 0.10 * $2000
Monthly payment = $200

The final answer is: $200"
"To find the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons she had after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 
Number of red balloons that burst = 40% of 25 = 0.4 * 25 = 10
Number of red balloons remaining = 25 - 10 = 15

Then, she accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. 
Number of yellow balloons released = 1/2 * 12 = 6
Number of yellow balloons remaining = 12 - 6 = 6

Next, she found 8 blue balloons in the tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons. 
Number of blue balloons added = 75% of 8 = 0.75 * 8 = 6
Number of blue balloons remaining = 8 - 6 = 2 (since she found 8, but only 2 were added to her clutch)

Now, let's calculate the total number of balloons she carried into the school:
Number of red balloons = 15
Number of green balloons = 7
Number of yellow balloons = 6
Number of blue balloons = 2

Total number of balloons = 15 + 7 + 6 + 2 = 30

The final answer is 30."
"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the different scenarios and their probabilities.

Let's break it down:

1. The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 60% chance (100% - 40% chance of extension)
   - In this case, Marcus has to turn in his homework: 60% * 100% = 60%

2. The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 40% chance
   - In this case, Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework: 40% * 0% = 0%

3. The substitute teacher comes in: 50% chance
   - In this case, Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework: 50% * 0% = 0%

Now, we add up the probabilities of Marcus not having to turn in his homework in each scenario: 60% + 40% + 50% = 150%. However, since probabilities must be between 0% and 100%, we need to normalize this by dividing by 100% to get the percentage chance.

(60% + 40% + 50%) / 100% = 150% / 100% = 1.5

Since probabilities must be between 0% and 100%, we can round down to 150% and then subtract 100% to get the actual percentage chance: 150% - 100% = 50%

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 50%.

Final answer: 50%"
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to subtract the total number of reserved seats from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Total capacity = 6000
Reserved seats for graduates = 950
Reserved seats for faculty = 300
Total reserved seats = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now, subtract the total reserved seats from the total capacity:
6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive:
4750 / 950 = 5

Therefore, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of large, medium, and small jelly beans. 

We know that it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, the number of medium-sized beans is 2 * 75 = 150.

We also know that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean. Therefore, the number of small beans that equals 1 medium-sized bean is 3. To find the total number of small beans that equals 150 medium-sized beans, we multiply 150 by 3, which gives us 450.

So, Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly beans.

"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can place along the driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes to move from one bottle to the next.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the width of the driveway by the spacing between the bottles:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school and the total amount of money he earned after graduating.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school. Since it takes him 4 years to finish college and he gets $50,000 in loans per year, the total amount of money he lost is:

$50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim earned after graduating. Since his college degree tripled his income, and he had a $25,000 per year job before college, his new income is:

$25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year

Since he worked for 4 years after graduating, the total amount of money he earned is:

$75,000/year * 4 years = $300,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay off the loans and the money lost while in school. This is the sum of the total amount of money he lost and the total amount of money he earned:

$200,000 (lost) + $300,000 (earned) = $500,000

To find out how long it would take Jim to earn this amount, we can divide the total amount by his new income:

$500,000 / $75,000/year = 6.67 years

So, it would take Jim approximately 6.67 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost while in school.

Final answer: 6.67"
"To find the total amount of fabric needed, we need to calculate the area of the two pieces of fabric. 

First, we calculate the area of the bed: 
6 feet (length) * 8 feet (width) = 48 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider, we add 2 feet to both the length and width of the bed:
New length: 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
New width: 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we calculate the area of the two pieces of fabric:
8 feet (length) * 10 feet (width) = 80 square feet per piece
Since Jim needs two pieces, we multiply the area by 2:
80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs 160 square feet of fabric to make the comforter.

"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. 
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery. 
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Now, let's add the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday: 
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

The total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is 736."

"To find the average amount Johnny lost, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

In the first race, he lost $5.

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Since he lost $5 in the first race, he won $2 * $5 + $1 = $11 in the second race.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. Since he won $11 in the second race, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.5 in the third race.

Now, let's calculate the total amount he lost: $5 (first race) + $16.5 (third race) = $21.5

To find the average amount he lost, we divide the total amount by the number of races: $21.5 / 3 = $7.17

"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their new heights after the growth.

Xavier's new height: 4 feet + 3 inches = 4 feet + 0.25 feet (since 1 foot = 12 inches, 3 inches = 0.25 feet) = 4.25 feet
Cole's new height: 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches = 4.33 feet (since 1 foot = 12 inches, 52 inches = 4.33 feet)

Now, we can find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier:
Difference = Cole's height - Xavier's height = 4.33 feet - 4.25 feet = 0.08 feet

To convert the difference to inches, we multiply by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
0.08 feet * 12 inches/foot = 0.96 inches

The difference in height between Cole and Xavier is 0.96 inches."
"To find the share of the first person, we need to first find the amount taken by the second and third person.

Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as x. 

The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the amount taken by the second person is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the amount taken by the third person is 2(x + 80).

The sum of the amounts taken by all three people is $1920. 

We can write the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms: 
x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine like terms: 
4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides: 
4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4: 
x = 420

So, the amount taken by the first person is $420.

"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters.

First, we need to find the total hours worked by the team. Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks, we need to convert the fraction to a decimal and multiply it by the number of days in 3 weeks.

There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is 3 x 7 = 21 days. 

3/8 of a day is equivalent to 0.375 days. 

Now, we multiply 0.375 days by 21 days: 
0.375 * 21 = 7.875 days

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply 7.875 days by 24 hours:
7.875 * 24 = 189 hours

Now, we divide the total hours worked by the number of painters (4):
189 / 4 = 47.25 hours

The final answer is 47.25."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can first multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Expanding the equation:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set, which is x + 4:

6 + 4 = 10

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set of the match.

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010.

Year 2007: 
Initial price = $20,000
Depreciation = 21% of $20,000 = 0.21 * $20,000 = $4,200
Price in 2007 = $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800

Year 2008:
Depreciation = 21% of $15,800 = 0.21 * $15,800 = $3,318
Price in 2008 = $15,800 - $3,318 = $12,482

Year 2009:
Depreciation = 21% of $12,482 = 0.21 * $12,482 = $2,600.82
Price in 2009 = $12,482 - $2,600.82 = $9,881.18

Year 2010:
Depreciation = 21% of $9,881.18 = 0.21 * $9,881.18 = $2,066.63
Price in 2010 = $9,881.18 - $2,066.63 = $7,814.55

The price of the car in 2010 is $7,814.55."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to determine the total number of books written in English and German. 

Half of the 50 books are written in English, so the number of English books is 50 / 2 = 25.

10% of the 50 books are written in German, so the number of German books is 0.1 * 50 = 5.

Now, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books to find the number of Spanish books: 50 - 25 - 5 = 20.

Therefore, there are 20 Spanish books in the library.

"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven (325 kilometers) from the total distance between San Diego and New York City (1955 kilometers).

First, let's calculate the remaining distance:
1955 km (total distance) - 325 km (distance driven) = 1630 km

So, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers.

1630"
"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first calculate the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Since Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day, we multiply the number of cups she drinks per day by the number of days: 
8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups

Now, we need to convert the total number of cups to gallons. Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we divide the total number of cups by 16:
240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to track the number of people on the train at each stop.

Initially, Romeo boards the train with 120 people.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the total number of people becomes 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (100) board the train. So, the total number of people becomes 140 - 50 + 100 = 190.

At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the total number of people becomes 190 - 80 = 110.

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110.

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total cost of the athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The tank top costs $10.
The pair of running shorts costs $5 more than the tank top, so it costs $10 + $5 = $15.
The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
The package of athletic socks originally costs $8, but Alison had a $2 coupon, so she paid $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55.

The total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is $55."
"To find the total cost of renovating your kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and then multiply it by the cost per tile.

Since each tile is 1ft in length and your kitchen floor is 200 SqFt, we can calculate the total number of tiles required as follows:

Area of the floor = 200 SqFt
Area of each tile = 1ft * 1ft = 1 SqFt
Total number of tiles required = Area of the floor / Area of each tile
Total number of tiles required = 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt = 200 tiles

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the total number of tiles required by the cost per tile:

Total cost = Total number of tiles required * Cost per tile
Total cost = 200 tiles * $12
Total cost = $2400

Therefore, it will cost you $2400 to renovate your kitchen floor with square tiles."
"To find the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

60% of $120 is 0.6 * $120 = $72. 

The increased cost is $120 + $72 = $192. 

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we multiply the increased cost by 12. 

$192 * 12 = $2304.

The final answer is: $2304"
"To determine the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the total number of sets of sheets he does in a year and then divide that by the number of loads his machine can handle.

First, let's calculate the total number of sets of sheets Greg does in a week. He does 4 twin sets and 1 king set, so that's 4 + 1 = 5 sets per week.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of sets of sheets he does in a year is 5 sets/week * 52 weeks/year = 260 sets/year.

Now, let's calculate the number of loads he needs to do in a year. His machine can handle 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, so the total number of loads per week is (2 + 1) = 3 loads/week.

The total number of loads he does in a year is 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year.

Therefore, Greg does 156 loads of laundry in a year.

"To find the total number of movies watched in a weekend, we need to calculate the number of movies watched on Saturday and Sunday separately.

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies. 
On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in a weekend, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

Since there are 4 weekends in a month, the total number of movies watched in 4 weeks is 6 * 4 = 24 movies.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to calculate the number of stickers he collected each year and add them together.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.

Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers, so he now has 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.

This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Now, we add the stickers from each year: 150 + 100 = 250 stickers.

Leo has 250 stickers in his collection.

"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the daily amount Imma feeds her cats (60 grams).

720 grams / 60 grams per day = 12 days

The cat food will last 12 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many slices Jake ate. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, and Becky ate 10 slices, we can set up an equation to find Jake's slices:

Becky's slices = Jake's slices + 3
10 = Jake's slices + 3
Jake's slices = 10 - 3
Jake's slices = 7

Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, we can calculate Silvia's slices:

Silvia's slices = 2 * Jake's slices
Silvia's slices = 2 * 7
Silvia's slices = 14

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:

Total slices = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices = 10 + 7 + 14
Total slices = 31

The total number of slices eaten is 31."
"To solve this problem, let's denote Donovan's part as 'x'. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part can be represented as 'x + 18'. 

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 18) = 98.

Combine like terms: 2x + 18 = 98.

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

Since Betsy's part is x + 18, we can substitute x with 40: Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = 58.

The final answer is 58."
"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of the visit, the cost of the cast, the cost of the painkillers, and the cost of parking.

First, let's calculate the cost of the visit. The doctor charges $300/hour for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the painkillers. The doctor charges $4/pill for 30 painkillers, so the total cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

Now, let's calculate the cost of parking. The doctor charges $6/hour for 2 hours, so the total cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Finally, let's add up the costs: the cost of the visit ($150), the cost of the cast ($200), the cost of the painkillers ($120), and the cost of parking ($12). The total cost of the doctor's visit is $150 + $200 + $120 + $12 = $482.

"To find the number of emails James responds to, we first need to calculate the number of emails that require a response. 

20% of 80 emails don't require a response, so we calculate 20% of 80 as 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails. 

The remaining emails that require a response are 80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Since James works 5 days a week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to per day by 5. 

64 * 5 = 320

James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes that visited each day and then add them together.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add the number of classes that visited each day:
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247

Therefore, a total of 247 classes visited the Science Center last week.

"To find out how many pizzas are left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas each group ate and subtract that from the total number of pizzas.

The glee club ate 70% of 20 pizzas, which is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas.

The football team ate 80% of twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 80% of 40 pizzas is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas eaten is 14 (glee club) + 32 (football team) = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 + 40 = 60 pizzas.

To find out how many pizzas are left, we subtract the total number of pizzas eaten from the total number of pizzas ordered: 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the number of small and big coupons, then multiply each by its respective cost and add them together.

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons, so he will send out 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.

The cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.
The cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of small and big coupons together: 3500 + 21000 = 24500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

The total cost of postage is 245 dollars."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. This means Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

Then, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. So, the number of meatball sub sandwiches remaining is 7 - 4 = 3.

Since each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining 3 sub sandwiches is 3 * 4 = 12.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total number of trucks that could not deliver the fertiliser, we need to calculate a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched. 

A quarter of 20 trucks is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered is 5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons.

The total number of trucks that could deliver the fertiliser is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons.

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons.

"To determine the cost of the butter, we first need to calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs. Since he needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store is offering a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every two pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds. 

To calculate the cost, we can divide the total amount of butter needed (6 pounds) by 2, since the promotion is for every two pounds. 6 / 2 = 3. 

Since Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds of butter for every 2 pounds, and he needs 6 pounds, he will pay for 3 sets of 1.5 pounds. 

The cost of 1.5 pounds of butter is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00. Since he is buying 3 sets of 1.5 pounds, the total cost will be 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.

The final answer is: $6.00"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of guests first. Kayla invited 25 classmates and 7 girls from her dance class, which is a total of 25 + 7 = 32 guests. However, 4 people said they couldn't come, so the actual number of guests is 32 - 4 = 28.

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. Since there are 28 guests, we need to calculate the cost for the additional guests. The number of additional guests is 28 - 20 = 8.

The cost for the additional guests is 8 * $6 = $48. Adding this to the initial fee, the total cost is $125 + $48 = $173.

The final answer is: $173"
"To find out how much money Maggie and Riza have left, we need to first determine how much money they initially had. Since they each had $60, the total amount of money they had is $60 + $60 = $120.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 * $60 = $15. 
Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 * $60 = $20.

The total amount of money they spent is $15 + $20 = $35.

To find out how much money they have left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $120 - $35 = $85.

The two of them have $85 left."
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine the total number of bananas each monkey eats in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

Since the total number of bananas is 315, we can subtract the bananas eaten by the first two monkeys to find out how many bananas are left for the third monkey. 

315 - 10 (first monkey) - 14 (second monkey) = 291 bananas left for the third monkey.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the remaining bananas by 7 to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats per day.

291 / 7 = 41.57 bananas per day.

So, the third monkey eats approximately 41.57 bananas per day."

"To find out how many quarters Jenny will leave with, we first need to calculate the total cost of the roses. 

Since a dozen roses costs $15, 15 roses will cost 15 * 1.25 = $18.75. 

Jenny has 5 dollars, so she needs to pay $18.75 - $5 = $13.75. 

Since the florist only accepts quarters for change, we need to convert $13.75 to quarters. 

There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so 13 dollars is 13 * 4 = 52 quarters. 

The remaining 75 cents is equivalent to 0.75 * 4 = 3 quarters.

Therefore, Jenny will leave with 52 + 3 = 55 quarters."

"To determine the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the time elapsed between the first train's arrival and the fourth train's departure.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the time elapsed until the second train arrives is 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves, which means it arrives 30 minutes after the first train's scheduled arrival time. Since the first train arrives in 10 minutes, the second train arrives at 10 + 30 = 40 minutes.

3. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 40 + 20 = 60 minutes.

4. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which means it arrives 60 minutes after the second train's scheduled arrival time. Since the second train arrives at 40 minutes, the third train arrives at 40 + 60 = 100 minutes.

5. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which means it arrives 20 minutes after the third train's scheduled departure time. Since the third train leaves at 100 minutes, the fourth train arrives at 100 + 20 = 120 minutes.

Now, we need to calculate the total waiting time for Paul. He waits for the first train to arrive (10 minutes), then waits for the second train to arrive (30 minutes), then waits for the third train to arrive (60 minutes), and finally waits for the fourth train to arrive (20 minutes). 

The total waiting time is 10 + 30 + 60 + 20 = 120 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we need to first determine how many toothpicks she has already collected. 

Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has collected is 10 * 12 = 120.

Since she needs 200 toothpicks in total, we subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total: 200 - 120 = 80.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks at the same rate of 10 toothpicks per week. 

To do this, we divide the remaining toothpicks by the number of toothpicks she saves per week: 80 / 10 = 8.

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we need to calculate the original price of the watch and the price at which he sold it to his friend.

Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price. Let's denote the original price as x. 

75% of x = 2000
0.75x = 2000
x = 2000 / 0.75
x = 2666.67

So, the original price of the watch is $2666.67.

Mr. Rogers then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it. 
120% of 2666.67 = 1.2 * 2666.67 = 3200

The price at which Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend is $3200.

To find the percentage discount, we need to find the difference between the original price and the selling price, and then divide it by the original price.

Discount = Original price - Selling price
= 2666.67 - 3200
= -533.33

However, since we are looking for the percentage discount, we need to divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100.

Percentage discount = (Discount / Original price) * 100
= (-533.33 / 2666.67) * 100
= -20%

Since the percentage cannot be negative, we can say that Mr. Rogers' friend obtained a 20% discount from the original price."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we need to determine the rate at which the springs create jellyfish. Since every second, a spring creates a new jellyfish, we can say that each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second.

Since there are 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created per second is 5.

Now, we need to convert the time from hours to seconds. There are 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.

We are given that the time is 4 hours, so we multiply the number of jellyfish created per second by the number of seconds in 4 hours: 5 jellyfish/second * 3600 seconds = 18000 jellyfish.

Therefore, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 18000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it took James to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.

First, let's calculate the time it took James to walk to the store. Since he walked 4 miles at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

So, it took James 1 hour to walk to the store.

Next, let's calculate the time it took James to walk back home. Since he walked the same distance (4 miles) at the same speed (4 miles per hour), the time it took him to walk back home is also 1 hour.

Now, we need to add the time it took James to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home to get the total time:

Total time = Time to walk to the store + Time to walk back home
Total time = 1 hour + 1 hour
Total time = 2 hours

Therefore, it took James 2 hours to reach the store.

"To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the bananas individually and then subtract the total cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's calculate the total cost of buying the bananas individually. Since there are 10 bunches and each bunch contains 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is 10 * 4 = 40. The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

Next, we calculate the total cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Since each bunch costs $3.00 and Jenny buys 10 bunches, the total cost is 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

Now, we subtract the total cost of buying in bunches from the total cost of buying individually to find the amount saved: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total amount of fence that Sam and Harry will get. Since they are splitting the fence, we can represent the amount of fence Sam gets as 'x'. Then, Harry gets 'x + 60' feet of fence.

Since the total length of the fence is 100 feet, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

To find out how much is left over for Sam, we subtract the amount he gets from the total length of the fence:

100 - 20 = 80

The answer is 80."
"To find the rate of growth, we need to divide the total growth (8 inches) by the number of years (4). 

8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year

2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

The crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply that by its price.

First, we know that half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes. So, the number of Trekking bikes sold is 300 / 2 = 150.

We also know that 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes. To find the number of BMX bikes sold, we multiply 300 by 0.15: 300 * 0.15 = 45.

Now, we can find the number of MTB bikes sold by subtracting the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total: 300 - 150 - 45 = 105.

The prices of the bikes are $500 for MTB, $250 for BMX (half of $500), and $450 for Trekking.

To find the total earnings, we multiply the number of each type of bike by its price and add them together: 
(105 * 500) + (45 * 250) + (150 * 450) = 52500 + 11250 + 67500 = 106250.

The total earnings from selling bicycles during that month is $106250."
"To determine the number of bales left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made and picked up in 6 hours.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

To find the number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total minutes John spends in classes, we first need to calculate the total minutes he spends in classes per week. 

There are 5 days of classes, and each class is 40 minutes long. So, the total minutes spent in classes per week is 5 * 40 = 200 minutes.

Since John also spends extra time on Saturday and Sunday, we need to calculate the extra minutes spent on these days. There are 2 days, and he spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these days. 

First, we need to find the total minutes in a week. There are 24 hours in a day, and 60 minutes in an hour. So, there are 24 * 60 = 1440 minutes in a week. 

Now, we can find the total minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday. 1/16 of 1440 is 1440 / 16 = 90 minutes. 

So, the total minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday is 90 minutes. 

Now, we can find the total minutes spent on learning per week. This is the sum of the minutes spent in classes and the extra minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday. 

Total minutes spent on learning per week = 200 + 90 = 290 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60. 

290 / 60 = 4.83 hours.

The final answer is 4.83."
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height it reaches after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is 3 stories, which is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

After the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of its initial height, which is (2/3) * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of the height it reached after the first bounce, which is (2/3) * 48 = 32 feet.

Therefore, the ball goes 32 feet on its second bounce.

32"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child in inches.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The final answer is 72."
"To find the total earnings, we need to divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10) to determine the number of bags sold. 

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Since each bag is sold at $5, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples."
"To find the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards from the last known amount.

The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms of meat, so the amount left after the T-Rex ate was 270 kilograms.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the amount left after the T-Rex ate was half of the initial amount. Let's call the initial amount 'x'. 

We can set up the equation: x / 2 = 270

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2: x = 270 * 2
x = 540

So, the triceratops had 540 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate.

The final answer is: 540"
"To find the total area to be painted, we need to calculate the area of each wall and then sum them up. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, their combined area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of them, their combined area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

The total area to be painted is the sum of the areas of all four walls: 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost will be 12 x $12 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To determine the likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the number of shaken and unshaken sodas left.

Initially, Ellen shook 3 sodas and left 9 unshaken. Her brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 9 - 2 = 7 unshaken sodas and 3 - 1 = 2 shaken sodas.

Ellen's friend can choose from the 7 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas. The total number of sodas left is 7 + 2 = 9.

The probability of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas, which is 2/9.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (2/9) * 100 = 22.22%."
"To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them. 

The total distance between the two trains is 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

270"
"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we need to calculate the number of days he is available to help and then multiply it by the number of people he can help per hour.

There are 31 days in March. Billy takes 20% of the days off, which is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round down to 6 days off.

So, Billy is available to help for 31 - 6 = 25 days.

He can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, which means he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of days he is available to help by the number of people he can help per day: 25 * 6 = 150.

Therefore, Billy can help 150 people.

"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars.

First, let's calculate the total number of people in the buses:
12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people in the cars:
20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Now, we add the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars to find the total number of people outside the church:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the total number of people outside the church from the total number of people:
480 people - 480 people = 0 people

The final answer is: 0"
"To find Jeff's age, we need to work backwards from Mike's age. 

Since Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, and Mike is 24 years old, Martha's age can be calculated as: 
24 - 4 = 20

Since Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, Jeff's age can be calculated as: 
20 + 10 = 30

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old.

"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: Time = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide: Time = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide: 
Difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer to ride compared to the second biggest slide."
"To find the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total minutes and then convert it to hours.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 x 15-minute breaks per day. 

Total minutes per day = 30 + (2 x 15) = 30 + 30 = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

Total hours per day = 60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Since this is for 5 days, we multiply the total hours per day by 5.

Total hours for 5 days = 1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many miles Micah ran, we need to multiply Amber's distance by 3.5. 

Amber ran 8 miles. 
Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so Micah ran 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles.

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We can subtract the distance run by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

52 - 8 - 28 = 16 miles.

Ahito ran 16 miles."
"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after the discounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan:
Original price: $20.00
Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Discounted price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the towels:
Original price: $30.00
Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
Discounted price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items purchased:
Cost of frying pan: $16.00
Cost of towels: $27.00
Total cost: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card and returned $15.00, so the new balance before the new purchases is:
$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Now, let's add the total cost of the new purchases to the new balance:
$70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, we can start by identifying the information given:

- A fifth of the jellyfish are large.
- A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light.
- The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue.
- When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5. A third of these large jellyfish change color, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5)/3 = x/15.

Since the remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue, the number of small jellyfish is x - (x/5) = 4x/5.

We know that the total number of jellyfish that change color is 6. This includes both the large jellyfish that change color and the small jellyfish that do not change color. Since the small jellyfish always stay blue, the number of small jellyfish that change color is 0. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is 6.

We can set up the equation: x/15 = 6.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 15: x = 6 * 15 = 90.

Therefore, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

90"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the age relationships between Caroline, Ben, and Chris. 

We know that Chris is 4 years old. Since Ben is two times older than Chris, we can calculate Ben's age as follows: 
Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now, we know that Caroline is three times older than Ben. So, we can calculate Caroline's age as follows:
Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we first need to calculate her annual savings. Since she saves 20% of her current salary, her annual savings would be 20% of $100,000, which is 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000.

Next, we need to calculate her annual expenses. Since she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, her annual expenses would be 40% of $100,000, which is 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000.

Now, we can calculate her annual savings after expenses, which is $20,000 - $40,000 = -$20,000. This means she is actually spending more than she is saving, which is not possible. However, assuming she wants to save for a retirement period of 20 years, we can calculate the total amount she needs to save.

Since she can't save more than she earns, let's assume she saves the maximum amount possible, which is her annual salary minus her expenses. Her annual savings would be $100,000 - $40,000 = $60,000.

Now, we can calculate the total amount she needs to save for 20 years, which is $60,000 * 20 = $1,200,000.

Since she can only save $60,000 per year, we can calculate the number of years she needs to work to save $1,200,000 by dividing the total amount by her annual savings: $1,200,000 / $60,000 = 20 years.

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save the required amount, but she already has 0 years of work experience. Therefore, she needs to work for 20 years to save the required amount.

Final answer: 20"
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to break down the problem into steps. 

First, we divide the 100 centimeters of ribbon into 4 equal parts. This means we divide 100 by 4, which equals 25 centimeters per part.

Next, we take each of these 4 parts and divide them into 5 equal parts. This means we divide 25 by 5, which equals 5 centimeters per final cut.

So, the length of each final cut will be 5 centimeters.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we can set up a proportion. Let's denote the total number of students as 'x'. 

Since 40% of the students are boys, and there are 240 boys, we can write the equation as:

40% of x = 240

To solve for x, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:

0.4x = 240

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.4 to isolate x:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

The number of girls in the school is the total number of students minus the number of boys:

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how much money your mom spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then subtract the coupon discount.

So, your mom spent $38 at the gardening shop."
"To find the average height of heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide it by the total number of heels.

The total height of heels is the sum of the heights of the heels worn by the 3 women wearing 4 inch heels and the 3 women wearing 2 inch heels.

Total height = (3 x 4) + (3 x 2)
Total height = 12 + 6
Total height = 18

There are a total of 6 heels at the party.

Average height = Total height / Total number of heels
Average height = 18 / 6
Average height = 3

The average height of heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days. To find out how many miles she needs to hike per day, we divide the total miles by the number of days:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is already hiking 125 miles per day, we subtract this from the required daily amount to find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day:

310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 185 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

Final answer: 185"

Total revenue = $27 + $55 + $75 = $157

The store will have received $157 after all the balls are sold."
"To find out how much each person gets, we need to calculate the amount each person wants.

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg.

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

Since Jacques is not mentioned in the question, we can assume that Jacques is the one left with the remaining amount. 

The total amount taken by Pierre and Paul is 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

So, Jacques will have 12 - 7 = 5 kg left.

"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first determine the total amount Anna spent on the books. 

Anna started with a budget of $16 and had $2 left after buying the books. This means she spent $16 - $2 = $14 on the books.

Since she bought 2 books for the same amount, we can divide the total amount spent ($14) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

$14 ÷ 2 = $7

So, each book cost $7.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how far Brian will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, we can set up an equation. 

Let's denote the distance Brian walks in 7 days as 'x'. Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, the distance Sofie walks in 7 days is 2x.

We know that Sofie walks 10 miles every day, so in 7 days, she will walk 10 * 7 = 70 miles. 

Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, we can set up the equation: 2x = 70

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 70 / 2 = 35

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers. 

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys per hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys. 
The 2 workers who produce 4 toys per hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys. 
The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, the total number of toys needed is 200 + 20 = 220 toys.

Since there are 5 workers in total, and 4 of them produce 200 toys, the fifth worker must produce 220 - 200 = 20 toys in 10 hours.

To find the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker (20) by the number of hours worked (10). 

20 / 10 = 2 toys per hour.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the weight of Elijah's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of both dogs to find the total weight: 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

The total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is 45 pounds.

"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to calculate the total weight of the large bags and then multiply it by the number of M&M's per ounce.

Each large bag weighs 10 ounces, and there are 3 large bags. So, the total weight is 3 * 10 = 30 ounces.

Since each ounce contains 30 M&M's, the total number of M&M's is 30 * 30 = 900.

John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag. To find the number of small bags, we divide the total number of M&M's by 10.

Number of small bags = Total M&M's / 10 = 900 / 10 = 90.

The final answer is 90."
"To find the number of days it will take Alfie to fly half the circumference of the earth, we need to divide the distance of half the circumference by the distance Alfie flies per day.

Half the circumference of the earth is 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.

Now, we divide the distance by the distance Alfie flies per day: 20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days.

"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, we know the average car's speed is 120 Miles per hour. 

Since the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, we can calculate its speed by multiplying the average car's speed by 5.
2nd fastest car's speed = 5 * 120 = 600 Miles per hour.

Now, we know the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. To find the speed of the faster car, we multiply the 2nd fastest car's speed by 1.25.
Faster car's speed = 1.25 * 600 = 750 Miles per hour.

"To find Vince's current age, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as 'x'. Then, Liam's age two years ago was 2x.

Since Liam is 16 now, we can set up the equation: 16 = 2x + 2 (because Liam is 2 years older than he was 2 years ago).

Solving for x, we get: 2x = 14, x = 7.

So, Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 to 7: 7 + 2 = 9.

Vince is 9 years old now.

1. A = M (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)
2. C + S = 30 (Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)
3. C = S + 12 (Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah)

We can substitute the first equation into the third equation to get:
A = M = S + 12

Now, we can substitute the value of A and M into the second equation:
(S + 12) + S = 30
Combine like terms:
2S + 12 = 30
Subtract 12 from both sides:
2S = 18
Divide both sides by 2:
S = 9

Now that we know S, we can find C:
C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Now that we know C, we can find A:
A = M = S + 12
A = 9 + 12
A = 21

Now that we know A and C, we can find the difference:
Difference = C - A
Difference = 21 - 21
Difference = 0

The final answer is: 0"
"To find the total weight of the crayons, we need to calculate the number of boxes Nik can fill with crayons. Since each box can hold 8 crayons, we divide the total number of crayons by 8.

200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, we multiply the number of boxes by the weight per box to find the total weight of the crayons.

25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces

Now, we need to convert the weight of the crayons from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we divide the total weight in ounces by 16.

200 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 12.5 pounds

The total weight of the crayons is 12.5 pounds. Since the boxes also weigh 8 ounces each, we need to find the total weight of the boxes. 

25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces

Converting the weight of the boxes to pounds:

200 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 12.5 pounds

The total weight of the crayons and boxes is 12.5 pounds (crayons) + 12.5 pounds (boxes) = 25 pounds.

"To find out how many logs John can make from the tree, we need to divide the total length of the tree by the length of each log. 

80 feet (total length of the tree) / 4 feet (length of each log) = 20 logs

Since John can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we need to find 80% of 20 logs.

80% of 20 logs = 0.8 * 20 = 16 logs

Now, we need to find out how many planks John can make from each log. He cuts 5 planks from each log.

16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks

Finally, we can calculate the total amount John makes by multiplying the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 planks * $1.2/plank = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to first find the salaries of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of her brother's salary. So, her brother's salary is 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is 2 * ($5000 + $10,000) = 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

Now, we add up their salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The total amount of money they all have together is $40,000.

40,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the time spent on the sidewalk. 

Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, let's denote the speed on the beach as x miles per minute. Then, the speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that the time spent on the beach is 40 minutes, so the distance covered on the beach is 2x * 40 = 80x miles.

The total distance covered is 3 miles, and 80x miles is covered on the beach, so the distance covered on the sidewalk is 3 - 80x miles.

Since the distance covered on the sidewalk is 1 mile, we can set up the equation: 3 - 80x = 1.

Solving for x, we get 80x = 2, and x = 1/40 miles per minute.

Now, we can find the time spent on the sidewalk: 1 / (2 * 1/40) = 1 / (1/20) = 20 minutes.

The total time spent on the walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk: 40 + 20 = 60 minutes.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we need to first calculate how much she has saved so far. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved is 4 * 8 = $32.

Since she wants to save a total of $60, we need to subtract the amount she has already saved from the target amount: 60 - 32 = $28.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take to save the remaining amount. To do this, we divide the remaining amount by the amount she saves per week: 28 / 4 = 7.

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add the number of blue birds in each tree.

Three trees had 7 blue birds each, so 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds.

Two trees had 4 blue birds each, so 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds.

One tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the total number of blue birds: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many marbles Bob originally had. 

We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 * 12 = 24. 

So, if he receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. To find out how many marbles he originally had, we subtract 24 from 60. 

60 - 24 = 36

Now, we know that Bob originally had 36 marbles. 

If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, we subtract 10 from 36. 

36 - 10 = 26

Therefore, Bob will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, let's start by identifying the amount of water Donny has in each mug. We know he has two mugs, but we don't know the total amount of water in each mug. However, we do know that he pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug, and this combination makes the water drinkable.

Let's denote the amount of water in the 33-degree mug as x ounces. Since Donny pours 4 ounces from this mug, the amount of water left in the 33-degree mug is (x - 4) ounces.

We also know that the total amount of water Donny has is 2 mugs, so the amount of water in the other mug is 2 - (x - 4) = 6 - x ounces.

Since Donny can drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug, the temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees. 

We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

(x - 4) + (6 - x) + 1 ≥ 40

Simplifying the equation, we get:

7 - 4 ≥ 40

This equation is not solvable, as it simplifies to 3 ≥ 40, which is a contradiction. This means that the initial assumption that the water in the other mug is 6 - x ounces is incorrect.

However, we can re-evaluate the situation. If the water in the other mug is x ounces, then the amount of water Donny pours from this mug is x ounces. The total amount of water Donny pours is 4 + x ounces.

Since Donny can drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and x ounces from the other mug, the temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees. 

We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

(x - 4) + (x) ≥ 40

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x - 4 ≥ 40

2x ≥ 44

x ≥ 22

Since x represents the amount of water in the other mug, it must be a non-negative value. Therefore, the minimum value of x is 22.

The amount of water in the other mug is x = 22 ounces. 

The temperature of the water in the other mug is at least 40 degrees, so the minimum temperature is 40 degrees.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.

Melkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day, so in three weeks (21 days), they bring 20 * 21 = 420 cows.

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day, so in three weeks (21 days), they bring 10 * 21 = 210 chickens.

Now, let's add the initial number of animals to the number of animals added:

Cows: 50 + 420 = 470
Chickens: 20 + 210 = 230

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 470 cows and 230 chickens.

Total number of animals = 470 + 230 = 700"
"To find the total cost of 4 packs of bagels, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs. 

Since each pack costs $10.00, the total cost of 4 packs is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to calculate the discount amount. The discount is 10% of $40.00, which is 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.

The total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Now, we need to find the cost of each bagel. Since there are 9 bagels in each pack, the total number of bagels is 4 * 9 = 36.

To find the cost of each bagel, we divide the total cost after the discount by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

The final answer is $1.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we need to find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

Let's start by finding out how many scoops 3 less than 3 scoops is. Since 3 less than 3 scoops is 0 scoops, we can say that 3 less than 6 potatoes makes 0 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we know that 3 less than 6 potatoes makes 0 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes are needed to make 0 scoops, we can divide 3 by 3, which equals 1. This means that 3 potatoes are needed to make 0 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we know that 3 potatoes make 0 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many scoops 1 less than 3 scoops is, we can subtract 1 from 3, which equals 2 scoops.

Now, we know that 3 potatoes make 0 scoops of mashed potatoes, and 1 less than 3 scoops is 2 scoops. To find out how many potatoes are needed to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes, we can divide 2 by 0.5 (since 3 potatoes make 0.5 scoops), which equals 4 potatoes.

Now, we know that 4 potatoes are needed to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. We are given that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many scoops Gomer ate, we can subtract 5 from 23, which equals 18 scoops.

Now, we know that 4 potatoes are needed to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes, and Gomer ate 18 scoops. To find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we can multiply 18 scoops by 4/2, which equals 18 potatoes.

The final answer is: 18"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in 30 days is 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in 30 days is 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

Now, we add the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days: 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can convert 240 eggs to dozens by dividing by 12: 240 / 12 = 20.

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to determine the total number of red jellybeans. Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

Now, we know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total to find the number of blue jellybeans. 

60 (total) - 17 (green) - 34 (red) = 9

Therefore, there are 9 blue jellybeans in the jar."
"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the number of lemons he gets in a year and then multiply it by 10.

Since Tim grows 5 trees and each tree yields 6 lemons per year, the total number of lemons he gets in a year is 5 * 6 = 30.

To find the total number of lemons in a decade, we multiply the annual amount by 10: 30 * 10 = 300.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the number of women who have remained on the bus, we first need to determine the total number of women on the bus initially. 

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means that for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total number of parts in the ratio is 5 + 9 = 14. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can divide 84 by 14 to find the value of one part of the ratio. 

84 / 14 = 6

Now, we multiply the value of one part by the number of parts representing women in the ratio to find the initial number of women on the bus. 

9 parts * 6 = 54

Since 20 women alight from the bus, we subtract 20 from the initial number of women to find the number of women who have remained on the bus. 

54 - 20 = 34

The number of women who have remained on the bus is 34."

"To determine the amount of money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys and the revenue he generates from selling 60% of his inventory.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks. Since Adam has $100 and buys rocks for $5 each, we can divide the total amount by the cost per rock to find the number of rocks he buys:

$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling 60% of his inventory. 60% of 20 rocks is:

20 * 0.6 = 12 rocks

Since he sells each rock for $7, the total revenue is:

12 rocks * $7 = $84

Now, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the loss:

$84 (revenue) - $100 (cost) = -$16

Adam loses $16.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as 0.20 in decimal form.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is 3 * 0.20 = 0.60.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning: 0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

The final answer is 12%."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many seashells each person collected. 

Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as 'x'. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, Carlos collected 2x seashells. 

We know that Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so Jim collected 2x + 5 seashells.

We also know that the total number of seashells collected is the sum of the seashells collected by each person. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + (2x + 5) = Total number of seashells

Combine like terms:

5x + 5 = Total number of seashells

Since we don't know the total number of seashells, we need more information. However, we can express the total number of seashells in terms of 'x'. Let's say the total number of seashells is 'T'. Then:

T = 5x + 5

Now, we know that they divided the seashells equally among themselves, so each person got T/3 seashells.

Since we don't know the total number of seashells, we can't find the exact number of seashells each person got. However, we can express it in terms of 'x':

Each person got (5x + 5)/3 seashells.

To find the value of 'x', we need more information. However, we can express the number of seashells each person got in terms of 'x'."
"To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday, and there are 2 weekend days. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 * 2 = 10.

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week. 20 + 10 = 30.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. Since the second song is 60% longer than the first song, we can calculate its length as follows:

Length of the second song = Length of the first song + (60% of the length of the first song)
= 5 minutes + (0.6 * 5 minutes)
= 5 minutes + 3 minutes
= 8 minutes

Now, we can find the total time of the cassette by adding the lengths of both songs:

Total time = Length of the first song + Length of the second song

The cost of 4 devices bought on Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80.
The total cost is $40 + $80 = $120.

The selling price of each device is twice the cost, so the selling price of each device is 2 * $20 = $40.
The total selling price of 6 devices is 6 * $40 = $240.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost, which is $240 - $120 = $120.

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total energy demand of 2300 people.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the total energy demand of 2300 people as follows:

2300 people * 20% = 2300 * 0.2 = 460 bottles

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles they need to produce to meet the total demand.

460 bottles (total demand) - 4200 (current production) = -1740 bottles

However, since we cannot produce a negative number of bottles, we need to recalculate the total demand in terms of the number of bottles Hortex can produce.

Let's assume x is the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand. We can set up the equation:

x = 2300 * 0.2

x = 460

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles they need to produce to meet the total demand.

x - 4200 = 460 - 4200 = -3740

Again, we cannot produce a negative number of bottles. This means that Hortex cannot meet the total demand of 2300 people with their current production capacity.

However, if we assume that Hortex can produce more bottles than their current capacity, we can recalculate the number of bottles they need to produce.

Let's assume Hortex can produce y bottles per day. We can set up the equation:

y = 2300 * 0.2

y = 460

Since Hortex can produce y bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles they need to produce to meet the total demand.

y - 4200 = 460 - 4200 = -3740

Again, we cannot produce a negative number of bottles. This means that Hortex cannot meet the total demand of 2300 people with their current production capacity.

However, if we assume that Hortex can produce more bottles than their current capacity, we can recalculate the number of bottles they need to produce.

Let's assume Hortex can produce y bottles per day. We can set up the equation:

y = 2300 * 0.2

y = 460

Since Hortex can produce y bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles they need to produce to meet the total demand.

y - 4200 = 460 - 4200 = -3740

However, we can see that Hortex can produce more bottles than their current capacity. To meet the total demand, they need to produce at least 460 bottles more than their current capacity.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, they need to produce:

4200 + 460 = 4660 bottles per day to meet the total demand.

The number of additional bottles Hortex needs to produce is:

4660 - 4200 = 460

The final answer is: 460"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of babies wearing purple and blue, and then find the number of babies wearing both purple and a bow.

Let's assume there are 8 babies in total (since it's an octuplet). 

3/4 of the babies are dressed in purple, so the number of purple-wearers is 3/4 * 8 = 6.

1/4 of the babies are dressed in blue, so the number of blue-wearers is 1/4 * 8 = 2.

Now, 1/3 of the purple-wearers also wear bows, so the number of purple-wearers with bows is 1/3 * 6 = 2.

Since there are 2 blue-wearers, and none of them wear bows (as they are only wearing blue), the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (purple-wearers with bows) + 0 (blue-wearers with bows) = 2.

To find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we divide the number of purple-wearers with bows by the total number of babies wearing bows, and multiply by 100.

Probability = (2 / 2) * 100 = 100%

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 5 * 2 = 10 eggs.
Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by each person: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To find the total number of apartments, we first need to calculate the combined number of apartments in the first two complexes. 

200 apartments * 2 = 400 apartments

The last complex is 60% bigger than the combined number of the first two complexes. 

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. 

So, the last complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we can calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from. 

400 (from the first two complexes) + 640 (from the last complex) = 1040 apartments

Since John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, he collects garbage 3 * 1040 = 3120 times a week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * 0.40 = $1248.

The final answer is: $1248"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. A 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
2. A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, so it produces 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
3. A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, so it produces 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
4. An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one, so it produces 10 * 50 - 200 = 300 fruits.
5. A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits.
6. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, so it produces 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced by the tree during its 10 years of life:
50 + 150 + 350 + 300 + 0 + 1000 = 1650

The total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 1650."
"To find out how many dollars Jack has now, we need to calculate 1/5 of Sophia's $100 and add it to Jack's initial $100.

1/5 of $100 is $20. 

$100 (initial amount) + $20 (amount from Sophia) = $120

Jack now has $120."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R. 

We are given the following information:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: R = 4B
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: B = Y - 7
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: R + B + Y = 37

We can substitute the first two equations into the third equation to solve for Y:
4B + B + Y = 37
5B + Y = 37

Now, we can substitute B = Y - 7 into the equation:
5(Y - 7) + Y = 37
5Y - 35 + Y = 37
6Y - 35 = 37
6Y = 72
Y = 12

Now that we know Y, we can find B:
B = Y - 7
B = 12 - 7
B = 5

Now that we know B, we can find R:
R = 4B
R = 4 * 5
R = 20

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Rissa was given initially. 

Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. Let's say she gave x dollars to her sister. Then, the amount left with Rissa is 15 - x.

We know that the amount left with Rissa is 4/5 of her initial amount, so we can set up the equation:

15 - x = (4/5) * 15

Simplifying the equation, we get:

15 - x = 12

x = 3

So, Rissa gave $3 to her sister. Now, we know that Rissa was left with 15 - 3 = $12.

Since Rissa gave an equal amount of money to her sister, Ronnie also gave $3 to his sister.

Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Ronnie was given $5, and he gave $3 to his sister, so he has:

5 - 3 = $2

The final answer is 2."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know that half the mural is yellow, so the other half must be the remaining three colors. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can divide the remaining half by 3 to find the amount of each color. 

12 pints / 2 = 6 pints for the remaining half of the mural. 
6 pints / 3 = 2 pints for each of the colors red, white, and purple.

Since we are asked to find the amount of red paint used, the answer is 2 pints.

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of each room and then add them together.

First, we find the area of one bedroom: 
Area = length * width
Area = 20 * 12
Area = 240 square feet

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:
Total area of bedrooms = 4 * 240
Total area of bedrooms = 960 square feet

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is:
Area of living room = 5 * 240
Area of living room = 1200 square feet

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, we add the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house to find the total area:
Total area = Total area of bedrooms + Area of living room + Area of the rest of the house
Total area = 960 + 1200 + 1000
Total area = 3160 square feet

The total area of the house is 3160 square feet."
"To find the total number of clouds Alice counted, we need to calculate the number of clouds for each day and add them together.

On Monday, she counted 3 clouds.

On Tuesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Monday, which is 2 * 3 = 6 clouds.

On Wednesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.

On Thursday, she counted double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.

On Friday, she counted double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add the number of clouds from each day: 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93 clouds.

The total number of clouds Alice counted in the sky at lunch across all five days is 93."
"To find the number of cycles, we first need to determine the cost of the new box. Since the price remains the same, and the new box has 20% more pods, we can calculate the cost per pod in the new box.

The original box has 100 pods and costs $12. So, the cost per pod is $12 / 100 = $0.12 per pod.

The new box has 20% more pods, which means it has 100 + (100 * 0.20) = 120 pods.

The cost per pod in the new box remains the same, $0.12. To find the total cost of the new box, we multiply the cost per pod by the number of pods: $0.12 * 120 = $14.40.

Now, we need to find out how many cycles we can run for $1. To do this, we divide $1 by the cost per pod in the new box: $1 / $0.12 = 8.33 cycles.

So, you can run approximately 8 cycles with the new box for $1.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Thomas initially withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the number of bills he has is $1000 / $20 = 50 bills.

He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he is left with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

Thomas then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 bills is 40 / 2 = 20 bills. So, he is left with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

After that, he triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling his money means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 * $5 = 300 5 dollar bills.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Since team B scored 2 goals in the first half, team B scored 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half. Therefore, team A scores 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals in the second half.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much chalk the teacher has left after Monday. 

The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk and used 45% of it on Monday. To find the amount of chalk used, we multiply 5 inches by 0.45. 

5 * 0.45 = 2.25 inches

Since the teacher can't write with less than 2 inches, he recycled the remaining chalk. So, he has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches left.

Now, the teacher will use 20% of the chalk each day. To find out how many days it will take for the chalk to be less than 2 inches, we can divide 2.75 by 0.20.

2.75 / 0.20 = 13.75

Since the teacher can't use a fraction of a day, we round down to 13 days. However, this is the number of days it will take for the chalk to be completely used up at the rate of 20% per day. 

The teacher will have to recycle the chalk on the 14th day."
"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to calculate the number of students on varsity. 

One-third of the girls are on varsity, so the number of girls on varsity is 12 * (1/3) = 4.

One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so the number of boys on varsity is 12 * (1/4) = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 (boys) + 12 (girls) = 24.

The number of students not on varsity is 24 (total students) - 7 (students on varsity) = 17.

Mike bought 5 face masks. 

Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike.

"To find the total number of teeth fixed, we need to add the number of teeth drilled and capped. 

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more than that, so the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

Total teeth fixed = 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we divide the total number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth James has and multiply by 100.

Percentage of teeth fixed = (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

"To calculate the amount of milk that Mr. Marcellus returned, we need to find 2/5 of 4000 gallons.

2/5 of 4000 gallons = (2/5) * 4000 = (2 * 4000) / 5 = 8000 / 5 = 1600 gallons

Since Mr. Marcellus returned 1600 gallons of milk, we need to calculate the total refund amount.

The cost of milk per gallon is $3.5. 

Refund amount = 1600 gallons * $3.5 per gallon = $5600

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be expressed as:

W = 5(C + 7)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

W = 5C + 35

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be expressed as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Substituting the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

C = 20

So, Colin's current age is 20.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to first determine the total number of books he can buy with $27,000. 

Since Bob can buy 100 books for $500, we can find the cost per book by dividing $500 by 100 books. 

Cost per book = $500 / 100 books = $5 per book

Now, we can find the total number of books Bob can buy with $27,000 by dividing $27,000 by the cost per book.

Total number of books = $27,000 / $5 per book = 5,400 books

Since Bob is distributing the books between 3 schools, we can divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books he can buy per school.

Number of books per school = 5,400 books / 3 schools = 1,800 books per school

The final answer is: 1,800"

"To find the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to divide the total weight of coal (850 kg) by the weight of each bag (50 kg) to determine the number of bags. 

850 kg / 50 kg per bag = 17 bags

Now, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag ($18) to find the total cost.

17 bags * $18 per bag = $306

The total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To determine the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza is consumed.

For the cheese pizza, 6 friends eat 6 slices each, so the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed is 6 friends * 6 slices = 36 slices.

For the pepperoni pizza, 6 friends eat 4 slices each, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed is 6 friends * 4 slices = 24 slices.

Since the cheese pizza has 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, we can divide the total number of slices consumed by the number of slices per pizza to determine the number of each type of pizza needed.

For cheese pizza: 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas
For pepperoni pizza: 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas

Since Kate needs 3 of each type of pizza, she needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

3 (cheese pizzas) + 3 (pepperoni pizzas) = 6 pizzas

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net rate at which Jay builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in 1 hour, so his rate of building snowballs is 20 snowballs per hour. 

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. To find the rate at which they melt, we need to convert 15 minutes to hours. 15 minutes is 0.25 hours. 

So, 2 snowballs melt every 0.25 hours. 

Now, we can calculate the rate at which snowballs melt per hour: 2 snowballs / 0.25 hours = 8 snowballs per hour.

The net rate at which Jay builds snowballs is 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs per hour.

To find the time it takes for Jay to have 60 snowballs, we can divide 60 by the net rate of 12 snowballs per hour: 60 / 12 = 5 hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

We know that John is 28 now and that he was twice as old as Jim when Digimon was released. 

Let's denote Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release as 'x'. Since John was twice as old as Jim, we can express John's age at the time of Digimon's release as 2x.

We also know that the time difference between now and the time of Digimon's release is the same for both John and Jim. 

Since John is 28 now, we can set up the equation: 28 - 2x = x.

Solving for x, we get: 
28 = 3x
x = 28 / 3
x = 9.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a year, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this context, it's more logical to consider the time of release as a specific year, not a fraction of a year. 

So, we'll keep x as 9.33 years.

Now, to find Jim's current age, we add the time difference (9.33 years) to Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release (9.33 years). 

Jim's current age = 9.33 + 9.33
Jim's current age = 18.66

However, since we can't have a fraction of a year in this context, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. 

Jim's current age = 18"

The total number of slices eaten is 6."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the total number of bandages at the end of the first day is x - 38 + 50 = x + 12.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the second day is (x + 12) - 28 = x - 16.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages, so they had x - 16 + 100 = x + 84 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the third day is (x + 84) - 25 = x + 59.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so we can set up the equation x + 59 = 78.

Solving for x, we get x = 19.

The initial number of bandages on the first day was 19."

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he did on the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had and then subtract the colors she used or lost.

Amy had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 colors.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 colors.

In total, Amy initially had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister steals one palette, which has 4 colors, so Amy loses 4 colors. 

Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which has 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she uses up 3 colors.

Now, let's subtract the colors she lost and used: 26 - 4 - 3 = 19.

Amy has 19 eyeshadow colors left.

"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to calculate the height of the first floor and then subtract the height of the second floor from it.

The height of the house is 7 times Mattison's height, which is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The height of the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison's height, which is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Since the height of the house is the sum of the heights of the first and second floors, we can set up an equation: 
Height of house = Height of first floor + Height of second floor
420 = 180 + Height of second floor

To find the height of the second floor, we subtract 180 from both sides of the equation:
Height of second floor = 420 - 180
Height of second floor = 240 inches

Now, to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we subtract the height of the second floor from the height of the house:
Height of roof from second floor = Height of house - Height of second floor
Height of roof from second floor = 420 - 240
Height of roof from second floor = 180 inches

The final answer is: 180"
"To find the number of shells team Gogetters found, we first need to calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas and team The finders.

Team Alphas found 40% of 700 shells, which is 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

The remaining shells after team Alphas found their share are 700 - 280 = 420 shells.

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells, which is 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Now, to find the number of shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the number of shells found by team Alphas and team The finders from the total number of shells.

Number of shells found by team Gogetters = 700 - 280 - 252 = 168.

The final answer is: 168"
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we need to first calculate the total miles walked by the first three dogs. 

The first dog walks 1 mile, the second dog walks 4 miles, and the third dog walks 3 miles. 

Total miles walked by the first three dogs = 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

Since there are 4 dogs in total, and the average miles walked per day is 3 miles, we can calculate the total miles walked by all four dogs as follows:

Total miles walked by all four dogs = Average miles per dog * Number of dogs
Total miles walked by all four dogs = 3 * 4
Total miles walked by all four dogs = 12 miles

Now, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all four dogs to find out how many miles the last dog needs:

Miles needed by the last dog = Total miles walked by all four dogs - Total miles walked by the first three dogs
Miles needed by the last dog = 12 - 8
Miles needed by the last dog = 4 miles

The last dog needs 4 miles of exercise per day."
"To find out how much money John had leftover after paying off his debts, we need to calculate the amount of the loan he received, the amount he used to pay off his debts, and then subtract the latter from the former.

First, we calculate the amount of the loan: 
Loan amount = 40% of $250,000
= 0.4 * $250,000
= $100,000

Next, we calculate the amount he used to pay off his debts:
Amount used to pay off debts = 60% of $100,000
= 0.6 * $100,000
= $60,000

Now, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the loan amount to find out how much money he had leftover:
Amount leftover = Loan amount - Amount used to pay off debts
= $100,000 - $60,000
= $40,000

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To find the total weight of the tunas caught, we need to add the weights of all three tunas: 
56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg.

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram to find the total earnings:
128 kg * $0.50/kg = $64.

The final answer is 64."
"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first calculate the selling price of the magazines. 

The selling price is 11/8 times the cost price. 

Cost price = $72
Selling price = (11/8) * 72
Selling price = 11 * 9
Selling price = 99

Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

The final answer is 27."
"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed at the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed at the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total amount of water removed at the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, we add the total amount of water removed at each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters."
"To find out how many balloons were thrown, we need to subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons. 

First, we calculate the total number of balloons: 10 packs * 30 balloons per pack = 300 balloons.

Then, we subtract the number of balloons left: 300 - 12 = 288.

So, Jolene and her friends threw 288 balloons."
"To find the total amount of medicine in one dose, we need to calculate the amount of the second medicine. Since Saanvi had to combine 14 mL of the first medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine, the amount of the second medicine is 3 * 14 mL = 42 mL.

Now, to find the total amount of medicine in one dose, we add the amount of the first medicine (14 mL) to the amount of the second medicine (42 mL): 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL.

To find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we multiply the amount of medicine in one dose by 8: 56 mL * 8 = 448 mL.

"To find the capacity of John's school, we need to calculate 1/8 of Ali's class capacity and then multiply it by 2 since John has two classes.

1/8 of Ali's class capacity = 120 * 1/8 = 15
Since John has two classes, the combined capacity of his school = 15 * 2 = 30

The combined capacity of both schools = Ali's school capacity + John's school capacity
= 120 + 30

"To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to calculate the interest first. 

The interest is 2% of the initial amount borrowed, which is $300. 

Interest = 2% of $300 = 0.02 * $300 = $6

The total amount Stephen will pay in the first 11 months is $25 per month. 

Total amount paid in 11 months = $25 * 11 = $275

Now, we need to add the interest to the total amount paid in 11 months to find out the total amount to be paid in the twelfth month.

Total amount to be paid in the twelfth month = $275 + $6 = $281

The final answer is: $281"
"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we need to calculate the total number of diapers changed by both Jordan and his wife.

Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and there are 2 children, the total number of diapers changed per day is 5 * 2 = 10.

Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so she changes 10 / 2 = 5 diapers per day.

Since Jordan is also changing diapers, we need to subtract the number of diapers his wife changes from the total to find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day. 

10 (total diapers changed) - 5 (diapers changed by wife) = 5 diapers changed by Jordan per day.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total volume of the jar and then determine the total number of jelly beans it can hold. 

The volume of the jar is calculated as the area of the base times the height. The base is a square with sides of 6 inches, so the area of the base is 6 * 6 = 36 square inches. The height is 15 inches, so the volume of the jar is 36 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, the actual volume of the jar that can be filled with jelly beans is 540 * 0.8 = 432 cubic inches.

Since a jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar is 432 / 0.15 = 2880.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the number of red jelly beans is 2880 * 0.3 = 864.

The true number of red jelly beans is 900, so Tim's guess was 900 - 864 = 36 jelly beans off.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people on the bus after each stop.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, so the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first stop, 3/4 of 40 is 30. So, 30 people entered at the second stop. The total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the remaining spaces, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits, we need to calculate the cost of her visits for the first 5 years and the next 3 years separately.

Initially, the cost of one visit was $2. After a 150% increase, the new cost of one visit is $2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5.

For the first 5 years, Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year, so the total cost for the first 5 years is 3 * $2 = $6 per year. For 5 years, the total cost is $6 * 5 = $30.

For the next 3 years, Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year, so the total cost for the next 3 years is 3 * $5 = $15 per year. For 3 years, the total cost is $15 * 3 = $45.

The total amount Pauline spent on all visits is $30 + $45 = $75.

"To determine the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed and the time each group will take.

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

10 students per grade / 8 students per group = 1.25 groups per grade

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we'll round down to 1 group per grade. However, this would mean that some grades would not be able to participate. To accommodate all grades, we need to calculate the total number of groups needed:

- Grade 4: 10 students / 8 students per group = 1.25 groups, rounded down to 1 group
- Grade 5: 10 students / 8 students per group = 1.25 groups, rounded down to 1 group
- Grade 6: 10 students / 8 students per group = 1.25 groups, rounded down to 1 group
- Grade 7: 10 students / 8 students per group = 1.25 groups, rounded down to 1 group

There are 4 grades, and each grade can form 1 group. So, the total number of groups is 4.

Since each group takes 45 minutes, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is:

4 groups * 45 minutes per group = 180 minutes

The final answer is: 180"

"To find the length of the longer piece, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as 'x'. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

The total length of the board is 40 feet, so the sum of the lengths of the two pieces must equal 40 feet. We can write the equation as:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x = 8), we can find the length of the longer piece:

4x = 4(8) = 32

So, the longer piece is 32 feet long.

"To determine the amount of secret seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of ground beef required to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide 80 by 16 to find the total pounds of meat needed.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of meat

Since Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, we can multiply the total pounds of meat by 2 to find the total amount of seasoning needed.

5 pounds of meat * 2 tablespoons/pound = 10 tablespoons of seasoning

"To find the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the number of windows by the width of each window. 

Number of windows = 5
Width of each window = 35 inches

Total width = Number of windows * Width of each window
Total width = 5 * 35
Total width = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2.

Total fabric needed = 2 * Total width
Total fabric needed = 2 * 175
Total fabric needed = 350 inches

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute, so the total cost is 16 * $0.25 = $4.

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.2 per minute, so the total cost is 20 * $0.2 = $4.

The total cost of the 36-minute call is the sum of these two costs: $4 + $4 = $8.

"To solve this problem, we need to first express the relationship between the number of cupcakes and brownies. Let's denote the number of cupcakes as C and the number of brownies as B. We are given that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, so we can write the equation:

B = 3C - 2

We also know that the total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, and each person gets two treats. Since there are five people in the class, the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10. Therefore, we can write another equation:

C + B = 10

Now we can substitute the expression for B from the first equation into the second equation:

C + (3C - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:

4C - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:

4C = 12

Divide both sides by 4:

C = 3

So Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"To find the total cost of the manicure and pedicure with nail art, we need to calculate the cost of each service and then add the cost of the nail art.

The basic manicure costs $35, and the basic pedicure costs $40. Since Karen is getting both, we need to calculate the 20% discount on the total cost of both services.

First, calculate the total cost of both services: $35 + $40 = $75.

Next, calculate the 20% discount: 20% of $75 is 0.20 * $75 = $15.

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost: $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers (5 on each hand), the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

Finally, add the cost of the nail art to the discounted total cost: $60 + $30 = $90.

The total amount Karen would pay is $90."
"To find the total number of magazines Susan receives per year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them together.

The 3 magazines that send 12 issues each will send a total of 3 * 12 = 36 issues per year.

The 1 magazine that sends 6 issues per year will send 1 * 6 = 6 issues per year.

The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so it sends 4 * 6 = 24 issues per year.

Now, let's add the total number of issues from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

Therefore, Susan receives 66 magazines per year.

66"
"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. Let's represent the number of paintings Shelley has as 'S' and the number of paintings Kim has as 'K'. 

We know that Samantha has 27 paintings, so we can write an equation: 
S - 12 = 27

Solving for S, we get:
S = 27 + 12
S = 39

Now, we know that Shelley has 39 paintings. We also know that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. So, we can write another equation:
39 - 8 = K

Simplifying the equation, we get:
K = 31

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the earnings from both the standard rate and the reduced rate lessons.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the standard rate lessons:
4 lessons * $80 per hour = $320

Next, we need to calculate the reduced rate for the veteran lessons. Since the reduced rate is 25% less than the standard rate, we can calculate it as follows:
$80 - (25% of $80) = $80 - $20 = $60 per hour

Now, let's calculate the earnings from the reduced rate lessons:
2 lessons * $60 per hour = $120

Now, we can add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:
$320 + $120 = $440

The total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."

"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to first determine how many pomelos she had after giving some away. Since she is left with 1/4 of the original amount, we can set up the equation:

Original amount - Pomelos given away = 1/4 of the original amount

Let's represent the original amount as x. Then, the equation becomes:

x - Pomelos given away = x/4

We know that Eve had 20 pieces of pomelos originally, so we can substitute x = 20 into the equation:

20 - Pomelos given away = 20/4

To find the number of pomelos given away, we can simplify the equation:

20 - Pomelos given away = 5

Now, we can solve for Pomelos given away:

Pomelos given away = 20 - 5
Pomelos given away = 15

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

She has written 36 novels this year."
"To find the total distance covered by Michael, we need to calculate the total time he spent traveling. 

Since he is traveling at an average speed of 50 km/hr, we can calculate the total time as follows:

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 6000 km / 50 km/hr
Total time = 120 hours

Since Michael is traveling for 3 days, we can convert the total time to days:
Total time = 120 hours / 24 hours/day
Total time = 5 days

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the distance covered:
Percentage covered = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Distance covered = Speed * Time
Distance covered = 50 km/hr * 5 days * 24 hours/day
Distance covered = 6000 km

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to find the distance covered in 3 days, not the total distance. To find the correct distance covered in 3 days, we can multiply the average speed by the number of days:
Distance covered in 3 days = 50 km/hr * 3 days * 24 hours/day
Distance covered in 3 days = 3600 km

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the distance covered:
Percentage covered = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage covered = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To find the initial number of grapes, we need to work backwards from the information given.

Madeline ate 6 grapes, and her brother used 5 times as many grapes as she did, so he used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes. 

The total grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, with each pie requiring 12 grapes. So, the total grapes used by the mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

Since the total grapes used by the family is 36 (by Madeline and her brother) + 48 (by the mother) = 84 grapes.

Therefore, the initial number of grapes is 84 + 6 (the grapes eaten by Madeline) = 90 grapes.

"To find the total time spent cleaning classrooms, we need to multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom. 

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = Number of classrooms * Time spent per classroom
Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom
Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 1200 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time spent cleaning classrooms to hours:
Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 1200 minutes / 60
Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 20 hours

The custodian works 8 hours a day. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we can divide the total time spent cleaning classrooms by the total hours worked and multiply by 100:
Percentage of day spent cleaning classrooms = (Total time spent cleaning classrooms / Total hours worked) * 100
Percentage of day spent cleaning classrooms = (20 hours / 8 hours) * 100
Percentage of day spent cleaning classrooms = 2.5 * 100
Percentage of day spent cleaning classrooms = 250%

The custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning classrooms."
"To determine the number of bookcases needed, we need to calculate the total number of books each shelf can hold and then divide the total number of books by the total capacity of the shelves.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, and since each middle shelf can hold 10 books, the bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of the middle shelves: 2 middle shelves * 10 books/shelf = 20 books.

The total capacity of all the shelves is 20 (bottom) + 20 (middle) + 15 (top) = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, she needs at least 2 bookcases to hold all of them, as 110 books / 55 books/bookcase = 2 bookcases.

Next, we need to find the total number of eggs. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, and Rose bought 5 dozens, the total number of eggs is:

5 * 12 = 60 eggs

Now, we know that Rose will sell each egg for $1. So, the total revenue will be:

60 eggs * $1/egg = $60

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost

Now, 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue. To find the number of blue hats, we multiply 3/5 by the remaining hats: (3/5) * 50 = 30.

The number of white hats is the remaining hats after subtracting the blue hats: 50 - 30 = 20.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first calculate the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's on sale for $3.00 off. 

$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can divide the discounted price by the number of sticks to find the cost per stick.

$15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50 per stick

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100.

$0.50 × 100 = 50 cents

The final answer is 50."
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly in both tests.

Since she needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, we can calculate the total number of questions as follows:

Total questions = (70% of 70) + (40)
Total questions = (0.7 * 70) + 40
Total questions = 49 + 40
Total questions = 89

Now, we can calculate the number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly in the first test:

Questions correct in the first test = 60% of 70
Questions correct in the first test = 0.6 * 70
Questions correct in the first test = 42

Since she needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, we can calculate the number of questions she needs to answer correctly in the second test as follows:

Questions correct in the second test = Total questions - Questions correct in the first test
Questions correct in the second test = 89 - 42
Questions correct in the second test = 47

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 47 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as 's' and the number of blueberry cubes as 'b'. We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can write the equation:

s + b = 116

We also know that the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so we can write another equation:

b = 5s - 4

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first one:

s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6s - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6s = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

s = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting s into the second equation:

b = 5(20) - 4
b = 100 - 4
b = 96

The final answer is: 96"
"To calculate the total number of points Ara has scored, we need to multiply the number of games she has played by the points she scores per game. 

Since she has played 40 games every year for 4 years, we multiply 40 by 4 to get the total number of games played: 
40 * 4 = 160 games

Since she scores 21 points per game, we multiply the total number of games by 21 to get the total points scored:
160 * 21 = 3360

Therefore, Ara has scored a total of 3360 points in the four years."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Brendan started with 10 marbles.
2. He dropped half of them, so he lost 10 / 2 = 5 marbles.
3. He found 3 more marbles, so now he has 10 - 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.
4. He then found a bead, which is not a marble, so he got rid of it. This doesn't change the number of marbles he has.

Brendan ended up with 8 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know that for every 2 customers who come into the dealership, 1 car is sold. Since Jason needs to sell 15 cars, he needs 15 / 1 = 15 customers to come into the dealership.

Next, we know that for every 2 customers, 1 comes in. So, to get 15 customers, Jason needs 15 / 0.5 = 30 customers to come into the dealership.

Finally, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes in. To get 30 customers, Jason needs 30 / 0.04 = 750 telephone calls.

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of candles and flashlights for each room and then add them up.

There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Number of rooms with small candles = 8 / 2 = 4
Number of rooms with medium candles = 8 / 2 = 4

Total number of small candles = 4 * 4 = 16
Total number of medium candles = 4 * 5 = 20

Total number of candles = 16 + 20 = 36

There is one flashlight for each person, and there are 4 people in the house. So, the total number of flashlights = 4.

Total number of candles and flashlights = 36 (candles) + 4 (flashlights) = 40

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many chips each person gets, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of family members. 

First, we need to find the total number of chips. Since Mitchell buys two bags of chips with 55 chips each, the total number of chips is 2 * 55 = 110.

Now, we divide the total number of chips by the number of family members: 110 / 5 = 22.

So, each person gets 22 chips.

The final answer is: 22"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes to complete each side of the Rubik's cube and then add them up.

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each.
- The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time it takes to complete each side:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

Therefore, it takes John 30 minutes to complete the Rubik's cube.

"To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to first find the number of robots and footballs.

Since there are half as many robots as helmets, and there are 20 helmets, the number of robots is 20 / 2 = 10.

Since there are half as many helmets as footballs, and there are 20 helmets, the number of footballs is 20 * 2 = 40.

Now, we can find the total number of items by adding the number of robots, helmets, and footballs: 10 + 20 + 40 = 70.

The total number of items Dominick saw is 70."
"To find the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, we need to first calculate the total number of minutes he spends on calls per day. 

Since he spends 6 hours per day on calls and there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total minutes spent on calls per day is 6 * 60 = 360 minutes.

Since there are 5 days in a work week, the total minutes spent on calls in a week is 360 * 5 = 1800 minutes.

Now, we can divide the total minutes spent on calls by the time it takes to deal with a single call (15 minutes) to find the total number of calls dealt with in a week. 

Total calls = 1800 / 15 = 120 calls.

The final answer is 120."
"To find the difference in drying time, we need to calculate the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings and subtract the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

The old varnish takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting, so it would take 7 * 6 = 42 minutes to dry on 6 paintings.

The new varnish takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting, so it would take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes to dry on 6 paintings.

The difference in drying time is 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry than it would with the old varnish.

"To find the total amount of water needed, we need to calculate the water required for each group of plants and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the water needed for the 4 plants that require half a cup of water:
4 plants * 0.5 cups/plant = 2 cups

Next, let's calculate the water needed for the 8 plants that require 1 cup of water:
8 plants * 1 cup/plant = 8 cups

Now, let's calculate the water needed for the remaining plants. Since Crista has 20 plants in total, and 4 + 8 = 12 plants have been accounted for, the remaining number of plants is:
20 - 12 = 8 plants

Since these 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water, we can calculate the water needed as follows:
8 plants * 0.25 cups/plant = 2 cups

Now, let's add up the water needed for all the plants:
2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups

Therefore, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it takes Phineas to hop on land and the time it takes him to swim in the water.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance is 200 yards. Therefore, the distance on land is 200 / 2 = 100 yards.

Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute, so the time it takes him to hop 100 yards is 100 / 20 = 5 minutes.

Phineas swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute, so the time it takes him to swim 100 yards is 100 / 10 = 10 minutes.

Since these two parts are independent, we add the time it takes to hop and the time it takes to swim to get the total time: 5 + 10 = 15 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Phineas 15 minutes to return home.

"To find the total cost, we need to determine how many boxes of popsicles Bob needs to buy. Since he needs 56 popsicle sticks and each box contains 8 sticks, we can divide 56 by 8 to find the number of boxes needed.

56 ÷ 8 = 7

Since Bob can't buy a fraction of a box, he will need to buy 7 boxes of popsicles.

Now, we can multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box to find the total cost.

7 boxes * $2.00 per box = $14.00

The total cost for Bob to build his project is $14.00."
"To find the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to calculate the cost of the main phone and the cost of the four additional phones.

The main phone costs $20.

Since each additional phone costs twice as much as the main phone, the cost of each additional phone is 2 * $20 = $40.

There are four additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is 4 * $40 = $160.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones: $20 + $160 = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in a month. Since there are approximately 30 days in June, we can multiply the number of doughnuts he sells per day by 30.

Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts per day, which is equivalent to 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.

In June, Derrick sells 120 doughnuts per day for 30 days, so the total number of doughnuts he sells is 120 * 30 = 3600 doughnuts.

Since each doughnut is sold for $2, the total amount of money Derrick makes in June is 3600 * $2 = $7200.

The final answer is: $7200"
"To find out how many days Jade needs to upload all her photos, we need to divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she uploads per day.

Alicia spends $47.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate John's new speaking speed after training and then determine how long it would take him to speak 10 pages.

First, we need to find John's new speaking speed. Since his speed is 2.5 times faster than his original speed, we multiply his original speed by 2.5.

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Now, we need to find out how many words John can speak in one minute. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we divide 60 by his new speed.

Words per minute = 60 seconds / 375 WPM = 0.16 words per second

Since each page has 450 words, we can find the total number of words in 10 pages by multiplying the number of words per page by 10.

Total words = 450 words/page * 10 pages = 4500 words

Now, we can find the time it would take John to speak 10 pages by dividing the total number of words by his words per minute.

Time = Total words / Words per minute = 4500 words / 0.16 words/second = 281.25 seconds

To convert the time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60.

Time (minutes) = 281.25 seconds / 60 = 4.69 minutes

Therefore, it would take John approximately 4.69 minutes to speak 10 pages.

The final answer is: 4.69"
"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the number of people on each day.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the number of people is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the total number of people was twice the number on the second day, so the number of people is 2 * 70 = 140.

Now, we know the number of people for the first three days. To find the total number of people for the rest of the week, we need to multiply the average number of people (60) by the number of days remaining (5).

The total number of people for the rest of the week is 60 * 5 = 300.

Now, we add the number of people for the first three days to the number of people for the rest of the week to find the total number of people Conor saw that week.

Total number of people = 50 + 70 + 140 + 300 = 460.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 460."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of kernels that popped during the entire process.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped. In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount popped, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels. 

In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increased to four times the initial rate, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped. 

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate decreased to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 80 / 2 = 40 kernels popped.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels.

A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped after Garrett took the pan off the heat. This is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

The total number of kernels that popped is 200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

Therefore, Garrett has 210 pieces of popcorn to eat."
"To determine the total number of lemons needed, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for 5 gallons of lemonade. 

Since 1 gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 1 gallon as follows:

1 gallon * 6 lemons/gallon = 6 lemons per gallon

For 5 gallons, the total number of lemons required would be:

5 gallons * 6 lemons/gallon = 30 lemons

Since Tim wants to make an extra gallon that is twice as tart, we need to calculate the number of lemons required for this extra gallon. Since it's twice as tart, it will require half the amount of juice as the other gallons. 

So, for the extra gallon, we need:

1/2 * 1 gallon * 6 lemons/gallon = 3 lemons

Now, we add the lemons required for the 5 regular gallons and the extra tart gallon:

30 lemons + 3 lemons = 33 lemons

Therefore, Tim will need 33 lemons in total.

Total daily consumption = 15 kg + 6 kg = 21 kg

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the total daily consumption by 7:
21 kg * 7 = 147 kg

The Kennel house will need 147 kg of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs, we need to calculate the total number of legs of all the animals and then divide by 2.

The 2-legged animals have 2 legs each, so 10 * 2 = 20 legs.
The 4-legged animals have 4 legs each, so 15 * 4 = 60 legs.

Now, we add the total number of legs: 20 + 60 = 80 legs.

To find the total number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2: 80 / 2 = 40.

The farm has 40 pairs of animal legs in total."
"To find the number of red blocks, we need to first determine the total number of blue and yellow blocks. 

Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, and there are 4 blue blocks, the number of yellow blocks is 2 * 4 = 8.

The total number of blue and yellow blocks is 4 + 8 = 12.

Since the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, the number of red blocks can be found by subtracting the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks: 32 - 12 = 20.

Therefore, there are 20 red blocks.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Elvis traveled. 

Since Elvis traveled west for 5 hours at 18mph, the distance he covered is 5 * 18 = 90 miles.

Then, he turned around and traveled east for 8 hours at the same speed of 18mph. The distance he covered in this part is also 8 * 18 = 144 miles.

Since he traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the net distance from his house. 

The net distance is the difference between the two distances, which is 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

So, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house.

"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial value = $9000
Depreciation = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after Year 1 = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Year 2: 
Initial value = $6300
Depreciation = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after Year 2 = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Year 3: 
Initial value = $4410
Depreciation = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after Year 3 = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The boat is worth $3528 after three years."
"To find the number of pink candies, we need to first determine the number of orange and yellow candies. 

We know there are 54 red candies. The bag has twice as many orange candies as red candies, so the number of orange candies is 2 * 54 = 108.

The bag has half as many yellow candies as red candies, so the number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, we know the total number of candies in the bag is 232. We can subtract the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from this total to find the number of pink candies.

Number of pink candies = Total candies - (Red candies + Orange candies + Yellow candies)
= 232 - (54 + 108 + 27)
= 232 - 189
= 43

The final answer is 43."
"To find the total cost of the hotel and bus travels, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel and the cost of the bus trips separately.

The cost of the hotel for 3 nights is $80 * 3 = $240.

The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel, which is 0.1 * $80 = $8.

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus trips is $8 * 7 = $56.

The total cost of the hotel and bus travels is $240 + $56 = $296.

"To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we need to first determine how many marbles Dallas had initially. 

Dallas had 21 marbles after dropping 4, so we can calculate the initial number of marbles Dallas had by adding the marbles dropped to the marbles he had left: 21 + 4 = 25.

Since Mazie gave the marbles to both Dallas and Darla, the total number of marbles given away is 52. We know Dallas initially had 25 marbles, so we can subtract this from the total number of marbles given away to find out how many marbles Darla received: 52 - 25 = 27.

Therefore, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets and the cost of the popcorns separately and then add them together.

The cost of the adult ticket is $12, and there is one adult, so the total cost for the adult ticket is $12.

The cost of the child ticket is $8, and there is one child, so the total cost for the child ticket is $8.

The cost of the popcorns is $3 each, and they bought 2, so the total cost for the popcorns is $3 * 2 = $6.

Now, we add the total cost of the tickets and the popcorns together: $12 (adult ticket) + $8 (child ticket) + $6 (popcorns) = $26.

Therefore, the family pays a total of $26.

"To find the total weight of the car and its contents, we need to add the weight of the car, the luggage, and the children.

Weight of the car = 1200 pounds
Weight of the luggage = 250 pounds
Weight of the children = 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of its weight, we can calculate the force as follows:

Force = 1% of 1600 pounds = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

Therefore, John needs to push the car with a force of 16 pounds."

Since Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart, Emma's age can be calculated by adding 16 to Mia's age. 

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now, we can find the average of their ages by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 5 children.

On the first street, 5 children join, making the total 5 + 5 = 10 children.

On the second street, each of the 10 children is joined by another child, making the total 10 + 10 = 20 children.

On the third street, each of the 20 children is joined by 2 children, making the total 20 + 20 = 40 children.

However, the original 5 children leave the group, so we need to subtract them from the total. 

40 - 5 = 35

The final answer is 35."
"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the total number of meals she has already distributed from the total number of meals she has.

Total meals distributed = 64 (Friday) + 30 (Saturday) + 48 (Sunday) = 142 meals

Total meals available = 1,360

Meals left to distribute = Total meals available - Total meals distributed
= 1,360 - 142
= 1,218

The final answer is: 1218"
"To find the total amount of money James has, we need to calculate the value of each coin and add them together.

A quarter is worth 25 cents, so 1 quarter = 25 cents.
Two nickels are worth 2 * 5 cents = 10 cents.
Seven dimes are worth 7 * 10 cents = 70 cents.

Now, let's add the values together: 25 cents + 10 cents + 70 cents = 105 cents.

The total amount of money James has is 105 cents."
"To find the total age of all the siblings, we need to determine the age of the older brother first. 

Since one brother is 12 years old and this is half the age of the older brother, we can calculate the older brother's age by multiplying 12 by 2. 

12 * 2 = 24

Now that we know the older brother is 24 years old, we can find the total age of all the siblings. 

The total age of the siblings is the sum of the ages of the brothers and the sisters. 

The total age of the brothers is 12 + 24 = 36. 
The total age of the sisters is 3 * 16 = 48.

The total age of all the siblings is 36 + 48 = 84.

84"
"To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga practice, we need to calculate the time spent each week and then multiply it by the number of weeks.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes before sleep, so she spends 30 minutes per day on meditation. 

She practices 1 hour (60 minutes) of yoga 5 days a week. 

Total time spent on meditation per week: 30 minutes * 2 (morning and evening) = 60 minutes
Total time spent on yoga per week: 60 minutes * 5 days = 300 minutes

Total time spent on meditation and yoga per week: 60 minutes + 300 minutes = 360 minutes

Since there are 4 weeks, the total time spent on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks is: 360 minutes * 4 = 1440 minutes

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 1440 minutes / 60 = 24 hours

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total square feet of fabric used, we need to calculate the total area of each type of shirt and then add them together.

The area of the small shirts is 11 shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet.
The area of the medium shirts is 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet.
The area of the large shirts is 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet.

Now, we add the areas together: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet.

The quilt will be 101 square feet."
"To find the total number of seeds, we first need to calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower. Since a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, and 1 dozen equals 12, we can calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower as follows:

3 dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 seeds

Now, we know that a large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find the number of seeds in a large sunflower, we need to calculate 50% of the seeds in a small sunflower and add it to the number of seeds in a small sunflower.

50% of 36 seeds = 0.5 * 36 = 18 seeds

Now, we add 18 seeds to the number of seeds in a small sunflower:

36 seeds + 18 seeds = 54 seeds

So, a large sunflower has 54 seeds.

To find the total number of seeds altogether, we add the number of seeds in a small sunflower and a large sunflower:

36 seeds (small sunflower) + 54 seeds (large sunflower) = 90 seeds

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many pens Sarah has, we need to first determine how many pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we can calculate Timothy's pens as follows:

Timothy's pens = 3 * George's pens
Timothy's pens = 3 * 18
Timothy's pens = 54

Now that we know Timothy has 54 pens, we can calculate how many pens Sarah has, since she has half as many pens as Timothy:

Sarah's pens = Timothy's pens / 2
Sarah's pens = 54 / 2
Sarah's pens = 27

The final answer is 27."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given.

We know Albert is 36"" tall. Since Anne is twice the size of Albert, we can calculate Anne's height as 2 * 36"" = 72"".

We also know Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, so we can calculate Jackie's height as 72"" - 2"" = 70"".

Since Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, we can calculate her height before the summer as 70"" - 3"" = 67"".

The final answer is 67""."
"To find the total amount of money the company will receive for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks and then multiply it by the selling price per bar.

Since the company produces 5000 bars in one day, in two weeks (14 days), it will produce 5000 * 14 = 70,000 bars.

The selling price per bar is $2, so the total amount of money the company will receive for selling 70,000 bars is 70,000 * $2 = $140,000.

The company will receive $140,000 for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks."
"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a buy one get one 50% off deal. This means he pays full price for the first T-shirt and 50% off for the second T-shirt. 

The original price of each T-shirt is $8. So, the first T-shirt costs $8. The second T-shirt costs 50% off, which is $8 * 0.5 = $4. 

The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. The discount is $40 * 0.4 = $16. 

The cost of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes together to find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store. 

$12 (T-shirts) + $24 (shoes) = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find out how much money Ryan has, we need to calculate his earnings from completing chores and subtract the cost of the ice cream cones.

Ryan earns $6 per week for 3 weeks, so his total earnings are 6 * 3 = $18.

The cost of the ice cream cones is 3 * $1.25 = $3.75.

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from his total earnings: $18 - $3.75 = $14.25.

To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we divide his remaining money by the cost of a single ticket: $14.25 / $6.50 = 2.19.

Since we can't buy a fraction of a ticket, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets."
"To find the total amount spent, we need to add up the costs of all the items purchased by Ellen and Lani.

Ellen's purchases: 
- Leggings: $100
- Photo frame: $5
Total spent by Ellen: $100 + $5 = $105

Lani's purchases:
- Sunglasses: $30
- Two bathrobes: 2 * $100 = $200
Total spent by Lani: $30 + $200 = $230

Total amount spent by both Ellen and Lani: $105 + $230 = $335

The final answer is: 335"
"To calculate the profit, we need to first calculate the total cost of making 10 jars of the mixture. 

The cost of passion fruit for 10 jars is 10 * 2 pounds = 20 pounds. 
The cost of jackfruit for 10 jars is 10 * 1.5 pounds = 15 pounds. 
The cost of honey for 10 jars is 10 * 2 pounds = 20 pounds. 

The total cost is 20 pounds * $6 per pound + 15 pounds * $8 per pound + 20 pounds * $10 per pound = $120 + $120 + $200 = $440.

The total revenue from selling 10 jars is 10 jars * $50 per jar = $500.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $500 - $440 = $60.

The final answer is 60."
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and then add them together.

The value of a quarter is $0.25, so 32 quarters would be 32 * $0.25 = $8.
The value of a dime is $0.10, so 95 dimes would be 95 * $0.10 = $9.50.
The value of a nickel is $0.05, so 120 nickels would be 120 * $0.05 = $6.
The value of a penny is $0.01, so 750 pennies would be 750 * $0.01 = $7.50.

Now, let's add the values of all the coins together: $8 + $9.50 + $6 + $7.50 = $31.

The total dollar amount in the jar is $31."
"To find out how much money Janet has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the amount her parents gave her.

First, let's calculate the total amount she spent:

- Ice cream: $3.50
- Movie tickets for herself and her sister: 2 * $7.50 = $15
- Bracelet: $8.50
Total amount spent: $3.50 + $15 + $8.50 = $27

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the amount her parents gave her:

$40 - $27 = $13

Janet has $13 left."
"To find out how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to calculate the number of days he is open and the total number of cars he services in that time.

Josh is open 6 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday). In 2 weeks, he is open 2 * 6 = 12 days.

Since Josh services 3 cars a day, in 12 days, he services 12 * 3 = 36 cars.

He gets paid $4 per car, so his total earnings in 2 weeks would be 36 * $4 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find out how many cookies Randy has now, we need to calculate the number of cookies he had initially, subtract the number of cookies he ate, gave away, and then add the number of cookies he baked.

Initially, Randy had 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. 

He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. So, he ate 3 cookies in total. 
- Oatmeal cookies: 9 - 1 = 8
- Chocolate chip cookies: 4 - 1 = 3
- Sugar cookies: 5 - 1 = 4

He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. 
- Oatmeal cookies: 8 - 2 = 6
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3 (unchanged)
- Sugar cookies: 4 (unchanged)

He gave 2 sugar cookies to his friends. 
- Oatmeal cookies: 6 (unchanged)
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3 (unchanged)
- Sugar cookies: 4 - 2 = 2

He baked 4 of each flavor for dinner. 
- Oatmeal cookies: 6 + 4 = 10
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3 + 4 = 7
- Sugar cookies: 2 + 4 = 6

Randy now has 10 oatmeal cookies, 7 chocolate chip cookies, and 6 sugar cookies. 

The total number of cookies Randy has now is 10 + 7 + 6 = 23."
"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the earnings from each half of the collection and add them together.

First, we need to determine how many toys each half of the collection consists of. Since Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, each half would be 12 / 2 = 6 toys.

For the first half, the buyer is willing to pay $5 per toy. So, the total earnings from this half would be 6 toys * $5 = $30.

For the second half, the buyer is willing to pay $7 per toy. So, the total earnings from this half would be 6 toys * $7 = $42.

Now, we add the earnings from both halves: $30 + $42 = $72.

Therefore, Matthew would earn $72 if he agrees to the buyer's offer.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes created by the dog and then determine how many days it takes to fill them in.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes created is:
6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

However, Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog creates 6 new holes every night. This means the net change in the number of holes per day is:
9 holes/day (filled) - 6 holes/day (created) = 3 holes/day

Since Nate fills in 3 holes per day, it will take him:
84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days to fill in all the holes.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert 28 days to weeks as follows:
28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

Therefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

Final answer: 4"
"To find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we need to first calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School. 

Since Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

Average enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * Average enrollment at Norman High School
= (3/4) * 4000
= 3000

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools:

Difference in average enrollment = Average enrollment at Norman High School - Average enrollment at Butler High School
= 4000 - 3000
= 1000

The average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 greater than the average enrollment at Butler High School."
"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Number of chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies made - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)
= 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

The Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, so Igor gathered half as many, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

We also know that Igor gathered 2 more Petri dishes than requested, so the number of Petri dishes he gathered is 14 + 2 = 16.

The total number of items Igor gathered is 8 test tubes + 16 beakers + 16 Petri dishes = 40.

However, the total number of items he placed on the lab bench is 29. This means that the number of beakers he gathered is 40 - 29 = 11.

Since Igor gathered 16 beakers, the number of beakers he lost is 16 - 11 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the total number of screws needed, we need to calculate the total number of legs and then multiply it by 2 (since each leg needs 2 screws). 

There are 4 tables, each with 4 legs, so the total number of legs is 4 x 4 = 16. 

Since each leg needs 2 screws, the total number of screws needed is 16 x 2 = 32.

James has 40 screws, so to find the number of screws left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket. 

Since there are 10 eggs in the first basket and twice as many eggs in the second basket, we can calculate the number of eggs in the second basket as 2 * 10 = 20 eggs.

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets: 10 + 20 = 30 eggs.

The total number of eggs in both baskets is 30."
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount each girl raised and then add them together.

Alexandra raised $430.
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.
Sarah raised $300.

Now, let's add the amounts raised by each girl:
$430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2080.

The total amount of money raised is $2080."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between Aaron's and Vanessa's speeds and distances. 

Let's denote Aaron's speed as A miles per minute and Vanessa's speed as V miles per minute. We know that Aaron's speed is twice Vanessa's speed, so A = 2V.

We also know that Vanessa ran 4 miles, and her speed is V miles per minute. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed. Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, her time can be represented as 4 / V.

We are given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron's speed is twice Vanessa's, his time to run 1 mile is 16 / 2 = 8 minutes. Therefore, his distance is 8 miles.

Now, we know that Vanessa ran 4 miles, and Aaron ran 8 miles. Since the total distance is 12 miles, and Vanessa ran 4 miles, we can set up a proportion to find Vanessa's speed: 4 / V = 8 / A. Since A = 2V, we can substitute A with 2V, resulting in 4 / V = 8 / 2V. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 4 / V = 4 / V. This equation is true for any value of V, so we need to use the given information about Aaron's time to find Vanessa's time.

Since Aaron's time to run 8 miles is 16 minutes, and his speed is twice Vanessa's, we can set up a proportion to find Vanessa's time: 8 / 16 = 4 / x, where x is Vanessa's time. Solving for x, we get x = 32 minutes.

Therefore, Vanessa took 32 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"To find the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we first need to calculate the total length of line required for the existing dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, the total length of line required is 200 * 3 = 600 feet.

Since the caretaker already has 6 feet of line, we subtract this from the total required length to find out how much more he needs to buy: 600 - 6 = 594 feet.

The caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To calculate the total revenue per night, we need to calculate the total cost of meals and add the cost of the wine. 

The cost of meals per night is 2 meals * $5 per meal = $10. Adding the cost of the wine, the total cost per night is $10 + $5 = $15.

Since Tom's restaurant is open 2 days a week, the total revenue per week is $15 per night * 2 nights = $30.

The final answer is 30."
"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to first calculate the total cost of all the watermelons and then determine the total selling price. 

The total cost of the watermelons is $80. 

Since the vendor sold all the watermelons at a 25% profit, we can calculate the total selling price as follows:

Total selling price = Total cost + (Total cost * Profit percentage)
Total selling price = $80 + ($80 * 0.25)
Total selling price = $80 + $20
Total selling price = $100

Now, we can find the selling price of each watermelon by dividing the total selling price by the number of watermelons:

Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons
Selling price per watermelon = $100 / 50
Selling price per watermelon = $2

The fruit vendor sold each watermelon for $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the current age of James and then find the current age of John's youngest son.

Since Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

James is twice as old as Dora, so James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John had a son when he was 19, and James is 18 years old now. This means John's youngest son is 18 - 19 = -1 year old. However, since a person cannot be -1 years old, we need to re-evaluate the information.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time each person spends peeling oranges and then determine how many oranges each can peel in an hour.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

Since they start at the same time, the difference in the number of oranges peeled will be the difference in the number of oranges each can peel in an hour. 

Ana peels 20 oranges and Jane peels 15 oranges, so Ana will peel 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator first. Mark gets the radiator for 80% off, so the cost of the radiator is 20% of the original price. 

20% of $400 is 0.2 * 400 = $80.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the labor. The mechanic charges $50 per hour, and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator. 

3 hours * $50 per hour = $150.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the radiator and the labor cost. 

$80 (radiator) + $150 (labor) = $230.

The final answer is: $230."
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of legs each type of animal has. Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs. 

Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'b'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so c + b = 20. We also know that the total number of legs is 70, so 2c + 4b = 70.

We can solve this system of equations by first isolating 'b' in the first equation: b = 20 - c.

Now, substitute 'b' in the second equation: 2c + 4(20 - c) = 70.

Expand and simplify: 2c + 80 - 4c = 70.

Combine like terms: -2c + 80 = 70.

Subtract 80 from both sides: -2c = -10.

Divide by -2: c = 5.

So, there are 5 chickens.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, we need to find the total number of slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is 7 * 8 = 56.

Now, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people, which is 4 (Henry and his 3 friends). 

56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person.

The final answer is 14."
