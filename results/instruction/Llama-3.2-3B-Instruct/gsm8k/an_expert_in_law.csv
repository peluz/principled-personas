"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first calculate the total number of eggs she lays and then subtract the eggs she consumes and bakes.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.

She bakes 4 muffins with 4 eggs each, so she uses 4 * 4 = 16 eggs for baking. However, she only has 13 eggs left, which is not enough for baking. This means she can only bake 13 / 4 = 3.25 muffins, but since you can't bake a fraction of a muffin, we'll assume she bakes 3 muffins.

Now, she has 13 - 3 = 10 eggs left. She sells these 10 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each.

So, Janet makes 10 * $2 = $20 every day at the farmers' market.

"To find the total number of bolts required, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fiber separately and then add them together.

The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 
It takes half that much white fiber, which is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt.

The total number of bolts required is 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

"To calculate Josh's profit, we need to first determine the original value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%, so the new value is 150% of $80,000 plus the original value.

150% of $80,000 is 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000. 

The new value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Josh spent $50,000 on repairs, so his profit is $200,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $70,000.

The final answer is: $70,000"
"To find the total number of meters James runs per week, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week.

Since James runs 3 sprints per session, and he does this 3 times a week, we can calculate the total number of sprints per week as follows:

3 sprints/session * 3 sessions/week = 9 sprints/week

Since each sprint is 60 meters, we can multiply the total number of sprints per week by the distance per sprint:

9 sprints/week * 60 meters/sprint = 540 meters/week

Therefore, James runs a total of 540 meters per week."
"To determine the total amount of feed Wendi needs for her chickens, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she has given so far. 

In the morning, she gave 15 cups of feed to her chickens. 
In the afternoon, she gave 25 cups of feed to her chickens.

Total feed given so far = 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups

Since Wendi has 20 chickens, and each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed needed for the entire flock is 20 chickens * 3 cups = 60 cups.

To find out how much feed Wendi needs for the final meal, we subtract the total amount of feed given so far from the total amount needed for the entire flock.

Feed needed for the final meal = Total feed needed - Total feed given so far
Feed needed for the final meal = 60 cups - 40 cups
Feed needed for the final meal = 20 cups

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The cost of the first glass is $5.

The cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

The cost of 15 glasses is 15 * $3 = $45.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses: $5 + $45 = $50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many sheep Charleston has. Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Next, we need to find out how many sheep Toulouse has. Since Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, and Charleston has 80 sheep, Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we can add up the number of sheep each city has to find the total number of sheep. Toulouse has 160 sheep, Charleston has 80 sheep, and Seattle has 20 sheep. So, the total number of sheep is 160 + 80 + 20 = 260.

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where Carla downloads 60% of the file, and the second part where she downloads the remaining 40% of the file.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download 60% of the file:

60% of 200 GB = 0.6 * 200 GB = 120 GB
Time to download 120 GB = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

However, this is not the total time, as the download is interrupted by a 20-minute restart. So, the actual time spent downloading 60% of the file is 60 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to download the remaining 40% of the file:

40% of 200 GB = 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB
Time to download 80 GB = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

The total time it takes to download the entire file is the sum of the time spent downloading the first 60% and the time spent downloading the remaining 40%:

Total time = 80 minutes + 40 minutes = 120 minutes

Therefore, it takes Carla 120 minutes to download the 200 GB file.

"To find the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

Then, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move. 

Next, he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.

Finally, he drives for 2 hours at 80 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 2 = 160 miles.

The total distance John has traveled is 180 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles.

Since he started 180 miles away from home and traveled 355 miles, he is 355 - 180 = 175 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings would be:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours (45 - 40 = 5 hours), her earnings would be:
5 hours * $10/hour * 1.2 (overtime pay multiplier) = 5 * 10 * 1.2 = $60

Now, we add the earnings for the regular hours and the overtime hours:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which equals 54. 

Now, subtract 54 from 180 to find the downloads in the third month: 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads for each month: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 * $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 * $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year.

Initial cost of the tree: $90
Annual revenue from lemons: 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.50/year
Annual cost of maintenance: $3/year

Net profit per year: $10.50 (revenue) - $3 (cost) = $7.50/year

Since the initial cost of the tree is $90, we need to subtract this from the net profit to find the break-even point.

$7.50 (net profit) - $90 (initial cost) = -$82.50 (loss in the first year)

However, this calculation is incorrect as it assumes the tree will not produce any lemons in the first year. We need to recalculate the break-even point.

Let's calculate the net profit for each year until the tree starts producing lemons:

Year 1: $0 (no lemons)
Year 2: $7.50 (net profit)
Year 3: $7.50 + $10.50 = $18
Year 4: $18 + $7.50 = $25.50
Year 5: $25.50 + $10.50 = $36

At this point, the net profit is greater than the initial cost of the tree ($36 > $90). Therefore, it will take 5 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as 'x'. 

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners. 

Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, the total number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green and red houses is x/3 + 2.

Now, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. This means she sold (x - (x/3 + 2))/2 vacuum cleaners at the orange house.

We know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:

x - (x/3 + 2) - (x - (x/3 + 2))/2 = 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - (x/3 + 2) - (2x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - x/3 - 2 - x/3 + 1 = 5

Combine like terms:

-2x/3 - 1 = 5

Add 1 to both sides:

-2x/3 = 6

Multiply both sides by -3/2:

x = 9

So, Melanie started with 9 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students
Number of students remaining = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the merchant's best choice, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option.

For the jewelry option:
Initial cost: $5,000
Market increase: 2.5%
Potential selling price: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,250
Profit: $5,250 - $5,000 = $250

For the electronic gadgets option:
Initial cost: $8,000
Market increase: 1.2%
Potential selling price: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,160
Profit: $8,160 - $8,000 = $160

Since the profit from the jewelry option ($250) is greater than the profit from the electronic gadgets option ($160), the merchant should choose the jewelry option to maximize profit.

"To determine the distance covered by each train, we need to break down the movement into two parts: the initial westward movement and the subsequent northward movement.

Initially, both trains travel westward for 80 miles each. 

Then, they both travel northward for 150 miles each.

Since they traveled the same distance in both directions, we can simply add the distances covered in each direction to find the total distance covered by each train.

Total distance covered by each train = 80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles.

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks and then convert that to dozens.

Since Claire makes 3 eggs every morning, in one day she eats 3 eggs. 

In 4 weeks, there are 28 days. So, in 4 weeks, she eats 3 eggs/day * 28 days = 84 eggs.

Since 1 dozen = 12 eggs, we can divide 84 eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she eats in 4 weeks.

84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozen eggs

"To find the required speed for the remaining distance, we first need to calculate the total distance Marissa has already covered, which is 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles.

Since she wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we can calculate the total time she needs to spend to achieve this average. 

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 mph
Total time = 3 hours

We know Marissa has already spent 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours. 

Time left = Total time - Time already spent
Time left = 3 hours - 2 hours
Time left = 1 hour

Since she has 1 hour left to cover the remaining 6 miles, we can calculate the required speed as follows:

Required speed = Total distance / Time left
Required speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Required speed = 6 mph

The final answer is 6."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink separately, then add them together and subtract the spilled amount.

The orange drink is two-thirds water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the water from both drinks: 20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = 49/3 liters.

However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract that from the total: 49/3 - 1 = 46/3 liters.

To convert this to a decimal, we can divide the numerator by the denominator: 46/3 ≈ 15.33 liters.

The final answer is 15.33."
"To find the answer, we need to determine the age of Raymond when Samantha was 31. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we subtract 6 from Samantha's age to find Raymond's age: 31 - 6 = 25.

Now, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we subtract the son's age from Raymond's age at that time: 25 - 23 = 2.

Therefore, Raymond's son was 2 years old when Samantha was 31.

"To find the total number of DVDs sold, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to each group of customers and then add them together.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought 3 DVDs in total.
The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs in total.
The last 3 customers bought 0 DVDs each, so they bought 0 DVDs in total.

Now, let's add the DVDs sold to each group: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7.

Therefore, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"To find the total number of centimeters the candle will be shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to calculate the total number of hours it burns.

From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours.

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting:

4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the original price as 'x'. 

Since Kyle bought the book with a 25% discount, the amount he paid is 75% of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%). 

We know that the amount Kyle paid is $19.50. So, we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To find the original price 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she has already ordered.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the remaining amount she spent on pizza is $50 - $33 = $17.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, the number of boxes she ordered is $17 / $8.50 = 2.

Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items."
"To determine the total cost of ice cream for Cynthia, we need to calculate the number of cartons she buys in 60 days and then multiply that by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will go through 60 servings in 60 days. 

There are 15 servings per carton, so the number of cartons she buys in 60 days is 60 / 15 = 4.

The cost per carton is $4.00, so the total cost for 4 cartons is 4 * $4.00 = $16.00.

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to determine the total distance he traveled before his second stop and then subtract the distance he traveled after his second stop.

Henry traveled 20 miles before his first stop. 

The remaining distance after his first stop is 60 - 20 = 40 miles.

His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, so the distance he traveled after his second stop is 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

Now, we can find the distance between his first and second stops by subtracting the distance traveled after the second stop from the remaining distance after the first stop: 40 - 45 is incorrect, as it would be negative. 

The correct calculation is: 20 (distance before the first stop) + 15 (distance before the second stop) = 35 miles.

The correct answer is 35 miles."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the cost of the boots as B. We know that the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. 

Since one pair of heels costs $33, the other pair costs twice as much, which is 2 * $33 = $66. 

The total cost of the two pairs of heels is $33 + $66 = $99. 

Since the two pairs of heels cost five dollars less than the boots, we can set up the equation: B - $5 = $99. 

To find the cost of the boots, we add $5 to both sides of the equation: B = $99 + $5. 

B = $104.

The boots cost $104."
"To solve this problem, we can start by representing Darrell's and Allen's current ages as 7x and 11x, respectively, where x is a constant multiplier.

We know that their total age now is 162, so we can set up the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms:

18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age by multiplying 11x:

Allen's current age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is: 109"
"To find the average guess, we need to first calculate the number of jelly beans each person guessed.

The first person guessed 80 jelly beans.

The second person guessed 20 more than half of the first person's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than that is 40 + 20 = 60.

The third person guessed 25% more than the first person's guess. 25% of 80 is 0.25 * 80 = 20. So, 25% more than that is 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, we have the number of jelly beans guessed by each person: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add these numbers together and divide by 3 (the number of people).

80 + 60 + 100 = 240

240 / 3 = 80

The average guess is 80."
"To find the total hours spent taking care of dogs per day, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time spent on each dog per day.

"To find the number of gold coins Gretchen has, we need to first determine the number of silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'.

We know that the total number of coins is 110. Therefore, the sum of the number of silver coins and the number of gold coins is equal to 110. We can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the number of gold coins by adding 30:

Number of gold coins = x + 30
= 40 + 30

"To find the total points scored, we need to calculate the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the points scored in the second 20 minutes.

Points scored in the first 20 minutes = 4 points
Points scored in the second 20 minutes = 4 + (25% of 4)
To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25
25% of 4 = 4 * 0.25 = 1
Points scored in the second 20 minutes = 4 + 1 = 5 points

Total points scored = Points scored in the first 20 minutes + Points scored in the second 20 minutes

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of yogurts he eats in 30 days and then multiply it by the cost per yogurt.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The sale price of 4 yogurts is $5.00, so the cost of one yogurt is $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.

Now, we multiply the total number of yogurts by the cost per yogurt: 60 yogurts * $1.25 = $75.00.

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total amount of money John has after selling his Lego sets. 

He sells 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he gets is 13 * 15 = $195.

He then buys 8 video games for $20 each, which costs 8 * 20 = $160. 

After buying the video games, he has $195 - $160 = $35 left.

However, the problem states that he has $5 left, not $35. This means that the initial calculation of $195 is incorrect. 

Let's re-evaluate the situation. 

If John has $5 left after buying the video games, and he spent $160 on video games, then he must have had $5 + $160 = $165 initially.

Since he sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, the total amount of money he got from selling the Lego sets is 13 * 15 = $195. 

However, we know that he actually had $165 initially. This means that he must have sold fewer Lego sets than initially stated. 

Let's recalculate the number of Lego sets he sold. 

If he had $165 initially and spent $160 on video games, then he must have sold 165 - 160 = 5 Lego sets.

Since he initially had 13 Lego sets, he now has 13 - 5 = 8 Lego sets left.

The final answer is 8."
"To find John's average running speed, we need to first calculate the total distance he runs in a week and the total time he spends running.

Distance run per day:
- Day 1: 3 hours
- Day 2: 3/2 = 1.5 hours
- Day 3: 1.5 hours
Total distance run per week = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 miles

Since John runs 3 days a week, we can calculate his average speed as follows:
Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 6 miles / 3 hours
Average speed = 2 miles per hour

The final answer is 2."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine Dana's running and walking speeds. 

Since Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and skipping is half as fast as running, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. 

Let's assume the total time is 6 hours. So, the time spent running is 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours, and the time spent walking is 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours.

Now, we can calculate the distance traveled by running and walking. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance run = 6 miles/hour * 2 hours = 12 miles
Distance walked = 3 miles/hour * 4 hours = 12 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance run + Distance walked = 12 miles + 12 miles = 24 miles

Since Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, we can calculate Ben's iPhone age as follows: 
Ben's iPhone age = 2 * Suzy's iPhone age
Ben's iPhone age = 2 * 1
Ben's iPhone age = 2 years

Now, since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, we can calculate Brandon's iPhone age as follows:
Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * Ben's iPhone age
Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * 2
Brandon's iPhone age = 8 years

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone. 

When not holding the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet. When holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther, so 3 * 400 = 1200 feet.

Since the dragon's flames can reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet away from the dragon while holding the gemstone and still hit it with the javelin.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces initially set out.

Total number of pieces initially set out = 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces
Number of pieces remaining = 14

Number of pieces taken by the guests = Total number of pieces initially set out - Number of pieces remaining
= 40 - 14
= 26

The guests took 26 pieces of pie."
"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to calculate the total calories available for consumption. 

You have already consumed 1800 calories, so you have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left.

Since each serving has 250 calories, we can find the number of servings you can have with 200 calories by dividing 200 by 250. 

200 / 250 = 0.8 servings

Since each serving is 5 grams, we multiply 0.8 servings by 5 grams per serving to find the total grams you can eat.

0.8 * 5 = 4 grams

So, you can eat 4 grams of chips.

"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

Total revenue = Number of candles sold * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 candles * $2.00 per candle
Total revenue = $40.00

Total cost = Number of candles made * Cost per pound of wax and wicks
Since Charlie makes 10 candles per pound of wax, he needs 2 pounds of wax for 20 candles.
Total cost = 2 pounds * $10.00 per pound
Total cost = $20.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply that by the average time it takes to write an article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is 5 * (2/5) = 2 articles. 
So, on Tuesday, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles. 
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles written:
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours

The final answer is: 104"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice used. We know she used 220 Post-it notes at work and had 23 remaining. 

The total number of Post-it notes she used is the sum of the ones she had initially and the ones she used at work: 80 (initial) + 220 (used at work) = 300.

Since she had 23 remaining, the total number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased must be the difference between the total used and the ones remaining: 300 (total used) - 23 (remaining) = 277.

The final answer is: 277"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many blue ties John bought. We know that he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. 

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is 2 times the number of blue ties.
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
= 10

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie. 
Cost of each red tie = $40 + (50% of $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches and then divide it by the length of each piece.

There are 12 inches in 1 foot. So, 4 feet is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches):

48 ÷ 6 = 8

Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units, we first need to find the total number of units in the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 units, the total number of units is 15 * 8 = 120.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is 3/4 * 120 = 90.

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units: 120 - 90 = 30.

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs sold per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's calculate the number of eggs sold per week:
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens sold:
1764 eggs / 12 = 147 dozens

Now, we can multiply the number of dozens sold by the price per dozen to find the total weekly revenue:
147 dozens * $2 per dozen = $294

The final answer is: $294"
"To find the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to first find the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since he is sailing at 10 mph, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Time = 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM)
Distance = 10 mph * 3 hours = 30 miles

Now, to find the time it takes for him to get back, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

"To find out how many pounds Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he is removing. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

30 * 1/4 = 30 * 0.25 = 7.5 pounds

Since Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total, we subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight he needs to remove:

15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Now, we need to find out how many toys he needs to remove to make up for the remaining weight. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can divide the remaining weight by the weight of a single toy:

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

"To determine which day had the higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The total revenue for Thursday is:
6 truck tires * $60/truck tire = $360
4 car tires * $40/car tire = $160
Total revenue for Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and 0 truck tires. The total revenue for Friday is:
12 car tires * $40/car tire = $480
Total revenue for Friday = $480

Since $480 is greater than $520, the mechanic earned more revenue on Friday.

The difference in revenue between the two days is:
$480 - $520 = -$40

The mechanic earned $40 less on the day with higher revenue."
"To find the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we need to calculate the number of kittens from each cat and then add them together.

Patchy, the first cat, has thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie. Since Trixie has 12 kittens, Patchy has 3 * 12 = 36 kittens.

The total number of kittens from both cats is 36 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 48 kittens.

The Doubtfire family already had 7 kittens adopted from the local animal shelter. Adding these to the 48 kittens from the mother's cats, the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has is 48 + 7 = 55.

"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to first determine how many lollipops are left after Jean eats 2. 

Jean started with 30 lollipops and ate 2, so the number of lollipops left is 30 - 2 = 28.

Since Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag, we can divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to find out how many bags can be filled.

28 ÷ 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit and then divide the result by the weight of a single box.

Weight of the bridge = 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck = 3755 pounds
Weight of a single box = 15 pounds

Maximum weight available for boxes = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15 = 83

The maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83.

"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to calculate the total amount of the extra fees first. 

The 25% fee is 25% of $40.00, which is 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00. 

Adding the delivery fee of $3.00, the total extra fees become $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00.

Now, we add the total extra fees to the original bill: $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00.

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip to get the final price: $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to calculate the number of raspberries in the clusters and add the number of individual raspberries.

There are 6 clusters of 20 fruit each, so the total number of raspberries in the clusters is 6 * 20 = 120.

Adding the 67 individual raspberries, the total number of raspberries is 120 + 67 = 187.

The total number of raspberries is 187."
"To find the number of good oranges, we first need to determine the total number of oranges that are not good. 

We know that 1 orange is bad, 20% are unripe, and 2 are sour. 

First, let's calculate the number of unripe oranges: 
20% of 25 oranges = 0.20 * 25 = 5 oranges.

Now, we add the number of bad and sour oranges to the unripe oranges: 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges that are not good.

To find the number of good oranges, we subtract the number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges: 
25 (total) - 8 (not good) = 17 oranges.

Therefore, there are 17 good oranges in the basket.

"To find the total amount Janet paid, we need to calculate the cost of the material, the cost of construction, and the insurance.

The cost of the material is $500.
The cost of construction is $800.
The insurance cost is 10% of the total cost of the material and construction, which is 10% of ($500 + $800) = 10% of $1300 = 0.10 * $1300 = $130.

Now, we add the costs together: $500 (material) + $800 (construction) + $130 (insurance) = $1430.

"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to break down her pension into two parts: the initial 20 years of full pension and the remaining 10 years of partial pension.

For the first 20 years, her annual pension is $50,000. 

For the remaining 10 years, her annual pension increases by 5% each year. 

We can calculate the annual pension for the remaining 10 years as follows:

Year 21: $50,000 * 1.05 = $52,500
Year 22: $52,500 * 1.05 = $55,125
Year 23: $55,125 * 1.05 = $58,131.25
Year 24: $58,131.25 * 1.05 = $61,240.81
Year 25: $61,240.81 * 1.05 = $64,453.08
Year 26: $64,453.08 * 1.05 = $67,750.34
Year 27: $67,750.34 * 1.05 = $71,157.85
Year 28: $71,157.85 * 1.05 = $74,659.31
Year 29: $74,659.31 * 1.05 = $78,261.93
Year 30: $78,261.93 * 1.05 = $82,000.00

The total annual pension after 30 years is the sum of the annual pension for the first 20 years and the annual pension for the remaining 10 years.

Total annual pension = $50,000 + $82,000 = $132,000

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break down the payment into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid $140 per month. Since there are 6 months in a half year, the total amount paid for the first half of the year is:

$140 * 6 = $840

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charged her 10% less money. To calculate this, we need to find 10% of $140 and subtract it from $140:

10% of $140 = 0.1 * $140 = $14

So, the amount charged for the second half of the year is:

$140 - $14 = $126

Since there are 6 months in the second half of the year, the total amount paid for the second half of the year is:

$126 * 6 = $756

Now, we add the total amount paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year to get the total amount paid for the entire year:

$840 + $756 = $1596

Therefore, Aleena paid a total of $1596 for the streaming service by the end of the year.

"To determine how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate the total capacity of her tank and the amount of gas she has already used.

The owner's manual states that her tank holds 12 gallons of gas. Since she has already used 4 gallons to fill it up, we need to subtract that from the total capacity to find out how much gas is left in the tank.

12 gallons (total capacity) - 4 gallons (used) = 8 gallons (remaining gas)

Now, we need to find out how many miles she can drive on 8 gallons of gas. We know that she has already traveled 100 miles since the last fill-up. To find the miles per gallon (mpg), we can divide the distance traveled by the amount of gas used:

100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know her car gets 25 miles per gallon, we can multiply this by the amount of gas left in the tank to find out how far she can drive on a single tank:

8 gallons * 25 miles per gallon = 200 miles

Therefore, Sophia can drive 200 miles on a single tank of gas.

"To find the total hours spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the hours spent each week and then multiply it by 4.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV each time. He reads for half of that time, which is 1 hour. 

So, the total hours spent on TV and reading each time is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent each week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

In 4 weeks, the total hours spent on TV and reading is 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

"To find the total number of people sent by the schools, we need to calculate the number of players and coaches separately and then add them together.

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players. So, the total number of players from each school is 2 teams * 5 players/team = 10 players.

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of players is 10 players/school * 4 schools = 40 players.

Each school has 1 coach for each team, so each school has 2 coaches. The total number of coaches is 2 coaches/school * 4 schools = 8 coaches.

Adding the total number of players and coaches, we get 40 players + 8 coaches = 48 people.

"To find the total number of gems, we need to calculate the number of each type of gemstone.

Let's start with the diamonds. We know there are 175 diamonds.

The number of rubies is 35 fewer than diamonds, so the number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140.

The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so the number of emeralds is 2 * 140 = 280.

Now, we add up the number of each type of gemstone to find the total number of gems: 175 (diamonds) + 140 (rubies) + 280 (emeralds) = 595.

The total number of gems in the chest is 595."

"To calculate the total amount Shiela will pay each month, we need to first calculate the total cost of the cell phones and then add the interest.

The total cost of the cell phones is 5 units * $150 per unit = $750.

Since the interest is 2% per unit, the interest for each unit is 2% of $150, which is $3.

The total interest for 5 units is 5 * $3 = $15.

The total amount Shiela will pay each month is the cost of the cell phones plus the interest, which is $750 + $15 = $765.

"To determine the number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food she will use in the first year.

In the first 180 days, she feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, in 180 days, she will use 180 cups of dog food.

After the first 180 days, she feeds the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day. Since there are 365 days in a year, she will use 2 cups/day * 185 days (365 - 180) = 370 cups of dog food.

Total dog food used in the first year = 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags used in the first year is 550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much laundry each person does. 

Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, and Sarah does 400 pounds, we can set up an equation to find out how much laundry David does. 

Let's denote the amount of laundry David does as 'x'. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can write the equation as 4x = 400. 

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 4, which gives us x = 400 / 4 = 100. 

So, David does 100 pounds of laundry. 

Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we can calculate the amount of laundry Raymond does by dividing Sarah's laundry by 2. This gives us 400 / 2 = 200 pounds. 

Now, we can find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do by subtracting David's laundry from Raymond's laundry: 200 - 100 = 100 pounds.

Total number of thorns: 75 * 8 = 600

The total number of thorns is 600."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic equation. Let's denote the number of games lost as 'x'. Since the team won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won can be represented as 'x + 8'. 

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so the sum of the games won and lost is equal to 22. This can be written as:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by adding 8:

x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

Therefore, the football team won 15 games.

"To determine the total number of quilt blocks Gene has, we need to calculate the number of blocks from each year of his vacations. 

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old and now he is 34. This means he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since he goes on four vacations a year, the number of blocks from each year of his vacations is 4. 

To find the total number of blocks, we multiply the number of years he has been vacationing by the number of blocks per year: 11 years * 4 blocks/year = 44 blocks.

The final answer is: 44"
"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the duration of each ring and add them together.

The first time, the alarm rang for 4 times. 

The second time, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang for 4 * 3 = 12 times.

The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang for 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, we add the number of times the alarm rang in each instance: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The alarm rang a total of 22 times."
"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate the increase in her salary for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial salary = $600
Increase = 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 1 year = $600 + $60 = $660

Year 2:
Initial salary = $660
Increase = 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 2 years = $660 + $66 = $726

Year 3:
Initial salary = $726
Increase = 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Salary after 3 years = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Year 4:
Initial salary = $798.60
Increase = 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Salary after 4 years = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

Year 5:
Initial salary = $878.46
Increase = 10% of $878.46 = 0.1 * $878.46 = $87.846
Salary after 5 years = $878.46 + $87.846 = $966.306

Year 6:
Initial salary = $966.306
Increase = 10% of $966.306 = 0.1 * $966.306 = $96.6306
Salary after 6 years = $966.306 + $96.6306 = $1062.9366

Year 7:
Initial salary = $1062.9366
Increase = 10% of $1062.9366 = 0.1 * $1062.9366 = $106.29366
Salary after 7 years = $1062.9366 + $106.29366 = $1169.23

"To find out how many copies Harald sold, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as 'x'. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, we can represent the number of copies Marilyn sold as 10x.

The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Marilyn and Harald, which is 88,000. So, we can write the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 8,000

Therefore, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

"To determine the number of gift bags needed, we first need to calculate the number of guests who will attend. Since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, we can calculate the number of guests who will attend as follows:

Number of guests who will attend = Total number of invited guests - Number of guests who don't show up
= 16 - (1/4 * 16)
= 16 - 4
= 12

Now, we can calculate the total number of gift bags needed:

Number of gift bags needed = Number of guests who will attend
= 12

Since each gift bag costs $2, the total cost can be calculated as follows:

Total cost = Number of gift bags needed * Cost per gift bag
= 12 * 2
= 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount each adult and child will eat, then add those amounts together.

Since an adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child eats half as much, a child will eat 10 / 2 = 5 lbs of potato salad.

There are 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic. So, the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults is 20 * 10 = 200 lbs.

The total amount of potato salad needed for the children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amounts for adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic.

225"
"To solve this problem, we need to start with the information about Cindy's pets. Since Cindy has four pets, and Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

Now, we can add up the number of pets each person has to find the total number of pets: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

The total number of pets the three have is 28."
"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey. This means Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

We also know that Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Lastly, we know that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. Therefore, Jackson's age can be calculated by subtracting 5 from Amy's age: 9 - 5 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how fast Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles. Since Lee used to run 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can set up an equation. Let's denote Gerald's original speed as 'x'. 

Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, Lee's speed can be represented as x + 2. We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. The time it takes to run 400 meters is the distance divided by the speed. So, we can set up the equation:

400 / (x + 2) = 38

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (x + 2):

400 = 38(x + 2)

Expanding the right side of the equation:

400 = 38x + 76

Subtracting 76 from both sides:

324 = 38x

Dividing both sides by 38:

x = 8.42

Now that we know Gerald's original speed, we can calculate his new speed after the diet improvement. Gerald's speed improved by 10%, so his new speed is 110% of his original speed:

New speed = 1.1 * 8.42
New speed = 9.22

Therefore, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in approximately 9.22 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, we can multiply the number of dogs by 2 to find the number of cats.

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
= 2 * 60
= 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we need to add the number of dogs and cats and then subtract 12.

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 60 + 120
= 180

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
= 180 - 12
= 168

Now, we can find the total number of pets in the neighborhood by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
= 60 + 120 + 168
= 348

The final answer is: 348"
"To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls in the class. 

Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 are girls. 

Total number of girls = 3/5 * 200 = 120

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
= 120 - 80
= 40

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how many hours James slept, we need to calculate 2/3 of the hours Harry slept. 

Harry slept 9 hours, so 2/3 of 9 hours is (2/3) * 9 = 6 hours.

Now, we subtract the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept to find the difference. 

9 hours (Harry's sleep) - 6 hours (James' sleep) = 3 hours.

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to first determine how many ounces of tomatoes she used. Since she lost half of the volume when cooking, the 32 ounces of sauce she made came from 32 * 2 = 64 ounces of tomatoes.

Since each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes, we can divide the total ounces of tomatoes by 16 to find out how many cans she used, and then multiply that by 3 to find the total number of tomatoes.

64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans
4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam. We know that 5 cars took an exit, so the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the total number of cars minus the number of cars that took an exit.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as x. In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through. So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is x + 20.

We are given that there were originally 30 cars on the motorway. Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

x + 20 = 25

Subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation gives us:

x = 5

Therefore, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we need to calculate the total number of plants she currently has and subtract the number of plants she will give away.

Mary currently has 18 new potted plants and 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. 

First, let's calculate the total number of plants she currently has: 
18 (new plants) + (2 * 40) (plants on the ledges) = 18 + 80 = 98

Now, let's calculate the number of plants she will give away: 
She will give 1 plant from each of the 40 window ledges, so she will give away 40 plants.

Now, let's subtract the number of plants she will give away from the total number of plants she currently has: 
98 - 40 = 58

Therefore, Mary will remain with 58 potted plants."
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of rings for each friend and add them together.

The fourth friend pressed on the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed on the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend, so the second friend pressed on the doorbell 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The first friend pressed on the doorbell 20 times.

Now, let's add the number of doorbell rings for each friend: 
60 + 70 + 25 + 20 = 175

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to calculate the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The inner dimensions of each box are:
Length = 5 inches - 2 inches (1 inch on each side) = 3 inches
Width = 6 inches - 2 inches (1 inch on each side) = 4 inches
Height = 4 inches - 2 inches (1 inch on each side) = 2 inches

The inner volume of one box is:
Volume = Length * Width * Height = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:
Total Volume = 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Frankie spent watching TV on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. 

On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1 hour each night, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours. 

The total time spent watching TV on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours. 

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday can be calculated by subtracting the time spent on the other days from the total time. 

7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes. 

1.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 90 minutes

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we can divide 90 minutes by 30 minutes to find the number of episodes. 

90 / 30 = 3

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 episodes of a 30-minute show on Wednesday."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x.

Since Henry wants to make twice as many cookies this year, he will bake 2x cookies this year.

He realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked this year is 2x + 15.

He drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has left is 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10.

We are given that the number of cookies he has left is 110. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 50

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

The cashback amount is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons:
10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

Now, subtract the cashback amount from the total cost:
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00."
"To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we need to first calculate the total number of roll-ups each of them had.

Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 roll-ups wide * 24 rolls up long = 48 roll-ups
Marcell's roll-ups: 3 roll-ups wide * 14 rolls up long = 42 roll-ups

Since they both ate their entire amount, we can add the total number of roll-ups they had: 48 + 42 = 90 roll-ups

To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups by 2: 90 / 2 = 45

The average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice is 45.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the rate at which the boat is taking on water. We know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet it rows. 

Given that it took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can calculate the rate at which she rows. 

Rate = Distance / Time = 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second.

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we can calculate the rate at which it takes on water as follows:

Rate of water intake = 2 liters / 10 feet = 0.2 liters per foot.

Now, we can calculate the total time it will take Julia to row to the shore. 

Time = Distance / Rate = 64 feet / 1.25 feet per second = 51.2 seconds.

Since Julia has already rowed for 16 seconds, the remaining time is 51.2 - 16 = 35.2 seconds.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of water the boat will take on during the remaining time.

Total water intake = Rate of water intake * Remaining time = 0.2 liters per foot * 35.2 seconds = 7.04 liters.

However, we need to account for the water that has already been taken on during the initial 16 seconds. 

Initial water intake = Rate of water intake * Initial time = 0.2 liters per foot * 16 seconds = 3.2 liters.

Total water intake = Initial water intake + Water intake during remaining time = 3.2 liters + 7.04 liters = 10.24 liters.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as B and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as D.

We are given that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, so we can write an equation: 
6B = 1800

To find the value of B, we divide both sides of the equation by 6:
B = 1800 / 6
B = 300

Now, we are given that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. We can write another equation:
B = 50D

Substituting the value of B we found earlier into this equation:
300 = 50D

To find the value of D, we divide both sides of the equation by 50:
D = 300 / 50
D = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

"To calculate Sasha's profit, we need to first calculate the total cost of the lumber and the total revenue from selling it.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $10 per board = $100.

The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $16 per board = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Now, let's calculate the selling price of each type of board. Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the new selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 + (50% of $10) = $10 + $5 = $15 per board.

The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 + (50% of $16) = $16 + $8 = $24 per board.

The total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $15 per board = $150.

The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $24 per board = $120.

The total revenue from selling all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

Sasha's profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we need to determine the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to first find the total number of vehicles already present at the port on the first day. 

There were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles on the second day is 30. To find the number of vehicles added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers added on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by 5: 20 / 5 = 4.

Therefore, 4 containers were imported on the second day."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate Adrien's and Lylah's current salaries and then add them together.

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 30% four years ago, we can calculate his current salary as follows:

Current salary = $40,000 + (30% of $40,000)
= $40,000 + 0.3 * $40,000
= $40,000 + $12,000
= $52,000

Now, we know Adrien's current salary is $52,000. Since his salary increased by 40% four years later, we can calculate his current salary as follows:

Current salary = $52,000 + (40% of $52,000)
= $52,000 + 0.4 * $52,000
= $52,000 + $20,800
= $72,800

Now that we know Adrien's current salary, we can calculate Lylah's current salary. Since Adrien's salary is 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up the following equation:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30%
$72,800 = Lylah's salary + 0.3 * Lylah's salary
$72,800 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $72,800 / 1.3
= $56,000

Now that we know both Adrien's and Lylah's current salaries, we can calculate their total salary four years later:

Total salary = Adrien's salary + Lylah's salary
= $72,800 + $56,000
= $128,800

The final answer is: $128,800"

Kael brought twice the amount of apples, which is 2 * 5 = 10 apples. He also brought half the number of oranges, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges. So, the total number of fruits Kael brought is 10 + 4 = 14.

Now, we add the total number of fruits Morisette and Kael brought together: 13 + 14 = 27.

Therefore, Morisette and Kael have 27 fruits in total.

"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate the hours she slept each day.

On Monday, she slept 8 hours.
On Tuesday, she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours.
On Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less than Tuesday, so she slept 6 - 2 = 4 hours.
On Thursday, she slept 1 hour more than Wednesday, so she slept 4 + 1 = 5 hours.
On Friday, she slept 1 hour more than Thursday, so she slept 5 + 1 = 6 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours she slept each day:
8 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 29

The total hours Sadie slept throughout the week is 29."
"To find out how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down her running time into two segments: the first 3 hours and the remaining 4 hours.

In the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour. So, she covers a distance of 3 * 10 = 30 miles.

In the remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour. So, she covers a distance of 4 * 5 = 20 miles.

To find the total distance covered in 7 hours, we add the distances covered in the two segments: 30 + 20 = 50 miles.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many letters Jennie stamped. Since she put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of letters needing stamps = 60
Number of letters stamped = (1/3) * 60 = 20

Now, we know that after stamping 20 letters, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This means that the original number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters is 30.

Since Jennie stamped 20 letters, the original number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters is 30 + 20 = 50.

Therefore, Jennie's mom had 50 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Julia bought a package of spoons, but the exact number is unknown. Let's call this number 'x'. 

Her husband also bought 5 spoons and gave them to Julia. So, the total number of spoons Julia had initially is x + 5.

Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so the number of spoons she had left after using 3 is (x + 5) - 3.

We are told that after setting the table, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. This means that the number of spoons she had left after using 3 is equal to 12. 

So, we can set up the equation: (x + 5) - 3 = 12.

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 2 = 12.

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: x = 10.

Therefore, the package that Julia bought initially contained 10 spoons.

"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages. 

First, we know Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. Since he bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, we can calculate the number of fish sausages by adding 6 to the number of chicken sausages. 

Number of fish sausages = 38 (chicken sausages) + 6 = 44

Now, we can find the total number of sausages by adding the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages.

Total sausages = 38 (chicken sausages) + 44 (fish sausages) = 82

The final answer is: 82"
"To find the total number of friends Amy and Lily have together, we need to add the number of friends each of them has.

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to first find the cost of each item.

Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs 15$, a watermelon costs 3 * 15 = 45$.

An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so an orange costs 45 - 5 = 40$.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each item:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * 45 = 180$
- 20 peppers: 20 * 15 = 300$
- 10 oranges: 10 * 40 = 400$

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is 180 + 300 + 400 = 880$."
"To calculate the profit, we need to first calculate the total time spent on patients per day and then the total revenue from both the hospital and the patients.

Total time spent on patients per day = 500 patients * 24 minutes per patient = 12,000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The hospital's total cost per hour is $150, so the total cost per day is:
200 hours * $150 per hour = $30,000

The hospital charges the patients $200 per hour, so the total revenue per hour is:
$200 per hour

The total revenue per day is:
200 hours * $200 per hour = $40,000

Now, we can calculate the profit:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
= $40,000 - $30,000
= $10,000

The hospital makes a profit of $10,000 per day."
"To find the number of elves left, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Nissa hires 60 elves.

A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. 
A third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20 elves. 
So, 20 elves quit, leaving 60 - 20 = 40 elves.

Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. 
So, 10 more elves quit, leaving 40 - 10 = 30 elves.

Therefore, there are 30 elves left.

"To find the total expenditure for the two months, we need to calculate the expenditure in May and June separately and then add them together.

Expenditure in May = $500
Expenditure in June = Expenditure in May - $60
Expenditure in June = $500 - $60
Expenditure in June = $440

Total expenditure for the two months = Expenditure in May + Expenditure in June
Total expenditure for the two months = $500 + $440
Total expenditure for the two months = $940

"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the number of tickets used for the roller coaster and the luge rides separately and then add them together.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she used 2 + 2 = 4 rides. Since each ride costs 6 tickets, Pam used 4 * 6 = 24 tickets.

Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he used 4 + 2 = 6 rides. Since each ride costs 6 tickets, Fred used 6 * 6 = 36 tickets.

In total, Pam and Fred used 24 + 36 = 60 tickets that day.

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the total miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday.

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, so he walked 6 * 4 = 24 miles.

The total miles walked from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total.

Miles walked on Monday and Tuesday = 4 + 24 = 28 miles
Miles walked on Wednesday = Total miles - Miles walked on Monday and Tuesday
= 41 - 28
= 13 miles

The final answer is 13."

Total cost per year = 720

The total cost of car washes for Tom in a year is $720."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5. 

Brian initially had 20 video games but lost 5, so he now has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Since Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship. Let's denote the number of video games Bobby has as B. 

The equation can be written as: B = 3 * 15 - 5

Now, we can solve for B: 
B = 3 * 15 - 5
B = 45 - 5
B = 40

So, Bobby has 40 video games."
"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we need to first find the total number of Scottish unicorns. 

Since one third of the unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we can calculate the number of Scottish unicorns as follows:

Total unicorns = 27
Scottish unicorns = Total unicorns / 3
Scottish unicorns = 27 / 3
Scottish unicorns = 9

Now, we know that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. 

Female Scottish unicorns = (2/3) * Scottish unicorns
Female Scottish unicorns = (2/3) * 9
Female Scottish unicorns = 6

"To calculate the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we need to calculate the cost of the items first.

The cost of 2 subs is 2 * $7.50 = $15.00
The cost of 2 bags of chips is 2 * $1.50 = $3.00
The cost of 2 cookies is 2 * $1.00 = $2.00

The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

The delivery fee is 20% of $20.00, which is 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

The total cost of the order is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

"To find out how many questions Mark completed in the first test, we multiply the rate by the time taken: 5 questions/hour * 8 hours = 40 questions.

For the second test, we do the same: 5 questions/hour * 6 hours = 30 questions.

The total number of questions completed is 40 + 30 = 70 questions.

Since the first test had 75 questions and the second test had 100 questions, the total number of questions is 75 + 100 = 175 questions.

To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we subtract the total number of questions completed from the total number of questions: 175 - 70 = 105 questions.

"To find the number of pink gumballs, we need to first calculate four times the number of blue gumballs. 

Four times the number of blue gumballs is 4 * 12 = 48.

Since there are 22 more pink gumballs than four times the number of blue gumballs, we add 22 to the result. 

48 + 22 = 70.

Therefore, there are 70 pink gumballs."
"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to first determine the total number of semi-automatic cars. 

Total number of cars = 20
Number of automatic cars = 12
Number of manual cars = 4

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Number of automatic cars + Number of manual cars)
= 20 - (12 + 4)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, we can calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
= (4 / 20) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

The percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%."
"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees. Let's denote the number of baby bees as B. Then, the number of worker bees is 2B.

We also know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens. Let's denote the number of queens as Q. Then, B = 2Q.

Since B = 2Q, we can substitute this into the equation for the number of worker bees: 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, which is the sum of worker bees, baby bees, and queens. So, we can write the equation: 2B + B + Q = 700.

Substituting B = 2Q into this equation, we get: 2(2Q) + 2Q + Q = 700.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700, which is 7Q = 700.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get: Q = 100.

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees: B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200.

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees: 2B = 2(200) = 400.

The final answer is: 400"
"To calculate the amount of money Jordan would earn in a week if he spent his video game time working, we need to first calculate the number of hours he would work in a week.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, in a week (7 days) he would play for 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

If he earns $10 an hour, then in 14 hours, he would earn 14 * $10 = $140.

Therefore, if Jordan spent his video game time working, he would earn $140 in one week."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to first find the total cost of the food items and the total cost of the non-food items. 

The total cost of the food items is 2 dollars (milk) + 3 dollars (eggs) = 5 dollars.

The total cost of the non-food items is 3 dollars (light bulbs) + 3 dollars (cups) + 4 dollars (roach traps) = 10 dollars.

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate 10% of 10 dollars, which is 1 dollar. 

The total cost of the non-food items with tax is 10 dollars + 1 dollar = 11 dollars.

The total cost of everything is the sum of the total cost of the food items and the total cost of the non-food items with tax, which is 5 dollars + 11 dollars = 16 dollars.

"To calculate Kim's profit, we need to first calculate his total expenses and total income.

Total income: Kim has 3 clients and 5 potential clients, so he has a total of 8 clients. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. Therefore, the total number of bottles of bleach needed is 8 * 2 = 16, and the total number of packs of cloths needed is 8 * 1 = 8.

The total cost of bleach is 16 * $2 = $32, and the total cost of cloths is 8 * $5 = $40. Therefore, Kim's total expenses are $32 + $40 = $72.

Now, we can calculate Kim's profit by subtracting his total expenses from his total income: $92 - $72 = $20.

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we need to calculate the number of harvests per year:
12 months/year / 3 months/harvest = 4 harvests/year

Now, we multiply the total number of pineapples per year by the number of harvests per year:
1000 pineapples/year * 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples/year

Therefore, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year.

"To find the total number of blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each box and then add them together.

The first box has 500 pieces.

The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first one, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.

The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first one, so it has 1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the number of pieces in each box: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

Therefore, Johnny picks up 2125 blocks if he picks up all the legos.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. 

In the next 6 hours, half of those bees return, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.

So, after the first 12 hours, the total number of bees that have left is 30 + 15 = 45 bees.

In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as the initial 30 leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.

Now, we need to find out how many bees that left before the last 6 hours have returned. Since 15 bees returned in the first 12 hours, and 60 bees left in the last 6 hours, the number of bees that left before the last 6 hours is 60 - 15 = 45 bees.

In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left before that (45 bees) return to the hive.

Therefore, the number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 45.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and a child ticket is $10. Since Brittany's mom bought 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, the total cost is:

$12 (adult) + $10 (child) = $22

If she received $8 in change, then the amount she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets minus the change:

$22 (total cost) - $8 (change) = $14

Therefore, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $14.

To find Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

Dorothy's friends = 12 / 3
Dorothy's friends = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' friends by multiplying Dorothy's friends by 4, since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy:

James' friends = 4 * Dorothy's friends
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

"To determine the winner and the waiting time, we need to calculate the time it takes for each person to reach home.

First, we need to convert the distances to the same units. Since the speeds are given in feet per minute, we'll convert the distances to feet. 

Steve's distance is 3 miles, which is 3 * 5280 = 15,840 feet.
Tim's distance is 2 miles, which is 2 * 5280 = 10,560 feet.

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each person to reach home:

Time = Distance / Speed

For Steve: Time = 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes

For Tim: Time = 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve is the winner. 

The waiting time for the loser (Tim) is the difference between the time it takes for the winner (Steve) to reach home and the time it takes for the loser (Tim) to reach home. 

Waiting time = Time taken by loser - Time taken by winner
Waiting time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes
Waiting time = 4 minutes

Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so before the pigeons, there were 7 + 3 = 10 fries.

The seagull ate half the amount of fries that Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries. So, before the seagull, there were 10 + 7 = 17 fries.

"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the total hours for each type of day and then add them together.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so that's 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 of these days in a week, the total hours for these days is 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 of these days in a week, the total hours for these days is 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week.

Now, we need to calculate the total hours for the entire semester. There are 16 weeks in a semester, so we multiply the weekly hours by 16:

9 hours/week * 16 weeks = 144 hours
8 hours/week * 16 weeks = 128 hours

Adding these together, we get:

"To determine the winner, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so he covers the entire length of the field (100 yards) 15 times. This means he runs 15 * 100 = 1500 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, covering 100 yards, and then runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards. She does this 34 times. So, she runs 100 + 80 = 180 yards per round, and 180 * 34 = 6120 yards.

Since 6120 yards is greater than 1500 yards, Kelly wins the contest. 

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance: 6120 - 1500 = 4620 yards.

"To find the total number of fish caught, we need to calculate the number of fish each person caught and then add them together.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
Anakin's total: 10 (starfish) + 6 (sea horses) + 3 (clownfish) = 19 fish

"To calculate the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to apply the 20% increase every two months.

Initial cost = $20
Increase after 2 months = 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4
Cost after 2 months = $20 + $4 = $24

Increase after 4 months = 20% of $24 = 0.20 * $24 = $4.80
Cost after 4 months = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80

Increase after 6 months = 20% of $28.80 = 0.20 * $28.80 = $5.76
Cost after 6 months = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56

Increase after 8 months = 20% of $34.56 = 0.20 * $34.56 = $6.91
Cost after 8 months = $34.56 + $6.91 = $41.47

Increase after 10 months = 20% of $41.47 = 0.20 * $41.47 = $8.29
Cost after 10 months = $41.47 + $8.29 = $49.76

Increase after 12 months = 20% of $49.76 = 0.20 * $49.76 = $9.95
Cost after 12 months = $49.76 + $9.95 = $59.71

Increase after 14 months = 20% of $59.71 = 0.20 * $59.71 = $11.94
Cost after 14 months = $59.71 + $11.94 = $71.65

Increase after 16 months = 20% of $71.65 = 0.20 * $71.65 = $14.33
Cost after 16 months = $71.65 + $14.33 = $85.98

Increase after 18 months = 20% of $85.98 = 0.20 * $85.98 = $17.20
Cost after 18 months = $85.98 + $17.20 = $103.18

Increase after 20 months = 20% of $103.18 = 0.20 * $103.18 = $20.64
Cost after 20 months = $103.18 + $20.64 = $123.82

Increase after 22 months = 20% of $123.82 = 0.20 * $123.82 = $24.76
Cost after 22 months = $123.82 + $24.76 = $148.58

Increase after 24 months = 20% of $148.58 = 0.20 * $148.58 = $29.72
Cost after 24 months = $148.58 + $29.72 = $178.30

Increase after 26 months = 20% of $178.30 = 0.20 * $178.30 = $35.66
Cost after 26 months = $178.30 + $35.66 = $213.96

Increase after 28 months = 20% of $213.96 = 0.20 * $213.96 = $42.79
Cost after 28 months = $213.96 + $42.79 = $256.75

Increase after 30 months = 20% of $256.75 = 0.20 * $256.75 = $51.55
Cost after 30 months = $256.75 + $51.55 = $308.30

Increase after 32 months = 20% of $308.30 = 0.20 * $308.30 = $61.66
Cost after 32 months = $308.30 + $61.66 = $369.96

"To find the total value of all the toys, we need to first determine the cost of each type of toy.

We know that one red car costs $4. Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and an action figure costs $5, the doll costs 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, we have the cost of one red car ($4) and the doll ($15). We also know there are 5 red cars. So, the total cost of the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

We also know there are 3 action figures, and each costs $5. So, the total cost of the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, we can add up the costs of all the toys: $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) + $15 (doll) = $50.

The total value of all the toys is $50.

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the income she would have earned by doing her taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the income she would have earned by doing her taxes herself. She would lose 3 hours of freelance work, which would result in a loss of $35/hour. So, the total loss would be:

3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, let's calculate the cost of hiring the accountant. The accountant charges $90.

To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the total loss:

$105 (loss) - $90 (cost) = $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer accessories she purchased.

The total cost of the accessories is the sum of the costs of the machine, scanner, CD burner, and printer.

Total cost = Cost of machine + Cost of scanner + Cost of CD burner + Cost of printer
Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102
Total cost = €1403

Now, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from Elvira's budget to find out how much money she will have left for her clothing.

Money left for clothing = Budget - Total cost
Money left for clothing = €1500 - €1403
Money left for clothing = €97

"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we need to divide the total number of eggs required for the Spanish flans by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting job.

Total eggs required for 15 flans = 15 * 3 = 45 eggs
Eggs received per babysitting job = 9 eggs

Number of babysitting jobs required = Total eggs required / Eggs received per job
= 45 / 9
= 5

Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times to have enough eggs for 15 Spanish flans.

"To solve this problem, let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can express this as S = 2B.

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This can be expressed as (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Substituting S = 2B into the equation, we get (2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Combine like terms: 3B + 4 = 28.

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3B = 24.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 8.

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into S = 2B, which gives us S = 2 * 8 = 16.

Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.

"To find the total miles walked in a week, we need to calculate the miles walked on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, Pancho walks 20 miles per day. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so he walks 5 * 20 = 100 miles on weekdays.

On weekends, Pancho walks 10 miles per day. There are 2 weekend days in a week, so he walks 2 * 10 = 20 miles on weekends.

To find the total miles walked in a week, we add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants.

The hat costs $25.

The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 * $25 = $75.

The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. The average is calculated by adding the costs and dividing by 2. 

Average cost of hat and jacket = ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50

The total cost of the uniform is the sum of the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants. 

Total cost = $25 + $75 + $50 = $150

The total cost of each uniform is $150."

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we can calculate the total age of the four birds: 
8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) + 8 (Sally Thirty-two) = 51

The total age of the four birds is 51."
"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to calculate the total monthly payment and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the total minimum payment: 
$300 (student loans) + $200 (credit card) + $500 (mortgage) = $1000

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum payment:
50% of $1000 = 0.5 * $1000 = $500

Now, we add this amount to the total minimum payment to get the new monthly payment:
$1000 (minimum) + $500 (50% more) = $1500

To find the yearly payment, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:
$1500 * 12 = $18,000

"To find the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato, then multiply that by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds
Total time to prep one potato: 1.5 minutes + 5 seconds = 1.5 minutes + 0.0833 minutes (converting 5 seconds to minutes) = 1.5833 minutes

Since there are 60 potatoes, the total time to prep all the potatoes is: 
60 potatoes * 1.5833 minutes/potato = 94.999 minutes

Converting this to just minutes: 94.999 minutes ≈ 95 minutes.

"To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to first calculate their total revenue and total cost. 

First, let's calculate their total revenue. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10. Since they made $25 in profit, their total revenue is $25 + $10 = $35.

Now, let's calculate their total cost. They spend $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar per gallon. So, the total cost per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5. 

To find out how many gallons they made, we can divide their total revenue by the revenue per gallon: $35 / $10 = 3.5 gallons.

Now, we can multiply the total cost per gallon by the number of gallons they made to find their total cost: $5 * 3.5 = $17.50.

So, they spent $17.50 on lemons.

"To find out how much money Zaid will have left, we need to calculate his expenses and donations step by step.

1. Zaid earns 6000$ per month.
2. He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 * 6000 = 1500$.
3. He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 1/3 * 6000 = 2000$.
4. The total amount spent so far is 1500 + 2000 = 3500$.
5. The remaining amount is 6000 - 3500 = 2500$.
6. He donates half of the remaining amount to charity, which is 1/2 * 2500 = 1250$.
7. The amount left after donation is 2500 - 1250 = 1250$.
8. He gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$, so the total amount spent on these gifts is 200 + 700 = 900$.
9. The amount left after these gifts is 1250 - 900 = 350$.

Therefore, Zaid will have 350$ left after all these expenses and donations.

"To find the number of votes the loser got, we need to first find the number of votes the winner got. 

Since the winner got 3/4 of the total votes, we can calculate the number of votes the winner got by multiplying the total number of votes by 3/4.

Number of votes the winner got = (3/4) * 80
= 60

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser got is the difference between the total number of votes and the number of votes the winner got.

Number of votes the loser got = Total number of votes - Number of votes the winner got

The number of votes the loser got is 20."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of red roses, white carnations, and pink calla lilies. 

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses is 4x. 

We also know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, so the number of pink calla lilies is 5x.

The total number of items ordered is the sum of red roses, white carnations, and pink calla lilies. Since Sandra has threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm, we can set up the equation:

4x + x + 5x = Total number of items ordered

However, we don't know the total number of items ordered. We can infer that the total number of items ordered is at least 200 (the number of pink calla lilies), but we don't have an exact number. 

Let's assume the total number of items ordered is at least 200. We can set up the equation as follows:

4x + x + 5x ≥ 200

Combine like terms:

10x ≥ 200

Divide both sides by 10:

x ≥ 20

Now that we know x ≥ 20, we can find the number of red roses:

Number of red roses = 4x
= 4 * 20
= 80

Therefore, Fred must deliver at least 80 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote Jean's current age as J, Mark's current age as M, and Jan's current age as A.

We are given the following information:
1. Jean is two years older than Mark: J = M + 2
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age: (M - 2) = (A/2 - 5)

We are also given that Jan is 30 years old: A = 30

Now, we can substitute A = 30 into the second equation:
(M - 2) = (30/2 - 5)
(M - 2) = 15 - 5
(M - 2) = 10
M = 12

Now that we know Mark's age, we can find Jean's age using the first equation:
J = M + 2
J = 12 + 2
J = 14

Therefore, Jean is 14 years old.

"To determine the winning time of the faster team, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team.

The faster team's time for each leg is 55 seconds. Since there are 4 legs, their total time is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner runs 60 seconds. The subsequent runners are 3 seconds faster than the previous one. So, their times are 60, 57, 54, and 51 seconds.

To find the total time for the less well-rounded team, we add up their individual times: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

Now, we compare the total times of both teams. The faster team's time is 220 seconds, and the less well-rounded team's time is 222 seconds. Therefore, the faster team wins by 222 - 220 = 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of two independent events: rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is 3/6, since there are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. This simplifies to 1/2.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2), since the events are independent. There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die (2, 4, and 6), so the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6, and the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 3/6. 

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (3/6) * (3/6) = 9/36 = 1/4.

Now, we can find the difference in probability by subtracting the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/4) * 100 = 25%.

Therefore, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

Jenna's apples = 20 / 2
Jenna's apples = 10

Now, to find the total number of apples picked by both Jenna and her mom, we add their individual shares:

Total apples = Jenna's apples + Mom's apples
Total apples = 10 + 20
Total apples = 30

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of straw pieces used for the hamsters and the rabbits. 

The hamsters have 10 cages, each with 5 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw pieces used for the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

The rabbits have 20 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw pieces used for the rabbits is 20.

The total number of straw pieces used for the hamsters and rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70.

Since the total number of straw pieces distributed among the small rodents is 160, the number of straw pieces left for the rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'x'. Then, the total number of straw pieces used for the rats is 3x * 6 = 18x.

Since the total number of straw pieces used for the rats is 90, we can set up the equation 18x = 90.

To solve for 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 18: x = 90 / 18 = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 rats in each cage."

"To find the total cost of the bags, we need to subtract the profit from the total revenue. 

Total revenue = Number of bags * Selling price per bag
Total revenue = Number of bags * $30
Total revenue = $400
Number of bags = $400 / $30
Number of bags = 13.33

Since we can't sell a fraction of a bag, we'll round down to 13 bags.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the bags, including transportation:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 13 * $20
Total cost = $260

Now, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the total transportation cost:
Total transportation cost = Total revenue - Total cost
Total transportation cost = $400 - $260
Total transportation cost = $140

Since the cost per bag for transportation is $2, we can find the number of bags transported:
Number of bags transported = Total transportation cost / Cost per bag
Number of bags transported = $140 / $2
Number of bags transported = 70

However, this is the number of bags transported, not the total number of bags. Since the trader bought the bags from the farmer, the number of bags transported should be equal to the number of bags bought. 

So, the number of bags bought is also 70. 

The trader bought 70 bags.

Total cost of all expenses = Total cost of tickets and food + Total cost of rides
Total cost of all expenses = $36.00 + $66
Total cost of all expenses = $102

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we need to divide the total cost by 3.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of trees Tom plants and chops down over 10 years, and then subtract the number of trees that die.

Tom plants 10 trees per year, so over 10 years, he plants 10 * 10 = 100 trees.

He chops down 2 trees per year, so over 10 years, he chops down 2 * 10 = 20 trees.

Initially, Tom had 50 trees. After 10 years, he has 50 + 100 - 20 = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die. To find 30% of 130, we multiply 130 by 0.3, which equals 39.

So, 39 trees die, leaving Tom with 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times that number, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards. So, now she has 20 + 60 = 80 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards. So, now she has 80 + 40 = 120 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokémon cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number is 60 + 40 = 100 cards. Twice that number is 2 * 100 = 200 cards. So, now she has 120 + 200 = 320 cards.

Therefore, Elaine now has 320 Pokémon cards.

"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we first need to determine how many sentences he edits for each publisher. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we can divide the total number of sentences by 2.

1000 sentences / 2 = 500 sentences per publisher

Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, we can calculate the amount Mark earns from Publisher A:

500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, we can calculate the amount Mark earns from Publisher B:

500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

Now, we can add the amounts Mark earns from both publishers to find his total weekly earnings:

2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

Mark makes 7500 cents in a week."
"To find the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the amount of water he gets in the morning and the amount he gets in the afternoon, then add them together.

In the morning, Baldur gets 5 pails of water, and each pail contains 5 liters. So, the amount of water he gets in the morning is 5 pails * 5 liters/pail = 25 liters.

In the afternoon, Baldur gets 6 pails of water, and each pail contains 5 liters. So, the amount of water he gets in the afternoon is 6 pails * 5 liters/pail = 30 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water he gets in the morning and the afternoon to find the total amount of water he gets every day: 25 liters + 30 liters = 55 liters.

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider the monetary reward and the raise in salary.

First, let's calculate the monetary reward: $5000.

Since John received the award on the first day of the year, he will receive the raise for the entire year. The raise is 5% of his weekly salary, which is $2000. 

5% of $2000 is 0.05 * $2000 = $100.

So, his new weekly salary after the raise is $2000 + $100 = $2100.

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the year. There are 52 weeks in a year. 

Total earnings = (Weekly salary * Number of weeks) + Monetary reward
Total earnings = ($2100 * 52) + $5000
Total earnings = $109,800 + $5000
Total earnings = $110,800

The final answer is: $110,800"
"To find the total number of barrels of wine produced, we need to calculate the total number of tons of grapes produced and then multiply it by the number of barrels produced per ton.

First, we calculate the total number of tons of grapes produced per year:
10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons

Next, we multiply the total number of tons by the number of barrels produced per ton:
50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

Therefore, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal and then add them together.

Carl ate a sandwich for lunch every day, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he used 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. So, for 3 days, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

Carl also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese, using 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add up the slices of cheese Carl used: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices of cheese.

"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the number of pens in the bags she bought and add it to the pens she already had.

First, let's calculate the number of pens in the bags she bought:

- Blue pens: 6 bags * 9 pens per bag = 54 pens
- Red pens: 2 bags * 6 pens per bag = 12 pens

Now, let's add the pens she already had to the pens in the bags:

22 (green pens) + 10 (yellow pens) + 54 (blue pens) + 12 (red pens) = 98 pens

Janet now has 98 pens."
"To find the required score, we first need to calculate the total score Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93 after six tests. 

The total score for six tests to achieve an average of 93 is 93 * 6 = 558.

We know Brinley's scores for the first five tests: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. 

The sum of these scores is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 358.

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score among the given scores. The lowest score is 71.

To find the required score for the sixth test, we subtract the sum of the first five scores (excluding the lowest score) from the total required score: 558 - (358 - 71) = 558 - 287 = 271.

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 271 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

"To find the total number of kilometers Micheal rode his bike, we need to calculate the total kilometers he rode in the first four weeks and the total kilometers he rode in the last three weeks.

In the first four weeks, Micheal rode his bike 5 times a week, 25 kilometers each time. So, the total kilometers he rode in the first four weeks is 5 * 25 * 4 = 100 kilometers.

In the last three weeks, Micheal rode his bike 2 times a week, 60 kilometers each time. So, the total kilometers he rode in the last three weeks is 2 * 60 * 3 = 360 kilometers.

To find the total number of kilometers Micheal rode his bike, we need to add the kilometers he rode in the first four weeks and the kilometers he rode in the last three weeks. So, the total kilometers he rode is 100 + 360 = 460 kilometers.

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately and then add them together.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, so each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. Since there are 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples together to get the total weight of the bag of candy: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

The final answer is: 2600"
"To find the total number of cakes Rose bought, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and add them together.

On Monday, she bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add the number of cakes she bought each day: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 cakes.

The total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 76."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that twenty dozen cups is equal to 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

We are also given that the cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each.

Let's denote the total cost of half a dozen plates as 'x'. Since half a dozen plates is equal to 6 plates, we can write the equation as:

20 * 12 = 6 * 6000 - 1200

Simplifying the equation, we get:

240 = 36000 - 1200

240 + 1200 = 36000

360 = 36000

Now, we need to find the cost of each cup. We know that 240 cups cost $360. To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost by the number of cups:

Cost per cup = 360 / 240

Cost per cup = 1.5

Therefore, the total cost of buying each cup is $1.50.

"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn to buy the jacket and shoes. 

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20, so the total cost is $30 + $20 * 2 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs to earn $70 - $10 = $60 more.

She earns $5 per babysitting session and $4 per lawn mowing session. To find out how many times she needs to babysit, we can divide the amount she needs to earn ($60) by the amount she earns per babysitting session ($5). 

$60 / $5 = 12 babysitting sessions.

However, we also need to consider the lawn mowing sessions. We can set up an equation to represent the situation: 

4x + y = 60, where x is the number of babysitting sessions and y is the number of lawn mowing sessions.

Since we know that 12 babysitting sessions will earn her $60, we can substitute x = 12 into the equation:

4(12) + y = 60
48 + y = 60
y = 12

So, Sara needs to mow the lawn 12 times to earn the remaining amount she needs to buy the jacket and shoes."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so we can express this as w = r + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42, and the number of eggs produced by red chickens is 3 times the number of red chickens (3r), and the number of eggs produced by white chickens is 5 times the number of white chickens (5w). Therefore, we can set up the equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find the total time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park since he walks around its edge. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the dimensions of the park (1.5 miles by 6 miles), we can calculate the perimeter as follows:

P = 2(1.5 + 6)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at 3 miles/hour, we can calculate the time he spends walking by dividing the perimeter by his speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find the total number of customers on the first two days. 

Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so the number of customers on the second day is x + 50.

The total number of customers on the first two days is x + (x + 50). We know that the total number of customers by the third day is 500. Since the third day's customers are the sum of the first two days, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 50) + (x + 50) = 500

Combine like terms:

3x + 100 = 500

Subtract 100 from both sides:

3x = 400

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 133.33

Since the number of customers must be a whole number, we can round x to 133. However, we are looking for the number of customers on the third day, which is x + 50. 

x + 50 = 133 + 50 = 183

Therefore, Sloane counted 183 customers on the third day.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool was 2x gallons.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the total amount of water lost from both pools in 4 minutes is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as y gallons. This means the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y gallons.

Since the big pool initially had 2x gallons and lost 16 gallons, the current amount of water in the big pool is 2x - 16. We know this is equal to 4y, so we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4y

We also know that the small pool initially had x gallons and lost 16 gallons, so the current amount of water in the small pool is x - 16. We are told that this is equal to y, so we can set up another equation:

x - 16 = y

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x and y by substituting the expression for y from the second equation into the first equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)
2x - 16 = 4x - 64
-2x = -48
x = 24

Now that we know x, we can find y by substituting x into one of the equations:

y = x - 16
y = 24 - 16
y = 8

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn. 

The total cost of the shoes and the belt is $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00.

Since she earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total amount she needs to earn by her hourly wage to find the number of hours she needs to work:

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

Therefore, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we need to calculate the total amount she will pay over 12 months and subtract it from the initial amount she borrowed.

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. This means she will return $2000 + 10% of $2000, which is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

However, she will only pay $165 per month for 12 months. To find the total amount she will pay, we multiply the monthly payment by the number of months: $165 * 12 = $1980.

Now, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she needs to return: $2200 - $1980 = $220.

So, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be $220.

"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to add the number of roses and dahlias. 

First, we know there are 4 roses. 
Then, we know there are 7 more dahlias than roses, so the number of dahlias is 4 + 7 = 11.

Now, we add the number of roses and dahlias: 4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15.

Therefore, there are 15 flowers in the vase in total."
"To find the current ages of Adrian and Zack, we need to use the given information. 

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as follows:
Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 * 21
Zack's age = 42

Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, we can calculate Adrian's age as follows:
Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 * 21
Adrian's age = 63

Now, we need to find their ages in three years. 
Adrian's age in three years = Adrian's current age + 3
Adrian's age in three years = 63 + 3
Adrian's age in three years = 66

Zack's age in three years = Zack's current age + 3
Zack's age in three years = 42 + 3
Zack's age in three years = 45

Harriet's age in three years = Harriet's current age + 3
Harriet's age in three years = 21 + 3
Harriet's age in three years = 24

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
Average age = (Adrian's age in three years + Zack's age in three years + Harriet's age in three years) / 3
Average age = (66 + 45 + 24) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

The average age of the three in three years is 45."
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna.

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. 
Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 
Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know that the total points scored by all four students is 251. 
We can subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total to find out how many points Jojo scored. 
251 - 68 - 44 - 85 = 54.

"To determine the time it will take for Kalinda and her mom to complete the puzzle, we need to calculate their combined rate of completing the puzzle.

Kalinda can complete 4 pieces per minute, and her mom can complete half as many pieces per minute, which is 2 pieces per minute. 

Combined, they can complete 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Since the puzzle has 360 pieces, we can divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate to find the time it will take to complete the puzzle:

360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

Total slices needed = Number of friends * Slices per friend
Total slices needed = 20 * 4
Total slices needed = 80

Now, we divide the total slices needed by the number of slices per pizza to find out how many pizzas John needs to order:

25 pens / 5 pens per full pen = 5 full pens

Since each full pen can be used to make one new pen, Ram will have 5 new pens. However, he also has the 25 original pens, so the total number of pens he has is:

5 new pens + 25 original pens = 30 pens

The final answer is: 30"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. 

First, Johnny added $10 to his initial $20 allowance, resulting in a total of $30.

Then, the money tripled in value. To find the new amount, we multiply the initial amount by 3. 

$30 * 3 = $90

So, Johnny had $90 after a year.

"To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we need to first determine the ages of Mary and Joan.

Since Jessa is 20 years old, and Joan is five years older than Jessa, Joan's age is 20 + 5 = 25 years.

Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary's age is 25 - 2 = 23 years.

Now, we can find the sum of their ages: 20 (Jessa) + 25 (Joan) + 23 (Mary) = 68 years.

The sum of the ages of the three girls is 68."
"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A: 
   30% of 1000 = 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students.

2. Calculate the number of students remaining after 300 students went out through exit A:
   1000 - 300 = 700 students.

3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B:
   3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students.

4. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C:
   700 - 420 = 280 students.

The number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many candies Robert has. 

Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies, we can set up the equation: 
2 * Robert's candies = 54
Robert's candies = 54 / 2
Robert's candies = 27

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find out how many candies James has. 
James has 6 more candies than Robert, so:
James' candies = Robert's candies + 6
James' candies = 27 + 6
James' candies = 33

Now that we know James has 33 candies, we can find out how many more candies John has than James:
Difference = John's candies - James' candies
Difference = 54 - 33
Difference = 21

The final answer is: 21"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of books each person has and the number of books they read.

Dolly has 2 books.
Pandora has 1 book.

Since they read each other's books as well as their own, we can break it down as follows:

- Dolly reads her own 2 books and Pandora's 1 book, for a total of 3 books.
- Pandora reads her own 1 book and Dolly's 2 books, for a total of 3 books.

Now, we add the total number of books read by both Dolly and Pandora: 3 (Dolly's books) + 3 (Pandora's books) = 6 books.

So, they collectively read 6 books.

"To find out how many letters Mike writes per week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he writes and receives.

He was a pen pal with 5 people, but he stopped being penpals with 2 of them. So, he is now penpals with 5 - 2 = 3 people.

Each person sends 2 letters a week, and Mike responds in kind. Therefore, he receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters per week.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters per week.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages written per week. Each letter is 5 pages long, and he writes 6 letters per week. So, he writes 6 * 5 = 30 pages per week.

Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, we need to find out how many minutes he spends writing per week. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 7 = 420 minutes in a week.

To find out how many minutes he spends writing per week, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he can write per minute. Since he can write 1 page every 6 minutes, he can write 1/6 of a page per minute.

So, the total number of minutes he spends writing per week is 30 pages * 6 minutes per page = 180 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide the total number of minutes by 60. 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.

Therefore, Mike spends 3 hours writing a week.

"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to first calculate the total minutes he has used for his daily calls with his boss. 

Since Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day, and this month has 30 days, the total minutes used for these calls would be:

15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

Additionally, Jason has had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. 

So, the total minutes used would be:
450 minutes (for his boss) + 300 minutes (for other people) = 750 minutes

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from his monthly plan of 1000 minutes to find out how many minutes he has left:

1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

Jason has 250 minutes left for the month."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 fries, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, but we don't know how many she gave yet. Let's call the number of fries Ginger gave 'x'. After Ginger gave her fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now, Griffin has 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We are given that Griffin ended up with 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27.

Solving for x, we get x = 20.

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Since x represents the number of fish in each aquarium, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

14"
"To calculate the total amount Jean paid, we need to first calculate the total hours worked and then the total cost before the discount.

Total hours worked per week = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week
Total hours worked for the movie = 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

The discount is 10% of the total cost before discount.
Discount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000

Total amount paid = Total cost before discount - Discount = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To find out how much each person paid, we need to first calculate the total cost of all the party supplies. 

Total cost = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are 3 people in total. 

Cost per person = Total cost / Number of people
Cost per person = $96 / 3
Cost per person = $32

The final answer is 32."
"To find the total cost, we need to multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply that by the cost per pound.

First, we multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag: 
4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

Next, we multiply the total weight by the cost per pound: 
200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

The chef spent $300."
"To find out how many cookies Sue ate on Monday, we need to multiply the number of cookies her sister ate on Monday by 4. 

Sue's cookies on Monday = 4 * 5 = 20 cookies

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, who ate 13 cookies. 

Sue's cookies on Tuesday = 2 * 13 = 26 cookies

Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 + 26 = 46 cookies

Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies

To find the difference in calories, we multiply the total cookies eaten by each by 200.

Total calories eaten by Sue = 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
Total calories eaten by her sister = 18 * 200 = 3600 calories

Difference in calories = 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the school. Since the school is 50% girls, and there are 3 classes, we can calculate the total number of girls as follows:

Total number of girls = 50% of 3 classes = 0.5 * 3 = 1.5 classes

Since each class has 20 students, we can calculate the total number of students in the school as follows:

Total number of students = 20 students/class * 3 classes = 60 students

Since the school is 50% girls, the number of girls in the school is half of the total number of students:

Number of girls = 50% of 60 students = 0.5 * 60 = 30 girls

We already know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. To find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls:

Number of girls in the third class = Total number of girls - (Number of girls in the first class + Number of girls in the second class)
= 30 - (15 + 12)
= 30 - 27
= 3 girls

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 30. To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the number of girls in the third class from the total number of boys:

Number of boys in the third class = Total number of boys - Number of girls in the third class
= 30 - 3
= 27 boys

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many cougars Rick killed today. We know he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, and he killed 15 cougars the previous night. 

So, the number of cougars killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Now, we know Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today. Since he killed 12 cougars today, the number of wolves he killed is 3 * 12 = 36.

Now, let's add up the total number of animals Rick killed. He killed 10 wolves the previous night and 15 cougars the previous night. Today, he killed 12 cougars and 36 wolves.

Total number of animals killed = 10 (previous night) + 15 (previous night) + 12 (today) + 36 (today) = 73.

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to first determine how many times Anne went down the slide. 

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we can calculate this as follows:

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. 
Therefore, Robert went down the slide 4 * 21 = 84 times.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we first need to determine how many cows were added to each stall. 

Initially, there were 20 cows in each stall. Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and divided them equally among the 20 stalls. 

Number of cows added to each stall = Total cows bought / Number of stalls
= 40 / 20
= 2 cows

Now, we know that each stall initially had 20 cows and 2 cows were added to each stall. 

Number of cows in each stall after adding 2 cows = Initial cows + Added cows
= 20 + 2
= 22 cows

Since we want to know the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in each stall by 8.

Number of cows in 8 stalls = Number of cows in each stall * 8
= 22 * 8

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we first need to calculate the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites. 

Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, we need to find 30% of the total weight of the redwood. 

First, we find 30% of the total weight of the redwood. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the weight of the entire tree by dividing 400 by 10, which equals 40 pounds per foot. 

Now, we multiply 40 pounds per foot by 200 feet to get the total weight of the redwood: 40 * 200 = 8000 pounds. 

Next, we find 30% of 8000 pounds by multiplying 8000 by 0.3, which equals 2400 pounds. 

Now, we subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the redwood: 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many bananas Jamal has. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples, we can find Jamal's apples by subtracting 8 from 52.

Jamal's apples = 52 - 8 = 44

Since Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, we can find Jamal's bananas by adding 4 to his apples.

Jamal's bananas = 44 + 4 = 48

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so we can find Andrea's bananas by dividing Jamal's bananas by 2.

Andrea's bananas = 48 / 2 = 24

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas for both Andrea and Jamal.

Total fruits = Andrea's apples + Andrea's bananas + Jamal's apples + Jamal's bananas
= 52 + 24 + 44 + 48

"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we first need to calculate the amount of flour required for each day separately. 

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen (12) cookies, we can calculate the amount of flour needed for 36 cookies as follows:

36 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 3 dozen
3 dozen = 3 * 2 cups = 6 cups

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. We can calculate the amount of flour needed for 30 cookies as follows:

30 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 2.5 dozen
2.5 dozen = 2.5 * 2 cups = 5 cups

To find the total amount of flour Carla needs, we add the flour required for both days:

"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we need to first determine the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette. 

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches used for the body, which is 900 stitches. 
So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know that the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We also know that the body of the sweater takes 900 stitches. So, the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette is 1800 - 900 = 900 stitches.

Since the collar and the rosette together take 900 stitches, and the rosette takes 180 stitches, the collar must take 900 - 180 = 720 stitches.

Since the sweater has two sleeves, we can divide the total number of stitches for the collar by 2 to find the number of stitches for each sleeve. 
720 / 2 = 360 stitches per sleeve.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has to memorize 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

6S + 9 = 3S + 27
Subtracting 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27
Subtracting 9 from both sides:
3S = 18
Dividing both sides by 3:
S = 6

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

"To find the total amount Peter paid, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars separately and then add them together.

The cost of the popsicles is 20 * $0.25 = $5.
The cost of the ice cream bars is 4 * $0.50 = $2.

The total amount Peter paid is $5 + $2 = $7.

"To find the total number of spots, we first need to find the number of spots on each type of snake. 

Since the cobra has twice as many spots as the mamba, and the cobra has 70 spots, the mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas, so the total number of spots is (40 * 70) + (60 * 35) = 2800 + 2100 = 4900.

Half of the total number of spots is 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is 2450."
"To determine the total number of people attending the soccer game, we need to calculate the number of team members and their guests. 

There are 12 team members, and each team member brings 2 guests. So, the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. 

Adding the team members and their guests, we get 12 + 24 = 36 people.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we need 36 / 3 = 12 pizzas.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost will be 12 * $15 = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To find the total length of the topaz gemstones in a necklace, we multiply the number of gemstones by their length: 8 gemstones * 1 inch = 8 inches.

Since the total length of the necklace is 25 inches, we subtract the length of the gemstones to find the length occupied by the beads: 25 inches - 8 inches = 17 inches.

Now, we divide the length occupied by the beads by the length of each bead to find the number of beads: 17 inches / 0.25 inches = 68 beads.

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

68"
"To calculate the total number of stories written, we need to first find out how many stories each person wrote in the second week. 

In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, so in the second week, she wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories. 
In the first week, Braylen wrote 40 stories, so in the second week, he wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories. 
In the first week, Margot wrote 60 stories, so in the second week, she wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

Now, we add up the total number of stories written by each person in both weeks. 
Alani's total stories = 20 + 40 = 60
Braylen's total stories = 40 + 80 = 120
Margot's total stories = 60 + 120 = 180

The total number of stories written altogether is 60 + 120 + 180 = 360."
"To find the brother's current age, we need to multiply Ann's age by 2. 

Ann's brother's current age = 2 * Ann's age

"To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has and subtract the cost of the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, the total value of the quarters is 5 * 25 = 125 cents.

She also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, the total value of the dimes is 2 * 10 = 20 cents.

The total amount of money Kelly has is 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

The can of pop costs 55 cents. To find out how many cents she will have left, we subtract the cost of the pop from the total amount of money she has: 145 - 55 = 90 cents.

"To find the total number of rows of 5 stars, we first need to determine the total number of stars on the flag. 

The flag has 3 rows of 8 stars, which is 3 * 8 = 24 stars. It also has 2 rows of 6 stars, which is 2 * 6 = 12 stars. 

The total number of stars is 24 + 12 = 36 stars. 

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the remaining stars are 76 - 36 = 40 stars. 

Dividing 40 by 5, we get 40 / 5 = 8. 

Therefore, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag."
"To determine the number of trucks needed, we need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones being transported. 

Since each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, the total weight of 80 flagstones is 80 * 75 = 6000 pounds.

The delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks are needed, we divide the total weight of the flagstones by the truck's capacity:

6000 / 2000 = 3

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to first determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since it's traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 miles/hour / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane. 

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of medals Ali has as A and the number of medals Izzy has as I. We know that Ali has 22 medals, so A = 22.

We also know that Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so I = A - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17.

The total number of medals they have together is A + I = 22 + 17 = 39.

The problem states that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. Let's denote the total number of medals given out as T. This can be represented as:

A + I = 10T / 11

Substituting the values we know, we get:

22 + 17 = 10T / 11

Combine like terms:

39 = 10T / 11

Multiply both sides by 11 to isolate T:

39 * 11 = 10T

429 = 10T

Divide both sides by 10:

T = 429 / 10

T = 42.9

Since the number of medals cannot be a fraction, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this context, it's likely that the question is asking for the exact number of medals given out, so we'll keep the answer as a fraction.

The final answer is 429/10."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available. 

There are 4 adults and 8 children, making a total of 12 people. Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets. 

Total chocolate bars = 8 packets * 5 chocolate bars/packet = 40 chocolate bars

Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults = 4 adults * 6 chocolate bars/adult = 24 chocolate bars

The remaining chocolate bars are for the children. 

Remaining chocolate bars = Total chocolate bars - Chocolate bars given to adults = 40 - 24 = 16 chocolate bars

There are 8 children, and the remaining chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them. 

Number of chocolate bars each child gets = Remaining chocolate bars / Number of children = 16 / 8 = 2 chocolate bars"
"To calculate the total amount of money Susan earns, we need to first determine the total number of minutes she works. 

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works for 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total minutes she works. 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to divide the total minutes she works by 10 to find out how many 10-minute intervals she works. 150 / 10 = 15.

Now, we multiply the number of 10-minute intervals by the amount she earns per interval, which is $5. 15 * $5 = $75.

The final answer is 75."
"To find the initial points of each player, we need to calculate based on the given information.

Mike has 21 points.

Since Jim has 3 points less than Mike, Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.

Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

Now, let's calculate the points after the fourth round. 

In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 

- Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total 22 points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is less than 20, so he doesn't get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is more than 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players after the fourth round: 
Mike has 22 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points. 
Total points = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83 points.

The final answer is: 83"
"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we first need to determine how many oranges each son will wash. 

The oldest son is 8 years old, so he will wash 8 oranges. 

The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. He will wash 4 oranges.

In total, the two sons will wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Will bought 15 oranges, so the number of unwashed oranges is 15 - 12 = 3.

Day 2:
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's add the counts for both days:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

Total count of activities done in the two days: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370"
"To determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day. So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

To find out how many days the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the daily consumption: 42 kg / 2 kg = 21 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of days by 7 to find out how many weeks the rice will last: 21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks.

The 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold. 

He sold 20 crates on the weekend, 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday. 

Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates

Since his target was 120 crates, we subtract the total crates sold from the target to find the difference.

Difference = 120 - 65 = 55 crates

Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week."
"To determine the total cost of the desk, we need to calculate the sequence of bids made by Carmen and the other three people. 

The sequence of bids starts at $200. Each subsequent bid increases by $50. 

The first bid is $200. 
The second bid is $250 (200 + 50). 
The third bid is $300 (250 + 50). 
The fourth bid is $350 (300 + 50). 
The fifth bid is $400 (350 + 50). 
The sixth bid is $450 (400 + 50). 
The seventh bid is $500 (450 + 50). 
The eighth bid is $550 (500 + 50). 

Carmen bids after each of the other three people, so she bids at $250, $300, and $350. 

The final bid is $550, and Carmen wins the desk. 

To find the total cost of the desk, we need to add the bids made by Carmen to the final bid. 
Total cost = $200 + $250 + $300 + $350 + $400 + $450 + $500 + $550 + $250 + $300 + $350 = $3500.

The desk costs Carmen $3500."
"To calculate the total cost of driving, we need to calculate the total miles driven per year and the total miles driven per day.

Total miles driven per year = 2 * 30 miles * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 30,000 miles/year

Total miles driven per day = 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles/day

Total miles driven per month = 60 miles/day * 30 days/month = 1,800 miles/month

Total miles driven per year = 1,800 miles/month * 12 months/year = 21,600 miles/year

Now, let's calculate the total cost of driving:

Total miles driven per year * cost per mile = 21,600 miles/year * $2/mile = $43,200/year

Additionally, John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Total bonus per year = $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800/year

Total cost per year = $43,200/year + $1,800/year = $45,000/year

"To find out how much time Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total time he exercised on Monday and Sunday. 

On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes. 
On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes. 
The total time he exercised on Monday and Sunday is 16 + 23 = 39 minutes.

Since Peter wants to exercise twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we multiply the total time by 2. 
2 * 39 = 78 minutes.

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding pattern. 

When folding the paper, we create two separate sections: one for the left side (pages 1-16) and one for the right side (pages 17-32). 

For the left side, we need 16 pieces of paper (one for each page). 

For the right side, we need 16 pieces of paper as well (one for each page). 

However, when we fold the paper, the front and back sides are combined, so we need to account for this. 

Since we have 16 pieces for the left side and 16 pieces for the right side, we need a total of 16 + 16 = 32 pieces of paper. 

But, we also need to consider that the last piece of paper (page 32) is on the right back, and the first piece of paper (page 1) is on the left front. This means that the last piece of paper (page 32) is actually the same as the first piece of paper (page 1), so we don't need an additional piece.

Therefore, the total number of pieces of paper needed is 32.

"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the initial amount.

Annika spent half of $50 on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25.
She also spent an additional $10 on rides.

Total amount spent = $25 (food and snacks) + $10 (rides) = $35

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to first determine the number of books she sold in the second year. 

Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, and she sold 45 books this year, she must have sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We know that she has 250 books in total and 50 unsold books, so the total number of books sold in the first two years is 250 - 50 = 200 books.

Since she sold 90 books in the first year, she must have sold 200 - 90 = 110 books in the second year.

Each book sells for 20$, so the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 110 * 20 = 2200$.

His regular earnings for April would be 20 days * $10/hour = $200.

Since the company performed well for the whole month, Watson gets a $300 bonus. 

So, his total earnings for April would be $200 (regular earnings) + $300 (bonus) = $500.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand that if Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can find the rate at which Joey loses weight per week by dividing the weight lost by the number of weeks.

Weight lost by Joey per week = Total weight lost / Number of weeks
Weight lost by Joey per week = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weight lost by Joey per week = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, we can find the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight by dividing the total weight by the weight lost per week.

Number of weeks for Sandy to lose the same amount of weight = Total weight lost / Weight lost per week
Number of weeks for Sandy to lose the same amount of weight = 8 pounds / 2 pounds per week
Number of weeks for Sandy to lose the same amount of weight = 4 weeks

"To determine the total number of new limbs, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs the person will grow in the first 15 days.

In the first 3 days, the person will grow 1 extra arm.
In the next 3 days (4-6 days), the person will grow 1 extra leg.
In the next 3 days (7-9 days), the person will grow 1 extra arm.
In the next 3 days (10-12 days), the person will grow 1 extra leg.
In the next 3 days (13-15 days), the person will grow 1 extra arm.

Since the person grows an extra arm every 3 days and an extra leg every 5 days, we can observe a pattern. In 15 days, the person will grow 5 extra arms (1 in the first 3 days, 1 in the next 3 days, 1 in the next 3 days, 1 in the next 3 days, and 1 in the last 3 days) and 3 extra legs (1 in the 4-6 days, 1 in the 10-12 days, and 1 in the 13-15 days).

"To determine how much Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners, we need to calculate the total amount he has available for the trip after setting aside $2000 for savings.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits: 
6 business suits * $100 each = $600

Next, calculate the total cost of the suitcases: 
3 suitcases * $50 each = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. 
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
$700 more than that = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the trip so far: 
$600 (business suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950

Since Theo wants to save $2000, we subtract this from his total budget: 
$6000 (initial budget) - $2000 (savings) = $4000

Now, we subtract the total cost of the trip from the remaining budget: 
$4000 - $1950 = $2050

Therefore, Theo has $2050 left to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

Three people eat three eggs each day, so they consume 3 * 3 = 9 eggs per day. 

Two people eat two eggs each day, so they consume 2 * 2 = 4 eggs per day.

The total number of eggs consumed per day is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote Noah's current age as N and Cera's current age as C. We are given that Cera is currently 46 years old, so C = 46.

We are also given that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. This means that six years ago, Noah's age was N - 6, and Cera's age was C - 6. Since Noah was half as old as Cera six years ago, we can set up the equation:

N - 6 = (1/2)(C - 6)

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Let's denote the population of Chile six years ago as P. We can set up the equation:

P = 3000(N - 6)

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. This means that the current population of Chile is 2P. We can set up the equation:

2P = current population of Chile

We know that the current population of Chile is equal to the population six years ago plus the increase in population over the past six years. The increase in population over the past six years is equal to the current population of Chile minus the population six years ago. We can set up the equation:

2P = P + (current population of Chile - P)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2P = P + current population of Chile - P
2P = current population of Chile - P
3P = current population of Chile

Now we can substitute the expression for P from the first equation:

3(3000(N - 6)) = current population of Chile

Now we can substitute the value of C into the equation N - 6 = (1/2)(C - 6):

N - 6 = (1/2)(46 - 6)
N - 6 = (1/2)(40)
N - 6 = 20
N = 26

Now we can substitute the value of N into the equation 3(3000(N - 6)) = current population of Chile:

3(3000(26 - 6)) = current population of Chile
3(3000(20)) = current population of Chile
3(60000) = current population of Chile
180000 = current population of Chile

The final answer is: 180000"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'x'. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

The problem also states that there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is x/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms:

7x = 210

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

There are 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 * 4 = 12 people. 
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people. 
We subtract these 2 people from the total number of people who could attend: 16 - 2 = 14.

Therefore, 14 people show up for Martha's party."
"To find the total weight of marbles, we first need to calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has. 

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 

2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. 

So, Solomon's father gave him 8 marbles. 

Now, we add the marbles Solomon bought from Johanna (20) to the marbles his father gave him (8) to get the total number of marbles: 20 + 8 = 28.

The store already had 50 marbles. 

The total number of marbles in the store is 50 (initial marbles) + 28 (marbles bought and given by Solomon) = 78.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble to get the total weight: 78 * 2 = 156.

The total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 156 kgs."

V = 6 * 4 * 5
V = 120 cubic feet

Since it costs $.1 per cubic foot to fill the pool, the total cost is:

Cost = Volume * Price per cubic foot
Cost = 120 * $.1
Cost = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to first find the number of girls and nongendered children.

Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.

The number of nongendered children is 1/10 of the number of boys, which is 1/10 * 30 = 3.

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

The total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to first determine the number of electric poles. 

Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles. 

Let's denote the number of electric poles as x. Since the ratio of poles to wires is 1:3, the number of wires will be 3x. 

We are given that the total number of electric wires is 45. So, we can set up the equation 3x = 45.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3: 
x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

"To find the total number of people at the party initially, we need to add the number of men and women. 

Total people = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who left as follows:

Number of people who left = 1/4 * 40 = 10 people

Since 22 men stayed at the party, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3 men.

Now, we know that 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men. So, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7 women.

To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:

Number of women left = 15 - 7 = 8 women

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the cost of the pen, we need to first find the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Since the pen costs $1 less than the magazine, the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1.

The final answer is 1."
"To find the total number of pencils, we need to add the pencils Jam has to the pencils Meg has. 

Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, so the total number of pencils Jam has is 3 * 24 (assuming each box has 24 pencils) + 2 = 74.

Adding Meg's pencils, the total number of pencils is 74 + 46 = 120.

Since each box can hold 24 pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by 24 to find the number of boxes needed: 120 / 24 = 5.

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 5 boxes to store all their pencils.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the effect of adding cream.

First, let's calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can divide 65 by 13 to find the number of ice cubes needed:

65 / 13 = 5

So, 5 ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the total volume of the coffee after adding the ice cubes. Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, we can multiply the number of ice cubes by 12:

5 * 12 = 60 milliliters

This means the coffee is 60 milliliters weaker after adding the ice cubes.

Next, we need to add 15 milliliters of cream, which will make the coffee 15 milliliters weaker. So, the total weakening effect of the cream is 15 milliliters.

Now, we add the weakening effects of the ice cubes and the cream:

60 + 15 = 75 milliliters

Therefore, Shannon's iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

Final answer: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the ratio of old records to new records. We know that for every 2 old records, 1 new record is obtained. 

Given that 5 people come in and leave with 7 new records, we can set up an equation to represent the situation. Let's assume the number of old records brought in by the 5 people is x.

Since each person trades 2 old records for 1 new record, the total number of old records traded is 2x. However, this is the total number of old records traded, not the total number of old records brought in. Since 5 people are involved, the total number of old records brought in is 5x.

We know that the total number of new records obtained is 7. Since each trade involves 2 old records for 1 new record, the total number of old records traded is 7. Therefore, we can set up the equation 2x = 7.

However, this equation doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. The correct equation should be 5x = 7, since 5 people brought in a total of 5x old records.

Solving for x, we get x = 7/5. However, since x represents the number of old records brought in by each person, it must be a whole number. 

Let's re-examine the problem. If 5 people come in and leave with 7 new records, and each person trades 2 old records for 1 new record, the total number of old records traded is indeed 7. But this is the number of old records traded, not the number of old records brought in. 

Since each person brings in 2 old records for every 1 new record they take, and there are 7 new records, the total number of old records brought in must be 7 * 2 = 14.

Therefore, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records.

"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the number of junior programmers, the number of senior programmers, and their respective salaries.

Given that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, and there are 100 employees in total, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100 = 40

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, and junior programmers are paid $2000 per month, we can calculate the salary of senior programmers as follows:

Salary of senior programmers = $2000 + $400 = $2400

Now, we can calculate the total number of senior programmers as follows:

Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
= 100 - 40
= 60

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month as follows:

Total amount = (Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers) + (Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers)
= (40 * $2000) + (60 * $2400)
= $80000 + $144000
= $184000

The final answer is: $184000"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the total number of people heading to the third stop. 

We know that at the third stop, there were 20 people. 

At the second stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in. So, the number of people at the second stop is 20 - 7 + 8 = 21.

At the first stop, 5 more people got in. So, the number of people at the first stop is 21 - 5 = 16.

Therefore, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 16.

"To solve this problem, we need to track the changes in Oscar's lollipop count step by step.

Initially, Oscar has 24 lollipops.

1. He eats 2 on his way to school: 24 - 2 = 22
2. He passes 14 out to his friends: 22 - 14 = 8
3. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends: 2 * 14 = 28, so he buys 28 more lollipops. Now he has 8 + 28 = 36
4. He eats 3 more that night: 36 - 3 = 33
5. He eats 2 more in the morning: 33 - 2 = 31

Therefore, Oscar has 31 lollipops.

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to hours.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge.

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it takes to recharge 40% as follows:

40% / 1% = 40
40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the total amount they spent after applying the rewards and the coupon.

First, let's calculate the rewards they received. They spent $80 and get $1 off for every $20 spent. So, they get $80 / $20 = 4 rewards. 

Since the rewards are $1 off, they get a total of 4 * $1 = $4 off.

However, the coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off, so the coupon takes 2 * $4 = $8 off.

Now, let's calculate the total amount they paid. They initially spent $80, then got $4 off, and then got $8 off from the coupon. So, the total amount they paid is $80 - $4 - $8 = $68.

The customer paid $68 on this shopping trip."
"To determine the net pay for each job, we need to calculate the total annual income and then subtract the taxes.

Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Total hours worked: 2000 hours
- Total annual income: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Total tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:
- Annual income: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax on net income: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Comparing the net pay of both jobs, Job B has a higher net pay rate. To find the difference, subtract the lower net pay from the higher net pay:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is $8,400."
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we need to calculate 40% of 220, which represents the number of ruined castles, and then divide that number by 2, since half of the ruined castles are unmanned.

First, calculate 40% of 220:
40% of 220 = 0.4 * 220 = 88

Then, divide the result by 2:
88 / 2 = 44

Therefore, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

We know that the total number of students is 200, so we can set up the following equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x + 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x + 20 = 200

Subtract 20 from both sides:

3x = 180

Divide both sides by 3:

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of chickens and cows. We know that Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows. Let's denote the number of cows as 'x'. Since he has twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens will be 2x.

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation:

x (cows) + 2x (chickens) = 60

Combine like terms:

3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 20

So, there are 20 cows and 2x = 40 chickens.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs:

Cows have 4 legs each, so 20 cows have 20 * 4 = 80 legs.
Chickens have 2 legs each, so 40 chickens have 40 * 2 = 80 legs.

The total number of legs is 80 (cows) + 80 (chickens) = 160 legs.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the weight of each animal and then add the weight of the container.

We know the pink frog weighs 50 pounds. Since the pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we have the weights of all the animals: 
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

The total weight of the animals is 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 pounds.

"To find the total time John spent on vacation, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them up.

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. 

He watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so he spent 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows.

The total time spent on these activities is 6 (boating) + 3 (swimming) + 6 (watching shows) = 15 hours.

Since 30% of his time was spent watching shows, we can set up an equation to find the total time spent on vacation: 0.3x = 15, where x is the total time spent on vacation.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 0.3: x = 15 / 0.3 = 50.

"To determine the number of friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has available for the activities. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the activities: 

- 1 round of mini-golf costs $5
- 2 rides on the go-karts cost 2 * $10 = $20
- Arcade tokens cost $5

Total cost of activities = $5 + $20 + $5 = $30

Now, let's subtract the total cost of activities from the total budget:

"To find out how much money Marisa saves in her piggy bank, we need to calculate the total amount of money she spends on lollipops and subtract that from her daily pocket money.

Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day. She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, which is $0.25 per lollipop. 

Total cost of lollipops per day = 4 * $0.25 = $1
Total cost of lollipops for 5 days = $1 * 5 = $5

Since Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day, she saves the difference between her pocket money and the cost of lollipops.

Total savings = $5 (pocket money) - $5 (cost of lollipops) = $0

Therefore, Marisa saves $0 in her piggy bank for 5 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Billy spent on gumballs. Since each gumball costs $0.05 and he bought 40 gumballs, the total cost of gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since Billy took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, the amount of money he had left is also $2. This means he had $10 - $2 = $8 left.

Now, we know that the candy costs $1.5 per pound. Let's denote the number of pounds of candy Billy bought as 'x'. The total amount of money he had left ($8) is equal to the cost of the candy (1.5x) plus the cost of the gumballs ($2). So, we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 2 = 8

Subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation gives us:

1.5x = 6

Dividing both sides by 1.5 gives us:

x = 4

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S. 

We know that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, so we can write the equation as:

C = 2S - 5

We also know that Carver is 45 years old, so we can substitute C with 45:

45 = 2S - 5

Now, we can solve for S by adding 5 to both sides of the equation:

45 + 5 = 2S - 5 + 5
50 = 2S

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

50 / 2 = 2S / 2
25 = S

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To determine the total distance traveled by the train in one trip, we need to calculate the distance from the first city to the third city. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles, and the distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the other two, so it is 75 + 100 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance for one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance covered in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance by the service interval: 18,000 / 900 = 20.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the amount of stuffing needed for each type of bed, we need to calculate the average amount of stuffing for the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds.

The Rottweiler bed requires 8 pounds of stuffing, and the chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing. 

The average amount of stuffing for the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.

For 4 chihuahua beds, the total amount of stuffing needed is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

For 3 collie beds, the total amount of stuffing needed is 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

The total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds is 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time taken for the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the journey and then add them together.

First, we calculate the time taken to drive to his friend's house:
Distance = 200 miles
Speed = 70 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 200 / 70 = 2.86 hours

Next, we add the detour distance:
Detour distance = 10 miles
Total distance to his friend's house = 200 + 10 = 210 miles
Time taken to drive to his friend's house = 210 / 70 = 3 hours

Now, we calculate the time taken to drive back home:
Distance = 240 miles
Speed = 80 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 240 / 80 = 3 hours

Total time taken for the trip = Time taken to drive to his friend's house + Time taken to drive back home
Total time taken = 3 + 3 = 6 hours

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to subtract the number of absent students from the total number of students and then subtract the number of absent girls.

Total students = 96
Absent students = 5 girls + 4 boys = 9
Number of absent boys = 4

Number of present students = Total students - Absent students
= 96 - 9
= 87

Since we are asked to find the number of boys, we need to subtract the number of absent girls from the total number of students.

Number of boys = Total students - Number of absent girls
= 96 - 5
= 91

Therefore, there were 91 fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as x. 

We are given that 3x - 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 

We also know that 3 times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, which means 3(3x - 5) were kicked out for physical violence.

The total number of people kicked out is 50. 

We can set up the equation: x + (3x - 5) + 3(3x - 5) = 50.

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 3x - 5 + 9x - 15 = 50.

Combine like terms: 13x - 20 = 50.

Add 20 to both sides: 13x = 70.

Divide by 13: x = 5.38 (round down to 5 since we can't have a fraction of a person).

Now that we know x, we can find the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks (5), the number of shoplifters (3x - 5 = 3(5) - 5 = 10), and the number of people kicked out for physical violence (3(3x - 5) = 3(10) = 30).

The number of people kicked out for other reasons is the total number of people kicked out minus the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence: 50 - 5 - 10 - 30 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to first find out how many points Sara had before. Since Sara scored 8 points and Erin scored 14 points, and Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can set up an equation.

Let's denote the number of points Sara had before as 'x'. Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, Erin's points can be represented as 3x. We know that Erin scored 14 points, so we can set up the equation:

3x = 14

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3:

x = 14 / 3
x = 4.67

Since we can't have a fraction of a point, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this context, it's more logical to assume that Sara had 4 points before, as the question implies that Erin scored 14 points after scoring 8. 

So, Erin had 3 * 4 = 12 points before scoring 8.

The final answer is 12."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the expenses into different categories.

1. Picture frames: 
   - Each frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched with a logo, which adds 20% of the cost. 
   - 20% of $20 is $4.
   - So, the total cost per frame is $20 + $4 = $24.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. Pins:
   - 2 seniors will receive pins, each costing $5.
   - The total cost for pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. Cords for officers:
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 officers.
   - Each cord costs $12.
   - The total cost for cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, let's add up the costs:
- Total cost for picture frames: $1056
- Total cost for pins: $10
- Total cost for cords: $132
- Total cost for senior gifts: $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198

The total cost for the senior gifts is $1198."
"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the cost of the materials first. 

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. Since Ethan saves 20% by making his own, the cost of the materials will be 80% of the original cost.

Materials cost = 80% of $400 = 0.8 * $400 = $320

The total cost for Ethan will be the cost of the materials plus the cost of his time. However, the problem does not provide information about the cost of his time. 

Therefore, we can only calculate the cost of the materials, which is $320."
"To determine the total number of tennis shoes sold, we need to calculate the sales for each day and then subtract the returns.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

The total number of pairs sold is 14 + 28 + 14 = 56 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs, so we need to subtract those from the total. 

Total pairs sold = 56 - 6 = 50 pairs.

"To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to calculate the number of faulty pieces of equipment and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

Given that 40% of the equipment were faulty, we can calculate the number of faulty pieces as follows:

Number of faulty pieces = 40% of $400,000
= 0.4 * $400,000
= $160,000

Since the total cost of the equipment is $400,000 and the faulty pieces are worth $160,000, the cost of the functioning pieces can be calculated as follows:

Cost of functioning pieces = Total cost - Cost of faulty pieces
= $400,000 - $160,000
= $240,000

Therefore, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000."
"To find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from each half of the sheep and then add them together.

Since Mary has 30 sheep, she has 15 sheep in each half. 

She gets 1 kg of milk from half of the sheep, which is 15 sheep. So, the milk from this half is 15 * 1 = 15 kg.

She gets 2 kg of milk from the other half, which is also 15 sheep. So, the milk from this half is 15 * 2 = 30 kg.

Now, we add the milk from both halves: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

Therefore, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day.

"To find out how many pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we first need to determine how many rolls were left after feeding her 6 children. 

Since she started with a dozen (12) rolls and fed 6 children, she had 12 - 6 = 6 rolls left.

Then, she broke each of the remaining 6 rolls into 8 pieces. To find the total number of pieces, we multiply the number of rolls by the number of pieces each roll was broken into: 6 * 8 = 48.

Therefore, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

"To find the number of pupils who like yellow, we first need to determine the number of pupils who like blue and the number of pupils who like green.

Since half of the class likes blue, we can calculate this as follows:
40 / 2 = 20 pupils like blue.

Now, we need to find the number of pupils who like green. One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. The remaining pupils are 40 - 20 = 20.

One-fourth of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5 pupils like green.

To find the number of pupils who like yellow, we subtract the number of pupils who like blue and green from the total number of pupils:
40 - 20 (blue) - 5 (green) = 15 pupils like yellow.

"To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we need to first determine the number of apples picked on each day.

On Monday, Lucy sold all the apples she picked, and she got $56 from selling them at $4 per piece. So, the number of apples picked on Monday is 56 / 4 = 14.

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked over the three days by adding the number of apples picked on each day: 14 + 12 + 24 = 50.

"To find out how many socks Lindsay has missed, we need to first determine the total number of socks she has washed. 

She washed 10 pairs of socks, and since each pair consists of 2 socks, she washed 10 * 2 = 20 socks. 

Additionally, she washed 15 loose socks. 

So, the total number of socks she has washed is 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks in total, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is 50 - 35 = 15 socks.

"To find out how many cookies are left for Rachel, we need to subtract the number of cookies she initially had, the number of cookies Janet gave her, and the number of cookies her brother ate.

Initial cookies: 23
Cookies from Janet: 42
Cookies eaten by brother: 44

Total cookies initially: 23 + 42 = 65
Total cookies eaten or given away: 65 + 44 = 109

Now, subtract the total cookies eaten or given away from the initial total: 65 - 109 = -44

Since we can't have a negative number of cookies, this means that Rachel actually had more cookies than she thought. To find the correct number of cookies left, we need to subtract the total cookies eaten or given away from the initial number of cookies Rachel had.

Initial cookies: 23
Cookies eaten or given away: 44

Cookies left: 23 - 44 = -21

However, since we can't have a negative number of cookies, this means that the initial number of cookies Rachel had was not enough to cover the cookies eaten or given away. In this case, we need to re-evaluate the initial number of cookies.

Let's re-evaluate the initial number of cookies: 23 + 42 = 65

Now, subtract the total cookies eaten or given away from the initial total: 65 - 44 = 21

Cookies left: 21

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the monthly interest and add it to the principal amount.

The formula for calculating monthly interest is: 

Monthly interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 12

Given values: 
Principal (P) = $3,650
Rate (R) = 10% or 0.10
Time (T) = 5 months

Monthly interest = (3650 * 0.10 * 5) / 12
Monthly interest = 146.88

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, the total amount she has to pay per month is the sum of the principal and the monthly interest.

Monthly payment = Principal + Monthly interest
Monthly payment = 3650 + 146.88
Monthly payment = 3796.88

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the amount of silver and gold they have.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 (Axel's) + 100 (Anna's) = 150.

The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 (Axel's) + 120 (Anna's) = 200.

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 (silver) + 200 (gold) = 350.

"To determine the profit per hour, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make with the supplies she bought. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she bought enough supplies for 3 pitchers, she can make 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

Next, we need to calculate the total revenue. Since she sells each cup of lemonade for $1 and she sells 4 cups per hour, her revenue per hour is 4 * $1 = $4.

Now, let's calculate the total cost. She spent $18 to buy the supplies, and she can make 36 cups of lemonade. To find the cost per cup, we divide the total cost by the total number of cups: $18 / 36 = $0.5 per cup.

The profit per hour is the revenue per hour minus the cost per cup. Since she sells 4 cups per hour, her profit per hour is $4 - (4 * $0.5) = $4 - $2 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the original amount of land as x hectares.

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, the amount he sold is 3/5 * x hectares. The amount he has left is 12.8 hectares, which is 2/5 of the original amount (since 1 - 3/5 = 2/5).

We can set up the equation as follows:

2/5 * x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"To calculate the savings, we need to first find the cost of the bundled services. 

The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus together is $10 + $10 = $20. Since Tim gets a 20% discount for bundling, we need to calculate 20% of $20.

20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4

So, the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the cable package, which is $60. 

The savings from cancelling the cable package is $60 - $16 = $44.

"To determine how many days Mark needs to save his money, we need to subtract the cost of the bike from the amount he has in his bank account and then divide the result by his daily earnings.

Mark has $50 initially and needs $300 for the bike. 

$50 (initial amount) - $300 (bike cost) = -$250 (shortfall)

Since Mark can't save a negative amount, this means he doesn't have enough money to buy the bike. He needs more than $300.

However, if we consider the scenario where Mark can save more money, we can calculate the number of days he needs to save:

$300 (bike cost) / $10 (daily earnings) = 30 days

So, if Mark saves his earnings every day, it would take him 30 days to save $300, but he still wouldn't have enough money to buy the bike."

7200 watts/day * 30 days = 216,000 watts

Since 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts, we convert the total energy to kilowatts: 
216,000 watts / 1000 = 216 kilowatts

Now, we calculate the new daily energy usage after reducing the time by 5 hours: 
900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watts/day

The energy saved per day is the difference between the original and new daily usage: 
7200 watts - 2700 watts = 4500 watts/day

Now, we calculate the total energy saved in 30 days: 
4500 watts/day * 30 days = 135,000 watts

Converting this to kilowatts: 
135,000 watts / 1000 = 135 kilowatts

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the average number of stripes, we need to first find the total number of stripes. 

There are two zebras with 17 stripes each, so that's 2 x 17 = 34 stripes. 

There is one zebra with 36 stripes. 

The third zebra has half the number of stripes of the zebra with 36 stripes, so it has 36 / 2 = 18 stripes. 

Now, we add up all the stripes: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes. 

To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras: 88 / 3 = 29.33. 

The average number of stripes is 29.33."
"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we need to calculate the total amount of each required for 20 people.

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and each sandwich serves 4 people, we can calculate the total amount of each needed for 20 people as follows:

- Meat: 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches. Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat, we need 5 pounds of meat.
- Cheese: 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches. Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of cheese, we need 5 pounds of cheese.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese:

- Cost of meat: 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
- Cost of cheese: 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

$50.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in his house.

We know that Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, we can set up an equation to find the number of corns:

Let's denote the number of corns as C. Since there are twice as many corns as cannolis, we can write:

C = 2 * 40
C = 80

Now, we know that Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is:

40 + 60 = 100 cannolis

We also know that he bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. So, the new total number of corns is:

100 - 40 = 60 corns

Now, we can find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis:

Total = 80 (corns) + 100 (cannolis)
Total = 180

The final answer is: 180"
"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first calculate the total steps he completed before the jog. 

Elliott finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. He also did 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, the total steps completed before the jog is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. To find out how many steps he took during the jog, we subtract the remaining steps from the total steps completed before the jog. 

Steps taken during the jog = Total steps completed before the jog - Remaining steps
Steps taken during the jog = 6,000 - 2,000
Steps taken during the jog = 4,000

The final answer is: 4,000"
"To determine how many minutes it will take Toby to finish the book, we need to calculate the total number of words in the book and then divide that by his reading rate.

The book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page, so the total number of words is 45 * 200 = 9000 words.

Toby can read 300 words per minute, so the time it will take him to finish the book is 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes.

Toby needs to be at the airport in 60 minutes, and it takes him 10 minutes to get there, so he will arrive at the airport 60 - 10 = 50 minutes after he finishes the book.

Since it will take him 30 minutes to finish the book, he will arrive 50 - 30 = 20 minutes early.

The final answer is: 20"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. 

Total hours worked in May = 40 employees * 40 hours/week = 1600 hours
Total amount paid in May = 1600 hours * $15/hour = $24,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the company had 3/4 of the original 40 employees, which is 30 employees.

Total hours worked in June = 30 employees * 40 hours/week = 1200 hours
Total amount paid in June = 1200 hours * $15/hour = $18,000

Total amount paid in the two months = $24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds, and the first pound is full price ($3), the second pound is half off ($3 * 0.5 = $1.50). So, the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50, and the magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1. So, the total cost of the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1 = $2.50.

Now, let's add the cost of the taffy and the seashells and magnets to find the total cost of all the items: $4.50 + $2.50 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

$3"
"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks first. 

The first package costs $400. The second package is worth twice that much, so it costs 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packages, so the discount amount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

The discounted cost of the two packages is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Adding the cost of the finale firework, the total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine the number of dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she needs for 30 days. Since she eats 2 cookies per night, she will need 2 * 30 = 60 cookies for 30 days.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she needs (60) by the number of cookies her recipe makes (12). 

60 / 12 = 5

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days."
"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to calculate the number of candles that have the defect (smell like wet dog) and then find the intersection with the number of candles that explode.

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the candles have this defect, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of candles smelling like wet dog = Total number of candles * Percentage of candles smelling like wet dog
= 50000 * 0.05
= 2500

Now, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, the problem doesn't provide a direct relationship between the two defects. Assuming the defects are independent, we can't determine the exact number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. The problem only states that 5% of the candles have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog, but it doesn't specify that this defect also causes them to explode.

Therefore, we can't provide an accurate numerical answer for the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode.

However, if we assume that the 5% of candles with the wet dog smell defect also have the explosion defect, then we can calculate it as follows:

Number of candles smelling like wet dog and exploding = Number of candles smelling like wet dog
= 2500

Please note that this assumption is not supported by the problem statement, and the actual number could be different."
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to calculate the discount amount and then subtract it from the regular price of the blouses.

First, we need to find the discount amount. Since Misha picks out 4 blouses and the discount is 30%, we can calculate the discount amount as follows:

Discount amount = 30% of $20
= 0.3 * $20
= $6

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the discounted blouses:

Total cost = Regular price - Discount amount
= $20 - $6
= $14

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is $14.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's denote the number of apples gathered from the tallest trees as T, the number of apples gathered from the shortest trees as S, and the number of apples gathered from the average trees as A.

From the problem, we know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so T = 30.

We also know that Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so S = 30/2 = 15.

Since Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, her sister gathers 2T = 2(30) = 60 apples from the tallest trees.

Since Joanne's sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, her sister gathers 3S = 3(15) = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

We know that the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, so we can set up the equation:

T + S + A = 500

Substituting the values we know, we get:

30 + 15 + A = 500

Combine like terms:

45 + A = 500

Subtract 45 from both sides:

A = 455

Therefore, Joanne gathered 455 apples from the average trees.

The final answer is: 455"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, the total number of bumps can be represented as 2C + D = 304.

We also know that the total number of heads is 180, and since each animal has one head, we can represent this as C + D = 180.

Now, we have two equations:

1) 2C + D = 304
2) C + D = 180

We can solve these equations simultaneously. Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1), we get:

2C + D - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know C, we can substitute this value into equation (2) to find D:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 180 - 124
D = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.

"To find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we need to break it down into parts.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers.

So, the total distance covered in the first 6 days is 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers.

On the next day, Tom wasn't traveling at all, so we don't need to add any distance to this.

During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance covered in the second week is 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, we add the distances covered in the first 6 days and the second week to get the total distance traveled. 1040 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

The final answer is: 3140"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can set up the equation:

Peter's locker = 1/4 * Zack's locker
5 = 1/4 * Zack's locker

To solve for Zack's locker, we can multiply both sides by 4:

Zack's locker = 5 * 4
Zack's locker = 20 cubic inches

Now that we know Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches, we can find Timothy's locker, which is half as big as Zack's locker:

Timothy's locker = 1/2 * Zack's locker
Timothy's locker = 1/2 * 20
Timothy's locker = 10 cubic inches

"To find the elevation at which Oliver must climb to reach Stanley's comb, we need to calculate the difference in elevation between the point where the comb landed and Oliver's current elevation.

The comb fell from 10,000 feet to 6,000 feet (10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000). 

Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. 

To find the elevation at which Oliver must climb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the elevation of the comb: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet.

"To find the total amount of capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to add the initial amount of capital he had to the amount he received from the two banks.

Initial capital: $5000
Amount received from the first bank: $4000
Amount received from the second bank: $4000 (twice as much as the first bank)
Total amount received from both banks: $4000 + $4000 = $8000

Now, let's add the initial capital to the total amount received from the banks:
$5000 (initial capital) + $8000 (total amount received) = $13000

Therefore, Mr. Josue now has $13000 in capital.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we calculate the number of cats taken away by the boats: 4 boats * 5 cats per boat = 20 cats.
2. Then, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30 cats.
3. Next, we calculate 3/5 of the remaining cats: 3/5 * 30 = 18 cats.
4. Finally, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12 cats.

There were 12 cats left on the rock."
"To calculate the cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break down the cost into three periods: the first 6 months, the next 8 months, and the final 20 months.

1. The first 6 months: 6 months * $8/month = $48
2. The next 8 months: 8 months * $12/month = $96
3. The final 20 months: 20 months * $14/month = $280

Now, we add the costs of all three periods: $48 + $96 + $280 = $424

The total cost of 2 years of the service is $424."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the original price of the jogger jeans. 

Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the original price of the tattered jeans is x + 6.

The total savings from the jogger jeans is 1/3 of its original price, which is (1/3)x. The total savings from the tattered jeans is $6. 

Since the total savings is the sum of the savings from both jeans, we can set up the equation:

(1/3)x + 6 = 6

Subtracting 6 from both sides gives us:

x = 0

However, this is still not possible. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

The total savings from the jogger jeans is 1/3 of its original price, and the total savings from the tattered jeans is $6. Since the total savings is $6, we can set up the equation:

"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and add them together.

- 4 buses with a capacity of 60 employees each can hold 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
- 6 minibusses with a capacity of 30 employees each can hold 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
- 10 minivans with a capacity of 15 employees each can hold 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, let's add the capacities of all vehicles together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

Therefore, a total of 570 employees can join the day trip.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder. 

Let's denote the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders as x. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is x + 10.

We know that Lillian builds 3 homemade feeders and buys 3 store-bought feeders. So, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10), and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x.

Since the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same, we can set up the equation:

3(x + 10) = 3x

Expanding the equation, we get:

3x + 30 = 3x

Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get:

30 = 0

This equation is not true, which means that the initial assumption that the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same is incorrect. However, we can still solve for x.

Let's re-examine the problem. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, we can set up the equation:

3(x + 10) = 3x + 30

Expanding the equation, we get:

3x + 30 = 3x + 30

This equation is true for any value of x, which means that the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is indeed 10 more than the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders.

Since Lillian builds 3 homemade feeders and buys 3 store-bought feeders, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10), and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x.

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is the sum of the birds attracted to both types of feeders:

3(x + 10) + 3x = 3x + 30 + 3x = 6x + 30

Since we don't know the value of x, we can't determine the exact number of birds. However, we can express the total number of birds as 6x + 30.

The final answer is: 6x + 30"
"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The bagel costs $4. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, so the soup costs $4 + (25% of $4) = $4 + $1 = $5.

The cake is half the price of the bagel, so the cake costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add the costs of all items together: $4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much money Kenny has after selling the cards. We know he has $50 in spending cash and he plans to use the rest of the money to buy a ticket to the amusement park, which costs $100. 

Let's denote the number of cards Kenny starts with as 'x'. He sells the cards for $1.5 each, so the total amount of money he gets from selling the cards is 1.5x. He keeps 1/3 of the cards, so he sells 2/3 of the cards. 

Since he has $50 in spending cash, the amount of money he gets from selling the cards is $100 - $50 = $50. We can set up the equation 1.5x = 50 to represent this situation.

Now, we can solve for x: 
1.5x = 50
x = 50 / 1.5
x = 33.33

Since Kenny can't sell a fraction of a card, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can see that 33.33 is not a whole number, but we can still solve the equation to get an approximate answer.

x ≈ 33.33

However, since we can't have a fraction of a card, we can round down to 33 cards, but this would leave Kenny with $50 - 1.5 * 33 = $1.5, which is not enough to buy the ticket. 

So, Kenny must have had more than 33 cards. 

Let's try 34 cards:
1.5 * 34 = 51
x = 51 / 1.5
x = 34

This is a whole number, and Kenny can sell 34 cards to get $51, which is more than enough to buy the ticket. 

Therefore, Kenny started with 34 cards.

The final answer is 34."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of hotdogs the caterer prepared. Since the caterer prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs, we can calculate the total number of hotdogs as follows:

Total number of guests = 36
Number of guests who would have had two hotdogs = 36 / 2 = 18
Total number of hotdogs prepared = 18 * 2 = 36

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means the caterer had enough hotdogs for 40 guests to have two hotdogs. 

Since the caterer prepared 36 hotdogs, which is enough for 40 guests to have two hotdogs, we can calculate the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog as follows:

Number of guests who did not get a second hotdog = Total number of guests - Total number of hotdogs prepared
= 40 - 36
= 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we first need to find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Indras has 6 letters, so half of that is 6 / 2 = 3. 

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than that, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Now, we need to find the total number of letters in both names. 

The total number of letters is 6 (Indras) + 7 (sister) = 13.

The final answer is 13."
"To calculate the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items before the discount.

The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00.
The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00.
The cost of the 5 separate utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost of the items before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Since the items are 20% off, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
20% of $165.00 is 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final amount.
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

The final answer is: $132.00"
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and subtract the amount of money she already has.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of dragons each prince slew.

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, so he slew 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so he slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so he slew 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

Therefore, Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons.

"To find out how many gallons Josey needed, we first need to determine the amount of gas in each container. 

15 gallons were divided into 5 containers, so each container has 15 / 5 = 3 gallons.

Since Josey needed 1/4 of a container, we need to convert the fraction to a decimal. 1/4 is equal to 0.25. 

Now, we multiply the amount of gas in each container by the fraction Josey needed: 3 gallons * 0.25 = 0.75 gallons.

To convert gallons to pints, we know that 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints. So, we multiply 0.75 gallons by 8 pints per gallon: 0.75 * 8 = 6 pints.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George spent on chips. Since each bag of chips costs 40 cents and he bought 3 bags, the total cost of chips is 3 * 40 = 120 cents.

George started with $5, which is equivalent to 500 cents. After spending 120 cents on chips, he had 500 - 120 = 380 cents left. Since he had 1% of his money left, we can set up the equation:

1% of 500 = 5 cents

This means that 380 cents is 99% of the money he had initially. To find the total amount of money he had initially, we can set up the equation:

99% of x = 380

To solve for x, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:

0.99x = 380

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.99 to find x:

x = 380 / 0.99
x = 384.84

Since George started with $5, we can round down to the nearest dollar, as we can't have a fraction of a dollar. So, he initially had $5.

Now, we can find out how much money he spent on candy bars. We know that he spent $5 in total and $4.84 on chips. Therefore, he spent:

$5 - $4.84 = $0.16 on candy bars.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can divide the amount he spent on candy bars by the cost of each candy bar to find the number of candy bars he bought:

$0.16 / 0.75 = 0.21

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can see that 0.21 is less than 1, so he didn't buy any candy bars.

The final answer is: 0"
"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends.

First, we need to find out how many lollipops Ray shared with his friends. He had 25 lollipops initially and kept 5 for himself, so the number of lollipops he shared is:

25 - 5 = 20

Now, we divide the shared lollipops by the number of friends:

20 ÷ 4 = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the two pieces that Rory and her mom each have from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of the cake = 20 ounces
Number of pieces = 8
Number of people who have a piece = 2

Weight of the pieces = 20 / 8 = 2.5 ounces per piece

Weight of the two pieces = 2.5 * 2 = 5 ounces

Weight of the remaining cake = Weight of the cake - Weight of the two pieces
Weight of the remaining cake = 20 - 5
Weight of the remaining cake = 15 ounces

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"To find the total number of people sharing the oranges, we need to add Sitti and Juris to the 6 friends, which makes 8 people in total.

Now, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people. 

Total oranges = 34 (Sitti's oranges) + 22 (Juris's oranges) = 56 oranges

Number of people = 8

Oranges per person = Total oranges / Number of people = 56 / 8 = 7

Therefore, everyone will get 7 oranges."
"To find the total cost of the ingredients, we need to calculate the cost of the onions and the beef stock separately.

The cost of the onions: 
Antoine needs 2 pounds of onions, and they are on sale for $2.00 a pound. 
So, the total cost of the onions is 2 pounds * $2.00/pound = $4.00.

The cost of the beef stock: 
Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and they are on sale for $2.00 a box. 
So, the total cost of the beef stock is 2 boxes * $2.00/box = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $4.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $8.00.

Since Antoine's soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $8.00 / 6 servings = $1.33.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is $1."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Bernadette to arrive at the theater. 

Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, she should leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 21 minutes before Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we can convert 3 yards to feet by multiplying 3 by 3.

3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now that we have the length in feet, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:

Area = Length * Width
360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of Billie's room is 98 feet.

"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads each one bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Elizabeth has:
1 (red) + 2 * 20 (clear) = 1 + 40 = 41 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Margareth has:
3 (blue) + 4 * 20 (red) = 3 + 80 = 83 beads

Now, to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has:
83 (Margareth) - 41 (Elizabeth) = 42

The answer is 42."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the change in temperature due to the oven and the window.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour, and it is on for 3 hours. So, the total temperature increase due to the oven is 5 * 3 = 15 degrees.

Next, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the window. The window cools down the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes it is open, and it is open for 30 minutes. So, the total temperature decrease due to the window is 2 * (30/10) = 6 degrees.

Now, we need to add the temperature increase due to the oven and subtract the temperature decrease due to the window to find the final temperature. 

Final temperature = Initial temperature + Temperature increase due to oven - Temperature decrease due to window
Final temperature = 40 + 15 - 6
Final temperature = 49 degrees.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the time it took James to complete each segment of the triathlon.

Jon's swim time is 40 minutes. James finishes the swim 10% faster, so James' swim time is 40 - (40 * 0.10) = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

Jon's bike ride time is 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes. James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike, so James' bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Jon's run time is 50 minutes. We are given that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' run time must be 50 + 10 = 60 minutes.

Now, we can calculate James' total time by adding his times for each segment: 36 minutes (swim) + 85 minutes (bike) + 60 minutes (run) = 181 minutes.

The final answer is: 181"
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie C in minutes, since the question asks for the length of Movie A in minutes.

Movie C was 1.25 hours, and there are 60 minutes in an hour. 

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Now, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. 

75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

Since Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, we can divide the length of Movie B by 4 to find the length of Movie A.

80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

"To determine the total amount of hay the horse eats, we first need to calculate the distance the horse runs. 

Given that the horse runs at 32 miles per hour and for 30 minutes, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

30 minutes = 30/60 = 0.5 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance the horse runs:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs, and a bail of hay costs $3, the total cost of hay for 16 miles is:
Total cost of hay = 16 miles * 1/2 bail/mile * $3/bail
Total cost of hay = 16 * 1.5 * $3
Total cost of hay = $72

Michael has six 5-dollar bills, which is a total of:
Total money = 6 * $5
Total money = $30

To find the change, we subtract the total cost of hay from the total money:
Change = Total money - Total cost of hay
Change = $30 - $72
Change = -$42

Since the change is negative, it means Michael does not have enough money to buy the hay. He is short $42."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's denote the regular price of a popcorn as P and the regular price of a soda as S. 

The cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and a soda at regular price is 12 + P + S.

The cost of buying a super ticket is 20 + 1 (for the popcorn) = 21.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and a soda at regular price is $2 more than the cost of buying a super ticket. 

So, we can set up the equation: 12 + P + S = 21 + 2.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 12 + P + S = 23.

We know that the cost of a soda is $3, so S = 3.

Substituting S = 3 into the equation, we get: 12 + P + 3 = 23.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 15 + P = 23.

Subtracting 15 from both sides, we get: P = 8.

Therefore, the regular price of a popcorn is $8.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the original cost of filling one balloon. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as x. Since the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, we can set up the equation:

20x = 900

Dividing both sides by 20, we get:

x = 900 / 20
x = 45

So, the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost of filling one balloon is:

45 + 20 = 65

Now, we need to find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price. We can multiply the new cost of one balloon by 170:

65 * 170 = 11,100

Therefore, Bentley paid $11,100 to fill 170 balloons after the price increase."

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

The final answer is: 78"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. 

Twenty minutes later, half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. 
Half of 50 is 25, so 25 fairies joined from the east. 
Now, the total number of fairies is 50 (initial) + 25 (new) = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. 
So, the remaining number of fairies is 75 - 30 = 45.

The final answer is 45."
"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add the number of puppies from both Jennifer's and Brandon's dogs. 

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and 3 of them have spots. 
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, and 4 of them have spots.

Total number of puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we divide the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

The final answer is 35."
"To determine the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of each item and add them together.

- Two 1-pound boxes of sugar cubes weigh 2 pounds.
- Four 12-pound bags of carrots weigh 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.
- Forty-two 75-pound bales of hay weigh 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.
- Twenty 65-pound sacks of oats weigh 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

The total weight of the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3700 pounds.

To find out how many trips the farmer needs to make, we divide the total weight of the feed by the capacity of the truck (2250 pounds).

3700 / 2250 = 1.64

Since the farmer cannot make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her earnings per week and then multiply it by 4.

Grayson earns 2 cents for each aluminum can and 3 cents for each plastic bottle. She recycles 3 aluminum cans and 5 plastic bottles per week.

Earnings from aluminum cans per week: 3 cans * 2 cents = 6 cents
Earnings from plastic bottles per week: 5 bottles * 3 cents = 15 cents

Total earnings per week: 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents

Now, let's multiply her weekly earnings by 4 to find out her monthly earnings:
21 cents * 4 = 84 cents

The final answer is: 84"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, we can calculate Toni's plants as follows:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + 60% of Frederick's plants
Toni's plants = 10 + 0.6 * 10
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find out how many plants Shondra has. Since Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, we can calculate Shondra's plants as follows:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

The final answer is: 9"

Then, she moved ahead 2 spots, so she was in 4th place.
After that, she fell behind 3 spots, so she was in 7th place.
Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot, so she finished in 6th place.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many students Miss Maria has, we first need to calculate the total number of cards she has. 

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, so the total number of basketball cards is 6 * 25 = 150. 

She also has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200. 

The total number of cards Miss Maria has is 150 (basketball) + 200 (baseball) = 350 cards.

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is 350 - 50 = 300 cards.

Since each student gets 10 cards, the number of students can be found by dividing the total number of cards given to students by 10. 

Number of students = 300 / 10 = 30.

The final answer is 30."
"To find out how much Becky paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples she bought and subtract the discount she received. 

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each, so the total cost is 20 * 0.45 = $9. 

She received a $1 discount, so the amount she paid is 9 - 1 = $8.

To find out how much Kelly paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples she bought and subtract the discount she received. 

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each, so the total cost is 20 * 0.50 = $10.

She received a 10 percent discount, which is 0.10 * 10 = $1. 

The amount she paid is 10 - 1 = $9.

To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we subtract the amount Becky paid from the amount Kelly paid: 9 - 8 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry, we need to calculate the number of each item per room and then multiply by 80.

Each room has:
- 2 sheets
- 1 comforter
- Twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases
- Twice as many towels as pillow cases, so 2 * 4 = 8 towels

Now, let's calculate the total number of pieces per room:
2 sheets + 1 comforter + 4 pillow cases + 8 towels = 15 pieces per room

To find the total number of pieces in 80 rooms, we multiply the number of pieces per room by 80:
15 pieces/room * 80 rooms = 1200 pieces

The final answer is: 1200"
"To find the total number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday, we need to calculate the total number of shoes he has before Saturday and then subtract the shoes he gets rid of.

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes, which is 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.
On Wednesday, he gains 15 new pairs, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.
On Friday, he gains 30 new pairs, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.

Total shoes before Saturday = 10 + 30 + 60 = 100 shoes.

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes.

Total shoes on Sunday = Total shoes before Saturday - 180 = 100 - 180 = -80.

Since you cannot have a negative number of shoes, it's likely that the question contains an error. However, based on the calculation, the answer is -80."
"To determine the number of pans Mary should bake, we need to calculate the total number of cupcakes she can decorate with her sprinkles. 

Since each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and she has 6 jars, the total number of cupcakes she can decorate is 6 jars * 8 cupcakes/jar = 48 cupcakes.

Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, the number of pans needed is 48 cupcakes / 12 cupcakes/pan = 4 pans.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the cost of the piece of paper, we need to calculate three times the price of the pen, which is 3 * $2 = $6. Since the paper costs $1 less than this, the cost of the paper is $6 - $1 = $5.

"To find out how many pencils were left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pencils used in the first two months: 
   Total pencils initially = 30 * 10 = 300
   Pencils used in the first two months = 1/5 * 300 = 60

2. Calculate the remaining pencils after the first two months:
   Remaining pencils = Total pencils - Pencils used
                     = 300 - 60
                     = 240

3. Calculate the number of pencils left at the end of the year:
   Pencils left at the end of the year = 1/3 * Remaining pencils
                                     = 1/3 * 240
                                     = 80

Therefore, there are 80 pencils left.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. 

Since Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, and he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra, we can write the equation as:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras and then divide it by the length of the shark.

First, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, 6 inches is equal to 0.5 feet.

The total length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents:

(1 foot / 10 feet) * 100 = 10%

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

"To find the total number of students at that grade level, we need to first determine the number of students who have desktop computers. Since three-fourths of the students have desktop computers, we can represent this as 3/4 * total_students = students_with_computers.

We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers, so the number of students without computers is 1/4 of the total number of students. This can be represented as 1/4 * total_students = 20.

To find the total number of students, we can set up an equation:

1/4 * total_students = 20

To solve for total_students, we can multiply both sides by 4:

total_students = 20 * 4
total_students = 80

So, there are 80 students at that grade level.

80"
"To find out how long Jason needs to walk each day, we need to divide the total time it takes to break in the shoes (240 minutes) by the number of days he can walk per week (7 days).

First, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

Now, we can divide the total time in hours by the number of days:

4 hours / 7 days = 0.57 hours per day

To convert the result back to minutes, we can multiply by 60:

0.57 hours * 60 = 34.2 minutes per day

So, Jason needs to walk approximately 34.2 minutes per day for 7 days to break in the new shoes.

34.2"
"To find out how many books each child received, we need to first determine the total number of books Sarah bought. 

Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can divide the total amount spent by the cost per book to find the total number of books:

Total amount spent = $300
Cost per book = $15
Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost per book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by 4 to find out how many books each child received:

Number of books per child = Total number of books / 4
Number of books per child = 20 / 4
Number of books per child = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to first find the total number of kids who are allergic to at least one substance. 

We know that 9 kids are allergic to dairy, 6 are allergic to peanuts, and 3 are allergic to both. To avoid double-counting the kids allergic to both, we need to subtract the number of kids allergic to both from the sum of the kids allergic to dairy and peanuts.

Number of kids allergic to at least one substance = (Number of kids allergic to dairy) + (Number of kids allergic to peanuts) - (Number of kids allergic to both)
= 9 + 6 - 3
= 12

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything.

Number of kids not allergic to anything = Total number of kids - Number of kids allergic to at least one substance
= 32 - 12
= 20

Total number of people = 200 * 3
Total number of people = 600

The total number of people going on the tour is 600."
"To calculate the total cost of the trip, we need to first find the cost of the hotel for 3 days at the increased price.

The normal price of the hotel per day is $1500. Since the hotel is 20% more expensive for the busy weekend, we need to calculate the increased price.

20% of $1500 is 0.20 * $1500 = $300. 

So, the increased price of the hotel per day is $1500 + $300 = $1800.

For 3 days, the total cost of the hotel would be $1800 * 3 = $5400.

The cost of the plane tickets for 2 people is $5000 * 2 = $10000.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel: $10000 + $5400 = $15400.

"To find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to calculate the number of tubes of blue paint and yellow paint he has.

Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint. 

Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, so Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so Jasper has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

Therefore, Jasper has 2 tubes of blue paint and 9 tubes of yellow paint, for a total of 2 + 9 = 11 tubes of paint.

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to determine the weight of the 2010 penny. 

Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight as follows:

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * Weight of 1959 penny
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48 grains
Weight of 2010 penny = 36 grains

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their individual weights:

Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny
Combined weight = 48 grains + 36 grains
Combined weight = 84 grains

Stetson ate 2/5 of the oranges, and they picked 60 oranges. 

First, we need to find 2/5 of 60. 

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

Since Stetson gave up $10 for each orange, we multiply the number of oranges he ate by the amount he gave up per orange.

24 * 10 = 240

The total amount of money Stetson gave up is $240."
"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we need to first calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes. 

3 times the cost of her shoes is 3 * $80 = $240.

Since her handbag cost $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes, we subtract $20 from $240.

$240 - $20 = $220.

Therefore, Jillian's handbag cost $220.

The final answer is: $220."
"To find the total hours James runs per week, we need to calculate the total miles he runs in a week and then divide that by his speed.

Total miles run per week = miles run per day * days run per week
Total miles run per week = 12 miles/day * 5 days/week
Total miles run per week = 60 miles/week

Now, we can find the total hours run per week by dividing the total miles run per week by his speed:
Total hours run per week = Total miles run per week / speed
Total hours run per week = 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour
Total hours run per week = 6 hours/week

"To determine the total amount of oats needed, we first need to calculate the daily consumption of oats by all four horses. Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and they are fed twice a day. 

Daily consumption per horse = 5 pounds/meal * 2 meals = 10 pounds
Daily consumption for all horses = 10 pounds/horse * 4 horses = 40 pounds

Since Uncle Ben needs oats for five days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5:
Total oats needed for 5 days = 40 pounds/day * 5 days = 200 pounds

Now, we need to find out how many bags of oats are required. Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats. To find the number of bags needed, we divide the total amount of oats required by the weight of each bag:
Number of bags needed = Total oats needed / Weight per bag = 200 pounds / 50 pounds/bag = 4 bags

"To find the cost of each individual razor after the discount, we need to first calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors.

Since the razors come 4 to a pack, 2 packs will contain 8 razors. 

The original price of 2 packs is 2 * $4.00 = $8.00.

With the buy one get one free offer, the effective price of 2 packs is $4.00 (for the first pack) + $0 (for the second pack, since it's free).

Now, applying the $2.00 coupon, the total cost becomes $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 8 razors in 2 packs, the cost per razor is $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) plus $5 per guest for food, which is $5x. 

The cost of the second venue is $25 per guest, which is $25x.

To find the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we set the two expressions equal to each other:

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of insects each person found. 

Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found B/2 insects.

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found B/2 + 7 insects.

We also know that the total number of insects collected is 43. Therefore, the sum of the insects found by each person is equal to 43:

B + B/2 + B/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms:

2B + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2B = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

B = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found:

David found B/2 = 18/2 = 9 insects.

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found:

Lily found B/2 + 7 = 18/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 insects.

"To find the length of the couch, we need to first find the width of the rug. 

Since the chair is 3 feet wide and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, the rug's width is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. 

Adding 2 feet to this, we get the length of the couch: 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

The final answer is: 18"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total amount Suzie paid for the grape and green apple gum. 

She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum and half as much for a pack of green apple gum, which is $2 / 2 = $1. 

The total amount she paid for these two packs is $2 + $1 = $3. 

Since she paid $7 in total, the amount she paid for the strawberry gum is $7 - $3 = $4. 

Since she bought two packs of strawberry gum, the cost of each pack is $4 / 2 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks, Frederick should buy as many 2 x 8 pieces of wood as possible, since they provide more sticks per dollar. 

First, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces he can buy with $24: 
$24 / $6 = 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood.

Since each 2 x 8 piece provides 400 sticks, the total number of sticks from 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood is 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks.

Now, let's check if he has enough money to buy 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood: 
4 * $6 = $24, which is equal to his budget.

Since he can buy 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood, he can make 1600 popsicle sticks.

The final answer is 1600."
"To determine the total cost, we need to calculate the number of pairs of snowshoes required. Since each dog has four legs and each pair of snowshoes covers two legs, we can divide the total number of legs by 2 to find the number of pairs needed.

6 dogs * 4 legs per dog = 24 legs
24 legs / 2 legs per pair = 12 pairs

Now, we can multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair to find the total cost.

12 pairs * $12.00 per pair = $144.00

The total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $144.00."
"To calculate the weekly cost of bus trips without a pass, we need to multiply the cost of a single trip by the number of trips per week.

Cost per trip: $2.20
Trips per week: 5

Weekly cost without pass: $2.20 * 5 = $11.00

Since Janet buys a weekly pass for $20, we subtract the weekly cost without the pass from the cost of the pass to find the savings.

Weekly pass cost: $20
Weekly cost without pass: $11.00

Savings: $20 - $11.00 = $9.00

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first establish the number of cows and sheep in each location.

The farm has 30 cows. 
The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals in the farm and zoo combined. 
The total number of animals is 30 (farm cows) + 60 (zoo cows) + 10 (farm sheep) + 20 (zoo sheep) = 120.

"To determine the daily calorie deficit needed for Andy to reach his goal, we need to calculate the total number of days he has to lose weight and the total calories he needs to burn.

Andy's birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. Therefore, he has approximately 8 months and 20 days to lose weight.

First, we need to calculate the total number of days: 
August (31 days) + September (30 days) + October (31 days) + November (30 days) + December (31 days) + January (31 days) + February (28 or 29 days, depending on the year) + March (31 days) + April (30 days) + May (31 days) + June (30 days) + July (19 days) = 308 days

Since Andy needs to lose 30 lbs, and he needs to burn 3500 calories per pound, the total calories he needs to burn is 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To calculate the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed to burn by the number of days:
105,000 calories / 308 days ≈ 340 calories per day

Therefore, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of approximately 340 calories to reach his goal."
"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate how much he earned in a week and subtract the amount he spent.

Gerald earns $30 per day. There are 7 days in a week, so he earns $30 * 7 = $210 in a week.

He spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount spent from the amount earned: $210 - $100 = $110.

"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on clothes: 
20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount:
$500 - $100 = $400

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on CDs:
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount:
$400 - $100 = $300

So, Julie had $300 left.

"To find the cost of the house, we need to divide the total cost by 4, since the house costs three times as much as the lot. 

Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x. The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:

4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 30,000

Since the cost of the house is 3x, we multiply x by 3:

Cost of the house = 3 * 30,000 = 90,000

The house cost $90,000."
"To find the total cost of the bags, we need to multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 
8 packs * $4 per pack = $32

Tara sold each bag for $8. To find the total revenue, we multiply the number of bags by the selling price per bag:
8 bags * $8 per bag = $64

Now, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit:
$64 - $32 = $32

"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to first determine how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can calculate Josh's cookies as follows:

Josh's cookies = Suzanne's cookies / 4
Josh's cookies = 36 / 4
Josh's cookies = 9

Now that we know Josh made 9 cookies, and Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total amount of money Ali has. 

Ali has 4 $10 bills, which is 4 * $10 = $40. He also has 6 $20 bills, which is 6 * $20 = $120. The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives his sister half of the total money, which is $160 / 2 = $80. So, he is left with $160 - $80 = $80.

Then, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. 3/5 of $80 is (3/5) * $80 = $48. 

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Rob to shingle a house in minutes. 

Since Rob takes 2 hours, we need to convert this to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 hours is equal to 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. So, we need to find double the time it takes Rob, which is 2 * 120 = 240 minutes. 

Then, we add 40 minutes to this result, which gives us 240 + 40 = 280 minutes.

Therefore, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house.

"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour, we need to calculate the individual rates of each person and then add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.
Kathy picks twice as many quarts per hour as Bobby, so Kathy picks 5 * 2 = 10 quarts per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, so Ricky picks 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, we add the individual rates together to find the total number of quarts per hour: 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29.

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we first need to calculate her current weekly consumption and the new total consumption after adding the device.

Current daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
Current weekly consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatt-hours per week
Current weekly bill: 84 kilowatt-hours per week * $1.50 per kilowatt-hour = $126 per week

New daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour
New weekly consumption: 14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatt-hours per week
New weekly bill: 98 kilowatt-hours per week * $1.50 per kilowatt-hour = $147 per week

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $147 - $126 = $21."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the rate at which one person paints the house. Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can calculate the rate as follows:

Rate = 1 house / 5 days = 1/5 house per day

Since we want to know how many days it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we can divide the total work (1 house) by the combined rate of 5 people:

Combined rate = 5 people * (1/5 house per day) = 1 house per day

Now, we can divide the total work (1 house) by the combined rate (1 house per day):

Time = 1 house / 1 house per day = 1 day

However, since we want to know the time in hours, we need to convert the days to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so:

Time (hours) = 1 day * 24 hours/day = 24 hours

Therefore, it would take 5 people 24 hours to paint a whole house.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many chairs Ophelia has. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, and Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can set up an equation to find the number of chairs Ophelia has.

Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as 'x'. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna has 3x chairs. We are also given that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, we can set up the equation:

20 = x - 2

Solving for x, we get:
x = 20 + 2
x = 22

Now that we know Ophelia has 22 chairs, we can find the number of chairs Jenna has:
Jenna's chairs = 3 * 22
Jenna's chairs = 66

Now, we can find the total number of sofas and chairs:
Total = Ophelia's sofas + Ophelia's chairs + Jenna's chairs
Total = 20 + 22 + 66
Total = 108

Total hours for these weeks = 6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 24 hours

For the weeks he worked out 5 hours a week, there are 2 weeks.
Total hours for these weeks = 2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours

Additionally, there was one week where he worked out 6 hours.
Total hours for this week = 6 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, leaving 48 - 8 = 40 passengers.

5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get on the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. So, 40 more passengers get on, making the total 40 + 40 = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, leaving 80 - 21 = 59 passengers.

3 times fewer passengers get on the bus, which means 1/3 of the number of passengers who got off (21) get on. So, 21 / 3 = 7 passengers get on. The total number of passengers after the second stop is 59 + 7 = 66.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jame's current age be x.

In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5) + 5 = x + 10 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 10 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 10 = 2x + 5

Subtracting x from both sides:

10 = x + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

5 = x

So, Jame's current age is 5 years.

Now, let's find Jame's cousin's current age. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be x + 10 = 5 + 10 = 15 years old.

The age difference between Jame and his cousin is 15 - 5 = 10 years.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we first need to determine the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can calculate the cost of the printer as follows:

Cost of printer = Cost of computer - $400
Cost of printer = $1,100 - $400
Cost of printer = $700

Now that we know the cost of the printer, we can find the total cost of the computer and printer:
Total cost of computer and printer = $1,100 + $700
Total cost of computer and printer = $1,800

Since Errol bought 2 monitors, we can find the cost of one monitor by dividing the total cost of the computer and printer by 2:

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the girls brought 60 + 4 * 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 shells.

Now, we need to divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by the number of girls. Since the girls are divided into two equal groups, the number of girls is half of 20, which is 10.

Number of seashells brought by each girl = Total number of seashells brought by girls / Number of girls

First, we know Elvis has a monthly target of $1125. Since there are 30 days in April, we can divide the total target by 30 to find the daily savings needed for the first half of the month.

Daily savings for the first half of the month = $1125 / 15 (15 days in the first half of April) = $75

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, we can multiply the daily savings for the first half by 2.

Daily savings for the second half of the month = $75 * 2 = $150

Therefore, Elvis needs to save $150 per day in the second half of the month to hit his target."

Since James's play set has 80 toys, a set five times larger would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys. 

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than this, so he needs 400 + 2 = 402 toys. 

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 402 - 2 = 400 toys.

"To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The cost of 5 notebooks is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50
The cost of 2 pens is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
The cost of 1 calculator is $12
The cost of 1 geometry set is $10

The total cost of all items is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $20

To apply the 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of the total cost, which is 0.10 * $20 = $2

The final cost after the discount is $20 - $2 = $18

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total cost of the items Carly ordered, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of hamburgers: 5 hamburgers * $4 each = $20

"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down her commission into two parts: the commission for sales up to $1000 and the additional commission for sales over $1000.

For sales up to $1000, her commission is 30% of $1000, which is 0.3 * $1000 = $300.

For sales over $1000, her commission is 10% of the amount over $1000, which is 0.1 * ($2500 - $1000) = 0.1 * $1500 = $150.

Now, we add the two commissions together to find Antonella's total earnings: $300 + $150 = $450.

The final answer is: $450"
"To determine the total number of water bottles Bill needs, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles he already has. Since he has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each, the total number of bottles he has is 2 * 24 = 48.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he needs for his guests. He has 70 guests and wants 2 bottles for each guest, so the total number of bottles needed is 70 * 2 = 140.

To find out how many additional bottles Bill needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles needed: 140 - 48 = 92.

Therefore, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water for his party.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Ray to swim 3 miles on both a cold day and a hot day.

On a cold day, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. To find the time it takes to swim 3 miles, we multiply the time it takes to swim 1 mile by 3: 16 minutes * 3 = 48 minutes.

On a hot day, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. First, we find the time it takes to swim 1 mile on a hot day: 2 * 16 minutes = 32 minutes. Then, we add 2 minutes to this time: 32 minutes + 2 minutes = 34 minutes. To find the time it takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day, we multiply the time it takes to swim 1 mile by 3: 34 minutes * 3 = 102 minutes.

Now, we subtract the time it takes to swim 3 miles on a cold day from the time it takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day to find the difference: 102 minutes - 48 minutes = 54 minutes.

"To find the total number of holes in the bag, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the number of holes in the buttons with four holes.

There are 7 buttons with two holes, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 * 2 = 14.

The rest of the buttons are 21 - 7 = 14 buttons, and each of these buttons has 4 holes. So, the total number of holes in these buttons is 14 * 4 = 56.

To find the total number of holes in the bag, we add the number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the number of holes in the buttons with four holes: 14 + 56 = 70.

Therefore, there are 70 holes in all the buttons in the bag.

"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can calculate it by dividing Timothy's locker size by 2.

Zack's locker size = Timothy's locker size / 2
Zack's locker size = 24 / 2
Zack's locker size = 12 cubic inches

Now, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To find Peter's locker size, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 1/4.

Peter's locker size = Zack's locker size * 1/4
Peter's locker size = 12 * 1/4
Peter's locker size = 3 cubic inches

The final answer is 3."
"To find out how many cups Juan drinks, we need to multiply the amount Octavia drinks by 10. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, she drinks 0.5 cups. 

Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks, so Juan drinks 0.5 * 10 = 5 cups.

The doctor has asked Juan to reduce his intake to 4 cups. To find out how many cups Juan must reduce, we subtract the recommended amount from the amount he currently drinks: 5 - 4 = 1 cup.

The final answer is 1."
"To find the total number of rodents, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, so the total number of hamsters is 3 x 10 = 30.

There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so the total number of guinea pigs is 3 x 5 = 15.

Now, we add the total number of hamsters and guinea pigs together: 30 + 15 = 45.

Therefore, the pet shop had 45 rodents in total.

"To find the average weight of the three friends, we need to first find their individual weights.

Mark weighs 150 pounds.
Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.
Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we can find the average weight by adding their weights and dividing by 3:
(150 + 130 + 260) / 3 = 540 / 3 = 180

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the change in the angle of the sun relative to the ground over the 10-hour period.

The initial angle of the sun relative to the ground is 32 degrees. The sun is moving upward at a rate of 5 degrees per hour. 

The change in angle over 10 hours is 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees.

Since the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, the initial angle is 90 degrees (perpendicular to the ground). After 10 hours, the angle will be 90 - 32 + 50 = 108 degrees.

The final answer is: 108"
"To determine the total cost of the candles, we need to first find out how many packs James needs to buy. 

Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Since the number of candles per pack is 5, we can divide the number of sons by 5 to find out how many packs James needs to buy. 

12 (older son) / 5 = 2.4 (round up to 3 packs since we can't buy a fraction of a pack)
8 (younger son) / 5 = 1.6 (round up to 2 packs since we can't buy a fraction of a pack)

So, James needs to buy 3 packs of candles for the older son and 2 packs for the younger son. 

3 packs * $3 per pack = $9
2 packs * $3 per pack = $6

Total cost = $9 + $6 = $15

The final answer is 15."
"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she spent reading in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Now, we know that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes, we can divide 105 by 1.5 to get the number of 1.5-minute intervals, which is 70. Then, we multiply this number by 2 to get the total number of pages she read in the first week, which is 70 * 2 = 140 pages.

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week (140) and the pages read in the second week (100), which is 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

"To find out how many sandwiches are left, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor.

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which is 1/3 of 12. 
1/3 of 12 is 4 sandwiches.

Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which is 1/4 of 12. 
1/4 of 12 is 3 sandwiches.

The total number of sandwiches eaten is 4 + 3 = 7.

To find the number of sandwiches left, we subtract the total eaten from the original amount: 
12 - 7 = 5

There are 5 sandwiches left."
"To solve this problem, let's denote Shiloh's current age as S and his nephew's current age as N. 

We are given that Shiloh is 44 years old today, so S = 44.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be S + 7, and his nephew's age will be N + 7. According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This can be written as:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44 into the equation:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

10 = N

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth were worth $1.00 each, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. So, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

"To find out how many goals each teenager scored, we need to start with the information that Richie scored 80 goals. 

Since Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can find Mark's goals by subtracting 20 from Richie's total: 80 - 20 = 60 goals for Mark.

We also know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. To find Anna's goals, we subtract 45 from Richie's total: 80 - 45 = 35 goals for Anna.

Now, we have the number of goals scored by each teenager: Richie (80), Mark (60), and Anna (35).

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add their goals together: 80 + 60 + 35 = 175.

Total amount Mitchell made = 21 * $4
Total amount Mitchell made = $84

Now, we need to find out how much more Mitchell made than Liam. 

Liam's earnings = $63
Mitchell's earnings = $84

Difference in earnings = Mitchell's earnings - Liam's earnings
Difference in earnings = $84 - $63

"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate the number of action figures he bought each day and then add them up.

Peter has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week. Since there are 7 days in a week, he will spend $10 per day.

From Sunday to Wednesday, he buys wooden action figures which cost $5 each. So, he buys 3 wooden action figures per day. 
3 * 5 = 15 wooden action figures

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he buys plastic action figures which cost $2 each. So, he buys 10 plastic action figures per day.
10 * 5 = 50 plastic action figures

Now, let's add the total number of action figures:
15 (wooden) + 50 (plastic) = 65 action figures

Peter will have 65 action figures by the end of the week.

"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses required by the shops per month and subtract the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses required by the shops per week:
20 (first shop) + 15 (second shop) + 30 (third shop) = 65 roses per week.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses required by the shops per month is:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month.

Now, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows from the total number of roses required:
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month.

Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To find the amount of money remaining in Katina's account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes from the account in that time period.

Since Katina removes $100 from the account every month, the total amount removed in a year is $100 * 12 = $1200.

In 2 years, the total amount removed is $1200 * 2 = $2400.

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the account:

$3000 - $2400 = $600

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her account.

"To find the correct temperature, we need to calculate the percentage difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature. 

The actual temperature is 468, and the set temperature is 450. The difference is 18 degrees. 

To find the percentage difference, we divide the difference by the set temperature and multiply by 100: 
(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Since the oven is off by the same percentage for any recipe, we need to find the temperature that is 4% higher than the actual temperature. 

To do this, we multiply the actual temperature by 1.04 (1 + 0.04): 
468 * 1.04 = 485.92

So, Maggie should set the oven to approximately 486 degrees.

"To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, we can convert this to minutes by adding 30 minutes to 60 minutes, resulting in 90 minutes.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. We can convert the 2 hours to minutes by multiplying 2 by 60, which equals 120 minutes. Then, we add the 5 minutes to get a total of 125 minutes.

Now, we add the time of the first movie (90 minutes) to the time of the second movie (125 minutes) to get the total time: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

Juan's house value is $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.

The combined value of the two houses is $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200."
"To find the total number of utensils brought by Judy and her friend, we need to first determine the number of cups and dishes Judy brought.

Judy bought a dozen (12) cups. Since she brought twice as many dishes as cups, she brought 12 * 2 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups brought by Judy and her friend is 12 + 40 = 52 cups.

The total number of dishes brought by Judy and her friend is 24 + 44 = 68 dishes.

The total number of utensils brought by the two is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120.

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we first need to calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts. 

Since each box is $100.00 and there's a 10% discount, the discounted price of one box is:
$100.00 * (1 - 0.10) = $90.00

The total cost of 2 boxes is:
$90.00 * 2 = $180.00

Since 90 single-use contacts last 45 days, we can calculate the number of days one pair of contacts will last:
90 contacts / 2 = 45 days per pair

Now, to find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the number of pairs:
$180.00 / 45 days per pair = $4.00 per pair

"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate their individual hours worked and multiply it by the hourly wage.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. 
Her earnings would be 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. 
He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. 
His total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours. 
His earnings would be 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

"To determine the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories she burns from both activities.

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour, so the total calories burned from aerobics is 2 * 500 = 1000 calories.

She also spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour, so the total calories burned from running is 1 * 600 = 600 calories.

The total calories burned is the sum of calories burned from aerobics and running, which is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we can divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times she needs to drink 100 ml of water.

1600 / 200 = 8

So, Hannah needs to drink 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml of water."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We are given that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation: B + R + G = 4500.

We are also given that the jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as: R = 0.99B.

Additionally, the jar contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as: G = 1.01B.

Substituting the expressions for R and G into the first equation, we get: B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500.

Combine like terms: 3B = 4500.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 1500.

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans: R = 0.99B = 0.99(1500) = 1485.

Finally, we can find the number of green jelly beans: G = 1.01B = 1.01(1500) = 1509.

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans: 1509 - 1485 = 24.

Now, we add the initial 100 guests, the 200 additional guests from the initial invitations, and the 18 additional guests from the 10 friends, and the 8 spouses. 

Total number of guests = 100 + 200 + 10 + 8 = 318.

Therefore, Alex will need 318 seats for the event.

"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to calculate the weights of the other dogs first.

The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"To determine the total cost of the boots on eBay, we need to calculate the shipping cost first. Since the shipping cost on eBay is twice as much as on Amazon, and the shipping cost on Amazon is $4, the shipping cost on eBay would be $4 * 2 = $8.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the boots on eBay by adding the cost of the boots and the shipping cost: $13 (boots) + $8 (shipping) = $21.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we subtract the cost of the boots on Amazon from the total cost on eBay: $21 (eBay) - $16 (Amazon) = $5.

The boots are $5 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, which is 20 feet off the ground. 

The beanstalk starts out 4 feet tall and doubles its height every day. 

Day 1: 4 feet * 2 = 8 feet
Day 2: 8 feet * 2 = 16 feet

"To find the total grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first calculate the grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day and each cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams, we can calculate the grams of protein per day as follows:

200 grams of mushrooms * 3 grams of protein per cup = 600 grams of protein per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to get the weekly protein intake:

600 grams of protein per day * 7 days per week = 4200 grams of protein per week

The final answer is: 4200"
"To solve this problem, let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. 

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation: x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides, we get: 0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get: 10 = x

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 10 + 3 = 13

The final answer is 13."
"To determine how many hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. 

The base price of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. Adding the extra cost of the porcelain crown for one of the implants, the total cost becomes $4000 + $500 = $4500. 

Since George has already put down a deposit of $600, the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Now, we can calculate the number of hours George needs to work to earn $3900 at $15 per hour. 

Number of hours = Total amount / Hourly wage
= $3900 / $15
= 260 hours

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the smallest angle as 'x'. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is 2x. The third angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is 3x.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

2x = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees
3x = 3 * 30 = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

He has 8 quarters, which is 8 * 25 = 200 cents.
He has 6 dimes, which is 6 * 10 = 60 cents.
He has 14 nickels, which is 14 * 5 = 70 cents.
He has 15 pennies, which is 15 * 1 = 15 cents.

Adding these amounts together, we get 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents.

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money Colby has by the cost of a gumball to find out how many he can buy: 345 / 5 = 69.

Therefore, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and then add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

The total number of legs in the store is 48."
"To find the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds. 

50% of 8 pounds = 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds

So, the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50% is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

Since Jamaal uses a weight two pounds lighter than the increased weight, we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds.

12 - 2 = 10 pounds

The weight Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds."
"To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he buys each year and add the 5 games he receives for Christmas.

Year 1: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday and 5 games from his parents, so he has 5 + 5 = 10 games.
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so he buys 12 games.
- Total games at the end of Year 1: 10 + 12 = 22 games.

Year 2: 
- He already has 22 games from the previous year.
- He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so he buys 24 games.
- Total games at the end of Year 2: 22 + 24 = 46 games.
- He gets 5 games for Christmas, so he now has 46 + 5 = 51 games.

Year 3: 
- He already has 51 games from the previous year.
- He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, so he buys 48 games.
- Total games at the end of Year 3: 51 + 48 = 99 games.
- He gets 5 games for Christmas, so he now has 99 + 5 = 104 games.

"To find the rate at which the plane is traveling, we need to divide the distance traveled by the time taken. 

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we can use this rate to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it would take the plane 5 additional hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

"To find the amount of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to calculate 3/4 of the amount Ruiz makes in two hours. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so in 1 hour, he makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds. 

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds as Ruiz in an hour, so she makes 3/4 * 60 = 45 pounds in an hour.

Now, if they worked for 12 hours in a day, Ruiz would make 60 * 12 = 720 pounds, and Marissa would make 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

"To find out how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from his original amount.

On Monday, Howard spent $8.

On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, so he spent 2 * $8 = $16.

On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, so he spent 4 * $16 = $64.

The total amount he spent is $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

He originally had $100, so the amount of money he has left is $100 - $88 = $12.

"To find the total amount of money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the earnings from the first four hours and the next two hours separately and then add them together.

For the first four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup. 
15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50/hour
$7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30

For the next two hours, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.60 per cup.
10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6/hour
$6/hour * 2 hours = $12

Total earnings = $30 + $12 = $42

"To determine the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to calculate the total number of rotations the tire will undergo in a year and then divide that by the number of rotations it can withstand.

First, we need to find the total number of rotations per year. Since Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, and the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, we can calculate the total rotations per mile as follows:

725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile

Now, we can multiply this by the total miles driven per year (400 miles/month * 12 months/year = 4800 miles/year):

362.5 rotations/mile * 4800 miles/year = 1,740,000 rotations/year

Now, we can divide the total number of rotations the tire can withstand (10,440,000) by the number of rotations it will undergo in a year (1,740,000):

10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years

Therefore, the tire will need to be replaced in approximately 6 years.

"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of washings Jackie will get from 1 pump. 

Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings.

Now, we need to find the cost of 60 washings. The total cost of 120 washings is $24.00. 

Cost per washing = Total cost / Total number of washings
Cost per washing = $24.00 / 120
Cost per washing = $0.20

Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost of 1 pump = Cost per washing * Number of washings per pump
Cost per pump = $0.20 * 60
Cost per pump = $12.00

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100.
Cost per pump (in cents) = $12.00 * 100
Cost per pump (in cents) = 1200 cents

The final answer is: 1200"
"To find out how much Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then subtract that from his initial $50.

First, we calculate the discount on the shirt: 30% of $25 is 0.3 * $25 = $7.50. The discounted price of the shirt is $25 - $7.50 = $17.50.

Next, we add the discounted price of the shirt to the price of the shorts: $17.50 + $35 = $52.50.

Since sales tax is included, we need to calculate the sales tax on the total cost of the items. The sales tax rate is not specified, but we can assume a standard sales tax rate of 8% for this example. The sales tax on the total cost is 0.08 * $52.50 = $4.20.

Now, we subtract the sales tax from the total cost: $52.50 - $4.20 = $48.30.

Finally, we subtract the total cost from Joe's initial $50: $50 - $48.30 = $1.70.

Joe will have $1.70 left after the purchase."
"To determine the amount of butter needed, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants Juan wants to make in a week. 

Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day, and there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 4 dozen by 7 days:

4 dozen * 7 days = 28 dozen croissants

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can convert 28 dozen to the total number of croissants:

28 dozen * 12 = 336 croissants

Now, we know that it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find the total amount of butter needed for 336 croissants, we multiply the number of croissants by the amount of butter needed per dozen:

336 croissants * 1/4 pound/croissant = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

Therefore, Juan will need 84 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months.

For the first 5 months, John received $100,000 per month. So, the total cost for these months is:

5 months * $100,000/month = $500,000

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the funding for the 6th month was $150,000, for the 7th month was $225,000, for the 8th month was $337.50, for the 9th month was $506.25, and for the 10th month was $765.625.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the remaining 5 months:

$150,000 + $225,000 + $337.50 + $506.25 + $765.625 = $2,244.375

Now, we add the cost of the first 5 months and the cost of the remaining 5 months:

$500,000 + $2,244.375 = $502,244.375

So, the total cost of John's research was $502,244.375."
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to calculate the ounces of meat each player consumed.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak. 
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce in size, so the total ounces of beef tips consumed is 8 ounces.
The third player ate a 1-pound steak, which is equal to 16 ounces.

Since the fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, they did not consume any meat.

Now, let's add up the ounces of meat consumed by the team:
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

The total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

"To determine the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks, we need to calculate its height at the end of each week.

At the end of the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.

At the end of the second week, it doubled in height, so it became 3 * 2 = 6 inches tall.

At the end of the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so its total height became 6 + 4 = 10 inches.

Therefore, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 weeks.

"To determine the number of days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to calculate the total amount of meat he sells in a day and then divide the total weight of the bull by that amount.

Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, so the total amount of meat he sells in a day is 15kg/hour * 10 hours = 150kg.

Now, we divide the total weight of the bull (750kg) by the amount of meat Prince sells in a day (150kg) to find the number of days it will take him to sell the meat:

750kg / 150kg/day = 5 days

"To find the total number of seats in the auditorium, we need to multiply the number of rows by the number of seats per row. 

Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

Since one-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators, the number of seats occupied by administrators = 1/4 * 72 = 18 seats

The remaining seats after removing the seats occupied by administrators = 72 - 18 = 54 seats

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents, so the number of seats occupied by parents = 1/3 * 54 = 18 seats

The number of seats occupied by students = 54 - 18 = 36 seats

Therefore, there were 36 students in the school auditorium.

"To calculate the total number of functioning street lights, we need to first find the total number of street lights at all intersections. 

Since each intersection has 4 street lights and there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is 4 * 4 = 16.

However, 20 street lights are not functioning. To find the number of functioning street lights, we subtract the non-functioning ones from the total number of street lights: 16 - 20 = -4. 

Since we cannot have a negative number of functioning street lights, this indicates an error in the initial calculation. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

The correct calculation should be: 4 intersections * 4 street lights per intersection = 16 street lights. However, we are told that 20 street lights are not working, which is more than the total number of street lights. This is an impossible scenario, as there can't be more non-functioning street lights than the total number of street lights.

Given the information provided, it's not possible to accurately calculate the number of functioning street lights, as the initial premise is flawed."

"To determine the total number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to calculate the number of pieces he chews throughout the day and subtract that from the initial 20 pieces.

Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

On the way home from school, he chews 1 piece of gum. 

After dinner, he chews 1 piece of gum.

So, in total, Jim chews 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces of gum throughout the day.

Now, we subtract the total number of pieces chewed from the initial 20 pieces: 20 - 6 = 14.

However, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 7, so he gives 7 pieces to his sister.

Therefore, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb per second to Mb per second. 

Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can divide her speed by 1000 to get her speed in Mb per second. 

20 kb/second ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb/second

Now, to find her speed in Mb per hour, we need to multiply her speed in Mb per second by the number of seconds in an hour. 

There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour. 

0.02 Mb/second * 3600 seconds = 72 Mb/hour

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to calculate the difference between the required height (4 feet) and his current height (40 inches). 

First, convert the required height to inches: 4 feet = 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, subtract Adam's current height from the required height: 48 - 40 = 8 inches.

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we can divide the difference by his growth rate to find the number of years it will take for him to reach the required height: 8 / 2 = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To find the number of riders who can stay upright on the wave, we first need to find the total number of riders who can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. 

Given that 25% of the riders can stay upright, and there are 100 riders, we can calculate this as follows:

25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders

Since 60% of these riders are women, we can find the number of women who can stay upright by calculating 60% of 25:

60% of 25 = 0.6 * 25 = 15 women

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

25 (total riders who can stay upright) - 15 (women) = 10 men

Therefore, 10 men can stay upright on the wave.

"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to first find the prices of the gold and silver jewels.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can find the price of the gold jewel. Since the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate it as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

Now, we know that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold. So, we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we have the prices of all three jewels: diamond ($2000), gold ($1600), and silver ($1200). To find the total price, we add the prices of all three jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond + Price of gold + Price of silver
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

We know that Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

Now, we can find the total number of stamps Max bought by adding the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps together: 16 + 19 + 10 = 45.

The final answer is 45."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the relative speed between Bob and Tom. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed to get the relative speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph
Relative speed = -15 mph

However, since speed cannot be negative, we take the absolute value of the relative speed.

Relative speed = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Relative speed

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate Darren's catch as follows:

Naomi's catch - 6 = Darren's catch
17 - 6 = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can find out how many fish Tommy caught. Since Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, we can calculate Tommy's catch as follows:

Darren's catch + 3 = Tommy's catch
11 + 3 = 14

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the total cost of the classes and then subtract the maximum amount they are willing to pay ($10 per class) from it.

Total cost of classes = Number of classes * Cost per class
Total cost of classes = 10 * $60
Total cost of classes = $600

Since Manny's parents won't sign him up again if the cost exceeds $10 per class, we need to find out how many classes he can miss before the total cost exceeds $600 - $10 * 10 = $580.

Let's assume Manny misses 'x' classes. The total cost after missing 'x' classes would be:
$600 - $10x

Since the total cost should not exceed $580, we can set up the inequality:
$600 - $10x ≤ $580
$10x ≥ $20
x ≥ 2

So, Manny can miss 2 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

"To find the total weekly production, we first need to determine the number of customers each person processes per day. 

Since Jewel processes 50 customers per day, and Julie processes twice as fast, Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day.

The total number of customers processed per day is 50 (by Jewel) + 100 (by Julie) = 150 customers per day.

Since they work all 7 days of the week, the total weekly production is 150 customers/day * 7 days/week = 1050 customers/week.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

We know that Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

We also know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. To find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to subtract 3 miles from Reggie's distance. 

So, Lynn's distance = Reggie's distance - 3 miles
= 20 miles - 3 miles

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges separately and then add them together.

The cost of 5 apples is 5 x $5.20 = $26.00.
The cost of 5 oranges is 5 x $3.30 = $16.50.

Now, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges: $26.00 + $16.50 = $42.50.

Clyde will pay $42.50 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we multiply the volume by 3 to find the total time.

Total time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Total time = 72 * 3
Total time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole."
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price of the truck.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade is $7,500.

Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, we add the cost of each feature to the base price of the truck:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab upgrade) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000
$42,000 + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To calculate Tim's new monthly salary, we need to first calculate the raise amount and the bonus amount.

The raise amount is 5% of his current salary: 
$20000 * 0.05 = $1000

The bonus is half a month's salary: 
$20000 / 12 = $1666.67 (approximately)

Now, we add the raise and the bonus to his current salary to get his new monthly salary:
$20000 + $1000 + $1666.67 = $21666.67

To calculate his yearly salary, we multiply his new monthly salary by 12:
$21666.67 * 12 = $26000

The final answer is: $26000"

The cost of dress shirts: 10 shirts * $60 per shirt = $600

Now, let's add the costs together: $7,500 + $1,500 + $600 = $9,600

The total cost of everything is $9,600."
"To calculate the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to calculate the total number of articles published by each website separately and then add them together.

The news website publishes 20 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. So, the total number of articles published by the news website in February is:

20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles

The sister company publishes 10 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. So, the total number of articles published by the sister company in February is:

10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles

Now, we add the total number of articles published by both websites to get the overall total:

560 articles + 280 articles = 840 articles

The total number of articles published by both websites in February is 840."

"To find the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we need to multiply the number of portions in one bag by the number of bags.

Since each bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, the total amount of flour in one bag is 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms.

Since there are three bags, the total amount of flour in three bags is 3 * 16 = 48 kilograms.

"To find the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked separately and then add them together.

Alisa biked at 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours, so her total distance is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 12 miles/hour * 4.5 hours
Distance = 54 miles

Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours, so his total distance is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 2.5 hours
Distance = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances biked by Alisa and Stanley to find the total distance:
Total Distance = Alisa's Distance + Stanley's Distance
Total Distance = 54 miles + 25 miles
Total Distance = 79 miles

The total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles.

"To determine the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay.

Time to dig through soil: 
Distance of soil = 24 feet
Rate of digging through soil = 4 feet/hour
Time to dig through soil = Distance / Rate = 24 / 4 = 6 hours

Time to dig through clay:
Distance of clay = 8 feet
Rate of digging through clay = 4 / 2 = 2 feet/hour (since he digs half as fast through clay)
Time to dig through clay = Distance / Rate = 8 / 2 = 4 hours

Total time to dig the well = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours

The total time it will take Bill to dig the well is 10 hours."
"To determine the total number of cupcakes Howie should buy, we need to calculate the total number of people, including himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates.

Total number of people = Howie + his teacher + 25 classmates
Total number of people = 1 (Howie) + 1 (teacher) + 25 (classmates)
Total number of people = 27

Since Howie wants to get 2 cupcakes for each person, we multiply the total number of people by 2.

Total cupcakes = Total number of people * 2
Total cupcakes = 27 * 2
Total cupcakes = 54

"To find the initial number of likes, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the initial number of likes as x. 

Since the number of likes after three weeks is 70 times the initial number of likes, we can write the equation as follows:

x + 2000 + 20000 = 70x

Combine like terms:

20000 + 2000 = 70x - x
22000 = 69x

Now, divide both sides by 69:

x = 22000 / 69
x = 319.45

Since the number of likes must be a whole number, we can round down to 319.

Now, we can find the total number of likes by adding the initial number of likes to the new likes:

Total likes = 319 + 20000
Total likes = 20119

The final answer is: 20119"
"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on both days.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. However, she got a $2 discount, so the total cost was 20 * $20 - $2 = $398.

On the next day, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each, but the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. The total cost before the discount was 20 * $30 = $600. The discount amount was 10% of $600, which is 0.1 * $600 = $60. So, the final cost for Sheila was $600 - $60 = $540.

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $540 - $398 = $142.

"To find the total amount Ariadne made in the first month, we need to determine the sales of green hats. 

Let's denote the sales of green hats as G. Since the sales of red hats were $400 and were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, we can set up the equation:

400 = 0.5G

To find G, we multiply both sides by 2:

G = 400 * 2
G = 800

So, the sales of green hats in the first month were $800.

Now, to find the total sales in the first month, we add the sales of red and green hats:

Total sales in the first month = 400 + 800
Total sales in the first month = 1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. 

Total sales in the second month = 3/4 * 1200
Total sales in the second month = 900

The total amount she made in two months is the sum of the sales in both months:

Total sales in two months = 1200 + 900
Total sales in two months = 2100

The final answer is: 2100"

"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to subtract the amount she has in her bank account from her expected wage.

Expected wage: $300
Current bank balance: $420

Withheld amount = Expected wage - Current bank balance
Withheld amount = $300 - $420
Withheld amount = -$120

Since the withheld amount cannot be negative, we need to consider the initial deposit and the current balance. 

Initial deposit: $200
Current balance: $420

Total amount in the account = Initial deposit + Current balance
Total amount in the account = $200 + $420
Total amount in the account = $620

Since Sally's expected wage is $300, the amount withheld from her wage is the difference between the total amount in the account and her expected wage.

Withheld amount = Total amount in the account - Expected wage
Withheld amount = $620 - $300
Withheld amount = $320

Therefore, $320 was withheld from Sally's wage."
"To determine the number of eggs needed, we first need to calculate the total number of deviled egg halves required. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves and there are 16 guests, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is 3 * 16 = 48.

Since each egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2 to find the total number of eggs required. 48 / 2 = 24.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the cooking time for the pork and then the beans. 

Since it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice, and it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

The cooking time for beans is half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. So, the combined cooking time for pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Therefore, the cooking time for beans is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we can find the total cooking time by adding the cooking times for all three items: 30 (rice) + 50 (pork) + 40 (beans) = 120 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. 

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of legs can be represented as 4s + 2g = 70.

Since each animal has one head, the total number of heads is s + g = 20.

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of 's' and 'g'. 

First, we can express 'g' in terms of 's' from the second equation: g = 20 - s.

Now, substitute 'g' in the first equation: 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70.

Simplify the equation: 4s + 40 - 2s = 70.

Combine like terms: 2s + 40 = 70.

Subtract 40 from both sides: 2s = 30.

Divide both sides by 2: s = 15.

Therefore, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, James had 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he had 1 toy per dog. 

When he left, there were 8 more dogs in the shelter, making a total of 4 + 8 = 12 dogs. Since each dog needs one toy, James needed 12 toys.

However, when he returned, there were twice as many dogs as when he left, which means there were 2 * 12 = 24 dogs. Since he already had 12 toys, he needed 24 - 12 = 12 more toys.

After buying the additional toys, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needed those toys. This means he had 12 + 12 = 24 toys, but 3 were not needed. 

So, James now has 24 - 3 = 21 toys.

Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, which is (2/5) * 1200 = 480 dollars.

The remaining amount after Dylan's investment is 1200 - 480 = 720 dollars.

Frances then invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, which is (2/3) * 720 = 480 dollars.

The amount left after Frances' investment is 720 - 480 = 240 dollars.

This remaining amount is Skyler's investment.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find out how many signatures the sisters need to collect, we first need to determine the total number of signatures they currently have. 

Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. 

Total signatures currently = 20 + 44 = 64 signatures.

The sisters want to reach 100 signatures by the end of the summer. To find out how many more signatures they need, we subtract the total signatures they currently have from their goal.

Signatures needed = 100 - 64 = 36 signatures.

The sisters need 36 more signatures to reach their goal."
"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we first need to determine her hourly wage. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.

Next, we need to calculate how much Karen earns in two days. Since she works 3 hours per day, we multiply her hourly wage by the number of hours she works per day and then by the number of days.

$20 per hour * 3 hours per day = $60 per day
$60 per day * 2 days = $120

Therefore, Karen earns $120 in two days."
"To find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we need to determine the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. 

Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can set up a proportion to find the number of hash browns for 96 potatoes.

Let's set up the proportion: 
6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:
6x = 36 * 96
6x = 3456
x = 3456 / 6
x = 576

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

"To find the total weight of the 9 people, we need to multiply the weight of one adult by the number of adults. 

Total weight = 9 adults * 80 kg/adult = 720 kg

Since the elevator's maximum load is 700 kg, the excess weight is the difference between the total weight and the maximum load.

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

The elevator's maximum load will be exceeded by 20 kg."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cookies Max has, and then determine the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has. 

Since Katarina has 68 cookies and she has 5 less cookies than Max, we can find out how many cookies Max has by adding 5 to Katarina's total: 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Now that we know Max has 73 cookies, we can find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has by subtracting 12 from Max's total: 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so we can find out how many cookies Summer has by adding 23 to Max's total: 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now that we know the number of cookies each person has, we can find the total number of cookies by adding them together: 68 + 73 + 96 = 237 cookies.

The final answer is: 237"
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to work backwards from the final length. 

Let's denote the original length of the dress as x. 

Since the dress was extended by 50% of its original length, the new length is x + 0.5x = 1.5x. 

Additionally, 20cm was added to the bottom of the dress. 

The final length of the dress is 140cm, so we can set up the equation: 1.5x + 20 = 140.

Now, we can solve for x: 
1.5x = 140 - 20
1.5x = 120
x = 120 / 1.5
x = 80

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

"To find the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the time it took him to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode.

Since Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour in ""turtle"" mode, he can mow half the lawn in 0.5 hours, which is 30 minutes.

In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Therefore, he can mow half the lawn in 20 minutes.

To find the total time, we add the time it took to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode (30 minutes) and half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode (20 minutes).

Total time = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to calculate the total time they have spent walking so far and subtract it from the total time available.

They have spent 6 minutes walking to the corner and 13 minutes walking to the fire station. 

Total time spent walking so far = 6 + 13 = 19 minutes

Time available = 30 minutes

Time left = Time available - Total time spent walking so far
Time left = 30 - 19
Time left = 11 minutes

Therefore, John and Jack have 11 minutes to get to school without being late."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 1 kilo of apples is $4.
The cost of 2 kilos of bananas is 2 * $2 = $4.
The cost of 2 kilos of oranges is 2 * $3 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4 (apples) + $4 (bananas) + $6 (oranges) = $14.

Catherine pays a total of $14."
"To determine the number of cookies in the box, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies baked by both Greta and Celinda. 

Greta bakes 30 cookies, and Celinda bakes twice as many, so Celinda bakes 2 * 30 = 60 cookies. 

The total number of cookies baked is 30 (Greta's cookies) + 60 (Celinda's cookies) = 90 cookies.

The pair eats 10 cookies, so the number of cookies left is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the age of the younger twin as 'x'. Since there is one set of twins, the age of the older twin would be 'x + 7'. 

We also know that there is a set of triplets, so we'll denote the age of the youngest triplet as 'y'. The ages of the other two triplets would be 'y + 1' and 'y + 2'. 

The combined ages of the twins and the triplets are given as 44. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 7) + y + (y + 1) + (y + 2) = 44

Combine like terms:

2x + 3y + 10 = 44

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x + 3y = 34

Now, we need to find integer values of x and y that satisfy this equation. Since x is the age of a twin and y is the age of a triplet, both x and y should be non-negative integers.

Let's try different values of y to find a solution. 

If y = 4, then 3y = 12, and 2x = 22. Solving for x, we get x = 11.

So, one of the twins is 11 years old.

The final answer is: 11"
"To determine how many minutes John has to nap, we need to calculate the total time he has available before dinner. 

First, we need to convert the time before dinner from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 3 hours is equal to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time John has for his homework: 20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes.

To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we subtract the total homework time from the total available time before dinner: 180 minutes (available time) - 80 minutes (homework time) = 100 minutes.

John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To find the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we need to calculate the cost of each separately and then add them together.

The cost of 10 lollipops is 10 * $0.40 = $4.00.

The cost of 10 candies is 10 * $3.20 = $32.00.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4.00 + $32.00 = $36.00.

The final answer is: $36.00"
"To find the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after ten years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 120 months (10 years).

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

The total number of coins Rong saves in a year is 20 * 12 = 240 coins.
The total number of coins Neil saves in a year is 28 * 12 = 336 coins.

After 10 years, Rong will have 240 * 10 = 2400 coins.
Neil will have 336 * 10 = 3360 coins.

The total number of coins they have after ten years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

"To find out how much John leaves with, we need to calculate the total cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. 

The cost of 2 vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so we need to find 60% of the total cost. Let's denote the total cost as x. The equation for the heartworm check is 0.6x. 

Since the total cost is the sum of the cost of vaccines and the heartworm check, we can write the equation as: x = $40 + 0.6x. 

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40. 

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100. 

The total cost is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of the total cost, so the heartworm check is 0.6 * $100 = $60. 

The total cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check is $40 + $60 = $100. 

John brought $125, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25."
"To determine the price of the crate, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

First, we know that one banana costs twice as much as an apple, and one apple costs $0.5. Therefore, one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

Next, we know that oranges are three times as expensive as bananas. Since one banana costs $1, one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each type of fruit in the crate:

- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Adding these costs together, we get the total cost of the crate: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

Therefore, the price for such a crate of fruit is $32."
"To find the total number of squares, we need to determine the number of each color. 

We know there are 14 red squares. Since there are 4 more blue squares than red squares, there are 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.

There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so there are 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.

There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so there are 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, we add up the number of squares of each color: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

"To determine the number of chairs Mia needs to get, we first need to find out how many regular chairs she has. Since the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:

Number of regular chairs = 5 * Number of high chairs
= 5 * 8
= 40

Now, we need to find the total number of chairs needed. There are 42 adults and 15 babies attending, so the total number of people is 42 + 15 = 57.

Since Mia already has 40 regular chairs and 8 high chairs, the total number of chairs she has is 40 + 8 = 48.

To find out how many more chairs she needs, we subtract the total number of chairs she has from the total number of people:

Number of chairs needed = Total number of people - Total number of chairs
= 57 - 48
= 9

Therefore, Mia needs 9 more chairs."
"To find the number of 8-point bucks, we need to calculate 20% of the total number of bucks.

So, there are 5 eight-point bucks."
"To find the total points collected by the students, we need to calculate the points for each student.

Adam has 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 
30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15.
So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. 
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by all the students: 
Adam + Betty + Marta + Tom = 50 + 65 + 105 + 35 = 255 points.

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. 
The class is missing 400 - 255 = 145 points to go on the trip.

"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks from the city display and the number of fireworks she sets off in her backyard.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks from the city display. Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks and there are 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, we can calculate the total number of fireworks in the city display as follows:

15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = 300 fireworks

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we can calculate the number of fireworks she will see as follows:

300 fireworks * 0.4 = 120 fireworks

Next, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah sets off in her backyard. She sets off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so:

3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = 15 fireworks

Now, we can add the number of fireworks Hannah sees from the city display and the number of fireworks she sets off in her backyard to find the total number of fireworks she will see:

120 fireworks + 15 fireworks = 135 fireworks

"To find the total amount of money spent on snacks and drinks, we first need to calculate the total number of people and the total number of drinks and snacks.

Aiden and his 12 friends are initially 13 people. Then, they meet up with 7 more friends, making the total number of people 13 + 7 = 20.

Each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks. Since there are 20 people, there are 20 seats. 

For 20 people, the number of drinks needed is 20 * 2 = 40 drinks.
For 20 people, the number of snacks needed is 20 * 3 = 60 snacks.

The cost of each drink and snack is $2. So, the total cost of drinks is 40 * $2 = $80.
The total cost of snacks is 60 * $2 = $120.

The total amount of money spent on snacks and drinks is $80 + $120 = $200.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much gravel Gissela's truck can carry. 

Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

The total capacity of the three trucks combined is 11,600 pounds. We know that Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds and Gordy's truck can carry 4,800 pounds. 

So, the total capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds.

To find out how much gravel Gary's truck can carry, we subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity of all three trucks. 

11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many dumplings each male ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

There are 6 females, and each female ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is the sum of the dumplings eaten by males and females. Therefore, Larry cooked 32 + 18 = 50 dumplings.

"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. 

Speed of the cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5 = 15 / 5 = 3 feet/second

Now, we can find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

The turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we need to first determine the amount they still need to raise, which is the difference between their goal and the amount already raised.

Amount already raised = $2100
Goal = $6300
Amount still needed = Goal - Amount already raised
= $6300 - $2100
= $4200

Since they raise an equal amount in every hour, we can divide the amount still needed by the hourly amount to find the number of hours they need to fundraise.

Amount still needed = $4200
Hourly amount = $2100 / 3 hours = $700 per hour

Number of hours = Amount still needed / Hourly amount
= $4200 / $700
= 6 hours

Therefore, the firefighters need to fundraise for 6 more hours to reach their goal.

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city, and then subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes.

The city uses 40% of the river's water. Since 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes, we can find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes by subtracting 80% from 40%.

40% - 80% = -40%

However, this would result in a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. This is because 80% of 40% is greater than 40%. 

Let's recalculate the percentage used for non-industrial purposes by finding the percentage of the river's total water used by the city and subtracting the percentage used for industrial purposes from 100%.

First, we need to find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city. Since 80% of 40% is 32%, we can set up an equation to find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city.

Let x be the percentage of the river's total water used by the city. Then, 80% of x is 32%. 

0.8x = 32%

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.8.

x = 32% / 0.8
x = 40%

Now that we know the city uses 40% of the river's total water, we can find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes by subtracting 40% from 100%.

100% - 40% = 60%

Therefore, the city uses 60% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

The chocolate ice cream production rate is 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour.
The vanilla ice cream production rate is 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we can calculate the total production in 48 hours:
- Chocolate ice cream production in 48 hours: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
- Vanilla ice cream production in 48 hours: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Total production in 48 hours: 2400 quarts + 600 quarts = 3000 quarts

The total cost of the cinnamon rolls is 4 x $2.50 = $10.00.
The total cost of the mini quiches is 3 x $4.00 = $12.00.
The total cost of the blueberry muffins is 13 x $1.00 = $13.00.

The total cost of all the items is $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

Applying the 10% discount, the discount amount is 10% of $50.00, which is 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00.

"To determine the number of scoops Erin should buy, we need to calculate the total cost of the scoops she can afford with her $6.00. 

Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide $6.00 by $1.50 to find out how many scoops she can buy. 

$6.00 / $1.50 = 4 scoops

However, the deal is buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. This means for every 3 scoops, Erin only pays for 2. 

So, we can divide the total number of scoops she can afford by 3 to find out how many sets of the deal she can get. 

4 scoops / 3 scoops per set = 1.33 sets

Since Erin can't buy a fraction of a set, she can buy 1 set of the deal, which includes 3 scoops. 

Therefore, Erin should buy 3 scoops of ice cream.

The total amount of money the company paid to buy the computers at the new prices is $385,000."
"To calculate the total calories in the omelet, we need to calculate the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham separately and then add them together.

The omelet contains 6 eggs, each with 75 calories. So, the total calories from eggs are 6 * 75 = 450 calories.

The omelet contains 2 oz of cheese, with 120 calories per ounce. So, the total calories from cheese are 2 * 120 = 240 calories.

The omelet also contains 2 oz of ham, with 40 calories per ounce. So, the total calories from ham are 2 * 40 = 80 calories.

"To find the difference in the number of boxes of cereal bought this week and last week, we need to subtract the number of boxes bought last week from the number of boxes bought this week.

Number of boxes bought this week = 3 (Coco Crunch) + 5 (Fruit Loops) = 8
Number of boxes bought last week = 4

Difference = Number of boxes bought this week - Number of boxes bought last week
= 8 - 4
= 4

The difference in the number of boxes of cereal bought this week and last week is 4."
"To find the total number of taps, we need to calculate the number of taps per minute for each scenario and then multiply it by the time spent in that scenario.

When both hands are at her sides, Helga taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute. So, the combined rate is 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute.

When her arms are raised, the combined rate is 200 taps per minute.

Helga dances for 5 minutes in total. She spends 2 minutes with her arms raised and 3 minutes with her arms at her sides.

The number of taps with her arms raised is 200 taps per minute * 2 minutes = 400 taps.

The number of taps with her arms at her sides is 550 taps per minute * 3 minutes = 1650 taps.

The total number of taps is 400 + 1650 = 2050 taps.

The final answer is: 2050"
"To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the potential damage to his car.

The potential damage to Ron's car is $450. 

The cost of fixing the pothole himself includes the cost of the asphalt (3 buckets * $25 = $75) and the fine he would have received from the city council ($120). 

So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $75 (asphalt) + $120 (fine) = $195.

By fixing the pothole himself, Ron saves $195 (total cost) - $450 (potential damage) = -$255. However, since he can't save money by doing something that would cause damage, we need to consider the cost of the asphalt and the fine as a loss. 

Therefore, Ron actually incurs a loss of $195.

The final answer is: -$195"
"To find the total number of chairs left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs sent for repair: 
20 normal chairs + 13 baby chairs = 33 chairs

Now, subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs:
170 normal chairs + 23 baby chairs = 193 total chairs
193 total chairs - 33 chairs sent for repair = 160 chairs left

The restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"To find out how many slices of pizza were left, we need to calculate the total number of slices first. Since there are 5 people, including Bryce, and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 2 pizzas for these 3 people, they ate 2 * 2/3 = 4/3 pizzas. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 4/3 by 12, which is 16 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 pizzas for these 2 friends, they ate 2 * ¾ = 1 ½ pizzas. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 1 ½ by 12, which is 18 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices eaten by all the friends: 16 slices (Bryce and two friends) + 18 slices (the two remaining friends) = 34 slices.

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total slices eaten from the total number of slices: 60 - 34 = 26.

"To find the average time the cat and dog take to eat the sausages, we first need to calculate the time it takes for each to eat the sausages.

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. 

The dog eats the same number of sausages (9) in 2/3 the time it takes the cat. 
So, the dog eats 9 sausages in (2/3) * 30 minutes = 20 minutes.

Now, we need to find the average time. To do this, we add the time taken by the cat and the dog and divide by 2.

Average time = (30 minutes + 20 minutes) / 2
Average time = 50 minutes / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

The average time the cat and dog take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to inches. 

First, we convert 8 feet to inches: 8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches. Then, we add the 4 inches to get 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of Bobby's shoe as x. Then, we can set up the equation:

9x + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

9x = 90

Divide both sides by 9:

x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."
"To find the total number of windows smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for students' cars and teachers' cars separately and then add them together.

For students' cars:

Number of windows per car = 4
Total windows smashed for students' cars = 64 * 4 = 256

For teachers' cars:
Number of teachers' cars = 32
Number of windows per car = 2
Total windows smashed for teachers' cars = 32 * 2 = 64

Total windows smashed = 256 (students' cars) + 64 (teachers' cars) = 320

"To determine the number of packs Parker needs, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of gum he consumes in 30 days. 

Since Parker chews 4 pieces of gum per day, in 30 days, he will chew 4 * 30 = 120 pieces of gum.

Since each pack has 15 pieces of gum, we can divide the total number of pieces Parker will chew (120) by the number of pieces per pack (15) to find out how many packs he needs:

120 / 15 = 8

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

"To determine the total number of smores needed, we first calculate the total number of smores required for the kids and adults separately.

For the kids: 9 kids * 2 smores/kid = 18 smores
For the adults: 6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 6 smores

Total smores needed = 18 smores (kids) + 6 smores (adults) = 24 smores

Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, we divide the total number of smores needed by 8 to find out how many sleeves are required:

24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need:

3 sleeves / 3 sleeves/box = 1 box

Therefore, they will need 1 box of graham crackers."
"To find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to first determine the ages of Dora's father and mother.

Dora's age is given as 15 years. 

Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 
So, Dora's father's age = 2 * 15 + 8 = 38 years.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. 
So, Dora's mother's age = 38 - 4 = 34 years.

Now, we can find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother by adding their ages together.
Combined age = Dora's age + Dora's father's age + Dora's mother's age
= 15 + 38 + 34
= 87 years.

Steven's books = 20 / 2
Steven's books = 10

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find out how many books Alice has. 
Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so:
Alice's books = Steven's books + 6
Alice's books = 10 + 6
Alice's books = 16

"To find the number of boys in each class, we first need to determine the total number of students in each class. Since there are two classes with the same number of students, we divide the total number of students by 2.

Total students = 80
Number of classes = 2
Students per class = Total students / Number of classes
Students per class = 80 / 2
Students per class = 40

Now, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of boys, we need to find 100% - 40% = 60% of the students.

Number of girls per class = 40% of 40
Number of girls per class = 0.4 * 40

Since 54 students are to be separated into 6 groups of equal size, we can calculate the number of students per group as follows:

54 students / 6 groups = 9 students per group

However, the question states that 12 groups are already required. To find out how many more groups are needed, we can divide the total number of students by the number of groups already required:

54 students / 12 groups = 4.5 students per group

Since we cannot have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to accommodate all the students. 

To accommodate 54 students in 12 groups, we would need 5 students per group. 

To find the number of additional groups needed, we can subtract the number of groups already required from the total number of groups needed:

12 groups (already required) - 6 groups (initially planned) = 6 groups

However, the question asks for the number of additional groups needed, not the total number of groups. Since we already have 6 groups, we need to find the difference between the number of groups needed and the number of groups already required:

6 groups (already required) - 6 groups (initially planned) = 0 groups

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. 
Since a small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from this trade.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. 
Since a large button is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 large buttons from this trade.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
She had 40 large stickers initially and traded 20 for large buttons, so she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left. 
Since a large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers from this trade.

Now, let's calculate the total number of buttons she has:
- She has 27 small buttons from the first trade.
- She has 20 large buttons from the second trade.
- She has 60 small buttons from the third trade.

So, the total number of buttons she has is 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 buttons.

"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic equation. Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as x. Since the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it, the number of votes in favor can be represented as 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and the sum of votes in favor and against must equal the total number of council members. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x (votes against) + 2x (votes in favor) = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Now that we know x (votes against) is 11, we can find the number of votes in favor by multiplying x by 2:

Votes in favor = 2x = 2 * 11 = 22

4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

People who think horse #12 will win = Total people - People who think horse #2 will win - People who think horse #7 will win
= 50 - 10 - 24
= 16 people.

The final answer is 16."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. 

Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can set up the equation: 
1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides by 3:
Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let's denote the total number of puppies as 'x'. 
We can set up the equation: 
2/3 * x = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:
x = 18 * 3/2
x = 27

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies.

"To find out how much Jayden needs, we first need to calculate how much money he has after receiving the money from his sister. 

Jayden initially had $70. His sister gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $90 / 2 = $45. 

So, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115.

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera: $200 - $115 = $85.

Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.

"To determine the number of cases of shingles the third house needs, we need to first calculate the number of cases needed for the first and second houses.

The total number of cases needed is 250. The first house needs half of the second house, so if we let x be the number of cases needed for the second house, the first house needs x/2 cases.

Since the third house needs double the first house, it needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases.

We know that the sum of the cases needed for all three houses is 250, so we can set up the equation:

x + x/2 + x = 250

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + x + 2x = 500

Combine like terms:

5x = 500

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 100

Now that we know the second house needs 100 cases, we can find the number of cases needed for the third house:

Third house = 2 * (100) = 200

The third house needs 200 cases of shingles.

"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

Leila buys 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so she spends 3 x $2 = $6.
Jack buys 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so he spends 5 x $1 = $5.
Chase buys 1 head of lettuce at $3.

Now, let's add the costs together: $6 (cucumbers) + $5 (tomatoes) + $3 (lettuce) = $14.

The total amount spent by the three of them is $14."
"To find the number of pears George has, we need to calculate 45% of the number of bananas he has and add it to the number of bananas.

45% of 200 bananas = 0.45 * 200 = 90

So, George has 90 more pears than bananas. 

To find the total number of pears, we add 90 to the number of bananas: 200 + 90 = 290

Therefore, George has 290 fruits in total.

290"
"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to first determine how much money she had left after buying the ball. 

She started with $80 and spent $20 on the ball, so she had $80 - $20 = $60 left.

Since each candy bar costs $5, we can divide the remaining amount by the cost of one candy bar to find out how many she bought: $60 / $5 = 12.

Therefore, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

12"
"To determine the total cost of making 4 liters of juice, we first need to find out how many kilograms of oranges are required for 4 liters of juice. 

Since 1 liter of juice requires 5 kilograms of oranges, 4 liters will require 4 times that amount, which is 4 * 5 = 20 kilograms of oranges.

Each kilogram of oranges costs $3, so the total cost for 20 kilograms of oranges would be 20 * $3 = $60.

Therefore, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice.

60"
"To find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed, we need to first determine how many books Ahmed read. 

Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, and Ezra read 300 books, we can divide 300 by 2 to find out how many books Ahmed read. 

300 / 2 = 150

So, Ahmed read 150 books.

Now, we need to add the number of books Ezra read initially (300) to the number of books he read later (150). 

300 + 150 = 450

Now, we add the number of books Ahmed read to the total number of books Ezra read. 

150 + 450 = 600

Therefore, they read 600 books altogether.

The final answer is: 600"
"To calculate Tanya's total earnings for the two days, we need to break it down into two parts: her hourly wage and the additional daily bonus.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours, so her total earnings for Monday would be:
- 4 classes * $15 per class = $60
- 5 hours * $15 per hour = $75
- Total earnings for Monday = $60 + $75 = $135

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours, so her total earnings for Wednesday would be:
- 2 classes * $15 per class = $30
- 2 hours * $15 per hour = $30
- Total earnings for Wednesday = $30 + $30 = $60

Now, we need to add the earnings from both days to get the total:
- Total earnings = $135 (Monday) + $60 (Wednesday) = $195

Tanya also earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes. Since she teaches 4 classes on Monday, she earns the daily bonus for Monday. On Wednesday, she teaches 2 classes, which is less than 3, so she doesn't earn the daily bonus.

Therefore, Tanya's total earnings for the two days are $195.

"To determine the difference in sales between vanilla and fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

Vanilla scents sold: 5 scents per type * 4 types = 20 scents
Fruity scents sold: 2 scents per type * 8 types = 16 scents

Now, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold to find the difference:
20 (vanilla) - 16 (fruity) = 4

The company sold 4 more vanilla scents compared to fruity scents.

"To determine how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has made from selling eggplants. 

Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount of money he made from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, we need to subtract the amount he made from eggplants from the total amount he wants to make. 

$135 - $60 = $75

Now, we need to divide the remaining amount by the number of ears of corn he has, which is 25. 

$75 / 25 = $3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

"To find the total time Tatiana has available for soccer, we need to subtract the time she spends reading and playing video games from her total weekend time.

Total weekend time = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours

Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time after reading
Remaining time after reading = 12 - 3 = 9 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours

Time spent playing soccer = Total weekend time - Time spent reading - Time spent playing video games
Time spent playing soccer = 12 - 3 - 3 = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total weekend time and multiply by 100:

Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Anthony started with 50 pencils.
2. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, which is 1/2 * 50 = 25 pencils. So, he has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.
3. He then gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie, which is 3/5 * 25 = 15 pencils. So, he has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Anthony kept 10 pencils.

"To determine the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes to drive to the museum and back.

Time taken to drive to the museum = Distance / Speed
Time taken to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Since Jack spends 6 hours at the museum, we need to add the time taken to drive to the museum and the time spent at the museum to get the total time.

Total time = Time taken to drive to the museum + Time spent at the museum
Total time = 2 hours + 6 hours = 8 hours

Therefore, Jack is gone from home for 8 hours.

"To find the total number of wheels needed, we need to calculate the number of wheels required for the cars and the number of wheels required for the motorcycles.

For the cars, Henry needs 4 wheels for each car. Since he needs 57 cars, the total number of wheels required for the cars is 57 * 4 = 228.

For the motorcycles, Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle. Since he needs 73 motorcycles, the total number of wheels required for the motorcycles is 73 * 2 = 146.

The total number of wheels required for both cars and motorcycles is 228 + 146 = 374.

Henry has 650 wheels in the box. To find the number of wheels left, we subtract the total number of wheels required from the total number of wheels available: 650 - 374 = 276.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the number of movies in series. 
Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate this as follows:
Number of movies in series = Total number of movies / 3
Number of movies in series = 600 / 3
Number of movies in series = 200

Step 2: Calculate the number of remaining movies.
Number of remaining movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies in series
Number of remaining movies = 600 - 200
Number of remaining movies = 400

Step 3: Calculate the number of older movies.
40% of the remaining movies are older movies. 
Number of older movies = 0.4 * Number of remaining movies
Number of older movies = 0.4 * 400
Number of older movies = 160

Step 4: Calculate the cost of the movies in series.
Since the movies in series cost $6 each, the total cost of the movies in series is:
Cost of movies in series = Number of movies in series * $6
Cost of movies in series = 200 * $6
Cost of movies in series = $1200

Step 5: Calculate the cost of the older movies.
Since the older movies cost $5 each, the total cost of the older movies is:
Cost of older movies = Number of older movies * $5
Cost of older movies = 160 * $5
Cost of older movies = $800

Step 6: Calculate the cost of the normal movies.
Since the remaining movies are normal movies, the number of normal movies is:
Number of normal movies = Number of remaining movies - Number of older movies
Number of normal movies = 400 - 160
Number of normal movies = 240
The cost of the normal movies is:
Cost of normal movies = Number of normal movies * $10
Cost of normal movies = 240 * $10
Cost of normal movies = $2400

Step 7: Calculate the total cost of replacing the movies.
Total cost = Cost of movies in series + Cost of older movies + Cost of normal movies
Total cost = $1200 + $800 + $2400
Total cost = $4400

The final answer is: $4400"

The cost of plums is 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00
The cost of apricots is 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, let's add the costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to first calculate the speed at which they hiked. 

The Llesis family drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour. They hiked at an average speed that was 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. 

Half of their driving speed is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. 

Their hiking speed is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour. 

Since they hiked for 1.5 hours, the distance they covered while hiking is 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

The total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked. 

The distance they drove is 50 * 6 = 300 miles. 

The total distance to their vacation spot is 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

"To determine the difference in scores, we need to calculate the points earned by each player.

Let's denote Emma's points as E and Ava's points as A.

Emma's points: 
- She collects 3 more berries than Ava, so she collects 3 + 5 = 8 berries.
- She jumps on fewer enemies than Ava, so she jumps on 8 - 8 = 0 enemies.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, so she finishes the level in 30 - 4 = 26 seconds.

Emma's points = 0 * 10 (for enemies) + 8 * 5 (for berries) + 26 * 30 (for time) = 0 + 40 + 780 = 820.

Ava's points:
- She collects 8 berries.
- She jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumps on 8 + 0 = 8 enemies.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so she finishes the level in 26 + 4 = 30 seconds.

Ava's points = 8 * 10 (for enemies) + 8 * 5 (for berries) + 30 * 30 (for time) = 80 + 40 + 900 = 1020.

The difference between their scores is 1020 - 820 = 200.

"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of 64 dollars.

Total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars: 2 * 30 = 60 dollars

Now, subtract this amount from the total cost: 64 - 60 = 4 dollars

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can divide the remaining cost by 2 to find the cost of each pizza: 4 / 2 = 2 dollars

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of times they ride their bikes on the three usual days and the two extra days.

On the usual days, they ride thrice a day, so that's 3 times per day * 5 days = 15 times.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, so that's 2 * 3 times per day = 6 times per day * 2 days = 12 times.

Now, we add the total number of times they ride on both types of days: 15 times + 12 times = 27 times.

Therefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times a week.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. 

After the sales assistant took out 17 fish, the number of orange fish became 3 - 17 = -14, but since you can't have a negative number of fish, we know that the sales assistant must have taken out all the orange fish. 

This means that the 17 fish taken out were all white. 

Now, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's denote the number of white fish he bought as 'x'. 

Since he already had 4 white fish, the total number of white fish now is 4 + x. 

The number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, so it is 2 * (4 + x). 

We know that the total number of fish is 7 + x (since he bought x white fish). 

We can set up the equation: 2 * (4 + x) = 7 + x.

Expanding the equation, we get: 8 + 2x = 7 + x.

Subtracting x from both sides, we get: 8 + x = 7.

Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get: x = -1.

However, we can't have a negative number of fish, so this solution doesn't make sense. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. 

We know that the sales assistant took out 17 fish, and all of them were white. 

So, the number of white fish now is 4 + 17 = 21. 

The number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, so it is 2 * 21 = 42. 

The total number of fish is 21 + 42 = 63. 

Since Bob initially had 7 fish, the number of fish he bought is 63 - 7 = 56. 

Since 17 of the fish bought were white, the number of white fish bought is 17. 

The final answer is: 17"
"To calculate the amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to first calculate the total miles driven per week. 

Since Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days. The one-way distance is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 10 miles per day. 

Total miles driven per week = 5 days * 10 miles/day = 50 miles

Now, we can calculate the amount of gas consumed per week. 

Gas consumption per week = Total miles driven per week / Fuel efficiency
Gas consumption per week = 50 miles / 10 MPG
Gas consumption per week = 5 gallons

Now, we can calculate the cost of gas consumed per week. 

Cost of gas per week = Gas consumption per week * Price per gallon
Cost of gas per week = 5 gallons * $3/gallon
Cost of gas per week = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch, we need to calculate the amount she spent on the twenties and the quarters separately.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on the twenties. She was given 10 twenties and spent 3/5 of them. 

3/5 of 10 twenties is (3/5) * 10 = 6 twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, she spent 6 * $20 = $120 on the twenties.

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on the quarters. She was given 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, she spent 140 * $0.25 = $35 on the quarters.

Now, we add the amount she spent on the twenties and the quarters to find the total amount she paid for lunch. 

$120 (twenties) + $35 (quarters) = $155.

The total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch is $155."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the temperature difference between the day and night, and then calculate how many logs are needed to heat up the house to the freezing point.

The temperature difference between the day and night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since each log heats up the house by 5 degrees, we can divide the temperature difference by the heating capacity of each log to find the number of logs needed:

12 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 2.4 logs

Since we can't burn a fraction of a log, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure the house is heated enough to prevent the pipes from freezing. Therefore, Carson needs to burn 3 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

"To find the total number of seashells brought back, we first need to determine the number of groups and the number of seashells each group brought back.

Given that 3/5 of the number of groups had members bring back seashells, and there are 90 people in total, we can calculate the number of groups as follows:

Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
= 90 / 9
= 10

Since 3/5 of the groups had members bring back seashells, we can calculate the number of groups that brought back seashells as follows:

Number of groups with seashells = 3/5 * Number of groups
= 3/5 * 10
= 6

Each group brought back 2 seashells, so the total number of seashells brought back is:

Total seashells = Number of groups with seashells * Number of seashells per group

"To find out how much Billy earns, we need to calculate his hourly wage after the two raises. 

Billy's initial hourly wage was $10. After the first raise of $0.50, his new wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. After the second raise of $1.00, his new wage is $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Now, we can calculate Billy's total earnings for 20 hours of work: $11.50 * 20 = $230.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's starting salary, so her starting salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. 

Sally's hourly wage is also $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage, so her hourly wage is $10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00. 

Now, we can calculate Sally's total earnings for 20 hours of work: $11.00 * 20 = $220.

"To find Nikita's score, we need to calculate half of Pierson's score and then add 11 to it. 

Half of Pierson's score is 278 / 2 = 139. 
Nikita's score is 139 + 11 = 150.

Now, to find the total score, we add Pierson's score to Nikita's score: 
278 (Pierson's score) + 150 (Nikita's score) = 428.

The total score of Pierson and Nikita is 428."
"To find the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately.

Number of students = 40 classes * 25 students per class = 1000 students
Number of teachers = 40 classes * 3 teachers per class = 120 teachers

Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

The total number of trees planted is the sum of the trees planted by students and teachers, which is 1000 + 240 = 1240.

The final answer is: 1240"
"To find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has, we need to add the number of each type of stuffed animal she has: 

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Since Bubbles wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up an equation to find the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she buys as 'x'. 

The total number of stuffed animals after buying 'x' goats will be 14 + x. The percentage of stuffed goats should be 30% of this total, so we can set up the equation:

( x / (14 + x) ) * 100 = 30

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by (14 + x) to get rid of the fraction:

x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side of the equation:

x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtract 0.3x from both sides to isolate 'x':

0.7x = 4.2

Divide both sides by 0.7:

x = 6

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To determine how many hours Kris needs to play to earn the achievement, we need to calculate the total hours she has already played and subtract that from the required 30 hours.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 14 days. Half an hour is 0.5 hours. 

Total hours played in 2 weeks = 14 days * 0.5 hours/day = 7 hours

Kris then plays for 2 hours every day for a week. There are 7 days in a week, so 1 week is 7 days. 

Total hours played in 1 week = 7 days * 2 hours/day = 14 hours

Total hours played so far = 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours

To earn the achievement, Kris needs 30 hours. She has already played 21 hours. 

Hours left to play = 30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between those distances.

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will cover a distance of 60 * 2 = 120 miles.

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will cover a distance of 70 * 2 = 140 miles.

The distance between the two cars after 2 hours will be the difference between the distances they have traveled, which is 140 - 120 = 20 miles.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the premium first. The premium is 30% of the total cost of the diamond and gold. 

The total cost of the diamond and gold is $600 + $300 = $900. 

The premium is 30% of $900, which is 0.3 * $900 = $270.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the diamond and gold, and the premium. So, the total cost is $900 + $270 = $1170.

The final answer is: $1170"
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

The number of third-graders who passed is 340, and the number of fourth-graders who passed is 40. 

Since the number of fifth-graders is 400, and their pass rate is twice that of the fourth-graders, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 2 * 40 = 80.

Now, we can calculate the total number of students who passed: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460.

The total number of students in the school is 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students in the school: 460 / 1000 = 0.46, or 46%.

The final answer is 46%."
"To determine the total number of square inches Milo can create with the glass chips, we first need to find out how many square inches he can make with one bag of chips. 

Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, and there are 72 chips in a bag, we divide 72 by 12 to find the number of square inches one bag can make: 72 / 12 = 6 square inches.

Since Milo has two bags, we multiply the number of square inches one bag can make by 2: 6 * 2 = 12 square inches.

Now, we need to find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic. Since the mosaic is three inches tall, we divide the total square inches by the height to find the length: 12 / 3 = 4 inches.

The final answer is 4."
"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount each group of students drank and then add them together.

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.
16 students drank 2 quarts each, so 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

Total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the initial amount of tea can be found by adding the consumed amount to the remaining amount: 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we divide by 4 (since 1 gallon = 4 quarts). 
48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and subtract the number of candies he has already sold.

Initially, Dale had 100 candies. He sold 150, but then he ordered 100 more. So, the total number of candies he has now is 100 (initial) + 100 (new order) = 200 candies.

Since he has 200 candies and he wants to sell all of them, we subtract the number of candies he has sold (150) from the total number of candies he has (200).

200 (total candies) - 150 (candies sold) = 50

Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of May.

At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students.

By the end of January, the number of students doubles, so there are 10 * 2 = 20 students.

By the end of February, the number of students doubles again, so there are 20 * 2 = 40 students.

By the end of March, the number of students doubles again, so there are 40 * 2 = 80 students.

By the end of April, the number of students doubles again, so there are 80 * 2 = 160 students.

By the end of May, the number of students doubles again, so there are 160 * 2 = 320 students.

The number of additional students who joined above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year is 320 - 10 = 310.

"To find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to first find the total number of branches he climbed in a week. 

Since Felix made $105 in a week, and he charges $0.25 per branch, we can divide the total amount he made by the cost per branch to find the total number of branches he climbed:

$105 / $0.25 = 420 branches

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches he climbed per day:

420 branches / 7 days = 60 branches per day

The total number of petals in the vase is 101."
"To determine the number of S'mores each kid can have, we first need to calculate the total number of marshmallows used and subtract that from the total number of marshmallows in the bag.

Total marshmallows in the bag = 35
Total marshmallows used by John and DeSean = 9 + 9 = 18
Total marshmallows dropped on the ground = 3
Total marshmallows left in the bag = 35 - 18 - 3 = 14

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the number of S'mores that can be made with the remaining marshmallows is 14.

To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we need to divide the total number of S'mores that can be made by 2, as there are two kids.

Number of S'mores each kid can have = 14 / 2 = 7

Therefore, each kid can have 7 S'mores."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person played and then multiply it by the cost per game.

First, let's convert 4 hours to minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time each person played:

- Jack played for 20 minutes.
- One of his friends played for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes.
- The other friend played for 10 minutes.

The better friend played for 1.5 * 20 = 30 minutes.

Now, let's add up the total time played: 20 + 10 + 10 + 30 = 70 minutes.

Since Jack played for 20 minutes, the other three friends played for 50 minutes in total (70 - 20 = 50 minutes). 

Now, let's calculate the cost of the games played:

- Jack played for 20 minutes, so he spent 20 / 20 = 1 quarter.
- The other three friends played for 50 minutes, so they spent 50 / 20 = 2.5 quarters each.

The total cost is 1 (Jack) + 2.5 * 3 (other friends) = 1 + 7.5 = 8.5 quarters.

Since 1 quarter is equal to $0.25, the total cost is 8.5 * $0.25 = $2.125.

The final answer is: $2.125"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the amount of citrus zest as x. Since Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also x.

Given that she uses twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest, we can express the amount of salt as 2x and the amount of oil as 4x.

The total amount of ingredients in the jar is 10 ounces. The total amount of ingredients can be expressed as the sum of the amounts of salt, oil, fragrance, citrus zest, and sugar. Since the amount of salt is 2x and the amount of sugar is also 2x, the total amount of salt and sugar is 4x. The amount of oil is 4x, and the amount of fragrance and citrus zest is 2x. 

So, the equation becomes: 4x + 4x + 2x + 2x = 10

Combine like terms: 12x = 10

Divide both sides by 12: x = 10/12 = 5/6

Now that we know the value of x, we can find the amount of oil by multiplying it by 4: 4 * (5/6) = 20/6 = 10/3

The final answer is 10/3."
"To find the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 goats at $500 each is 3 x $500 = $1500.
The cost of 2 cows at $1500 each is 2 x $1500 = $3000.

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

Therefore, John spent $4500 at the market.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars he sells, we need to calculate 20% of 40, which is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

Now, Joe has 40 - 8 = 32 cars left after selling 20%.

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. He sold 8 cars, so he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

Finally, Joe has 32 - 16 = 16 cars left after selling and giving some to his mother.

"To find out how much each student raised, we need to subtract the amount raised by organizations from the total amount raised by the charity. 

Total amount raised by charity = $175,000
Amount raised by organizations = $50,000

Amount raised by students = Total amount raised by charity - Amount raised by organizations
Amount raised by students = $175,000 - $50,000
Amount raised by students = $125,000

Since there are 20 students, we need to divide the amount raised by students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised.

Amount raised by each student = Amount raised by students / Number of students
Amount raised by each student = $125,000 / 20
Amount raised by each student = $6,250

"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day separately, then add them together.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes

On the second day, Sandy walked for half as many hours as the first day. So, she walked for 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

Converting 4 hours to minutes: 
4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes

Now, we add the time from both days to get the total time:
480 minutes + 240 minutes = 720 minutes

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, Hunter counted 50 cars in the parking lot.

During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.

When Hunter got out of class for lunch, he realized that 1/2 of the cars had left. To find the number of cars that left, we need to calculate 1/2 of 70, which is 70 / 2 = 35.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has:

Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color and then add them together.

Let's start with the green eggs. Cindy had 5 green eggs.

Since she had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.

She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

Lastly, she had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

Therefore, Cindy had 27 eggs altogether.

Weight of the book: 4 pounds
Shipping cost per pound: $0.35
Shipping cost per mile: $0.08
Distance to the distribution center: 20 miles

Shipping cost = (Weight of the book * Shipping cost per pound) + (Distance to the distribution center * Shipping cost per mile)

"To determine how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for each week.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find the production for the fourth week, we need to know the total production for the first three weeks. 

The total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, we can subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week.

50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

Therefore, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week."

She has 20 pictures, but the firm offers installation for 10 pictures, so she needs 20 - 10 = 10 additional pictures.

Now, we can calculate the total number of additional items: 2 mirrors + 1 chandelier + 10 pictures = 13 additional items.

The cost of installation for these additional items is 13 * $15.00 = $195.00.

The cost of the standard installation is $129.00. Therefore, the total cost for Angela will be $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00."
"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to first determine how much money Anthony has. 

Since Eva has saved $20.00 and Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, Anthony has $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply Anthony's savings by 0.4. 

40% of $30.00 = 0.4 * $30.00 = $12.00

Since Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, we add the 40% to Anthony's savings to find Roy's total savings.

Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches. 

Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches. 

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). 

480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.

"To solve this problem, we first need to establish the speed of the kangaroo. Since 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours, we can calculate the speed of one kangaroo as follows:

Speed of one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 6 hours

Now, we know that each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo. Therefore, the speed of one turtle is:

Speed of one turtle = 1/2 * Speed of one kangaroo
Speed of one turtle = 1/2 * 6 hours
Speed of one turtle = 3 hours

Since there are four turtles, the total time it will take for them to travel across the highway is:

Total time = Total distance / Total speed
Since the distance remains the same, we can use the speed of one turtle to calculate the total time:

Total time = Speed of one turtle / Number of turtles
Total time = 3 hours / 4 turtles
Total time = 0.75 hours

To convert hours into minutes, we multiply by 60:

Total time (minutes) = 0.75 hours * 60 minutes/hour
Total time (minutes) = 45 minutes

Therefore, it will take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, 45 minutes to travel across the highway.

We also know that Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, we can add up the number of dishes each person made to find the total number of dishes: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140.

The total number of clay dishes they all make together is 140."

The farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each cow, and he has 3 cows. So, the total amount of milk he currently produces is 5 liters * 3 cows = 15 liters per day.

To produce 25 liters of milk a day, we need to find out how many cows are required. Let's divide the desired amount of milk (25 liters) by the amount of milk each cow produces (5 liters). 

25 liters / 5 liters per cow = 5 cows

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, he needs 5 - 3 = 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to first find the length of each glue stick that is not used.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply the original length by the fraction used: 5/6 * 12 mm = 10 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 mm - 10 mm = 2 mm.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply the original length by the fraction used: 1/3 * 12 mm = 4 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 mm - 4 mm = 8 mm.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply the original length by the fraction used: 1/2 * 12 mm = 6 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 mm - 6 mm = 6 mm.

Now, we add the lengths of the unused parts of all three glue sticks: 2 mm + 8 mm + 6 mm = 16 mm.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total amount he has and subtract it from the total cost of the items he wants to buy.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200, so the total amount he has is $5000 + $200 = $5200.

The total cost of the items he wants to buy is $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10800.

To find out how much money he still needs, we subtract the total amount he has from the total cost: $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

Gabriel still needs $5600.

"To find the change Thea received, we need to calculate the total amount she paid with the four $20 bills and subtract the cost of the hat.

The total amount she paid is 4 * $20 = $80.

The cost of the hat is $70.

Change = Total amount paid - Cost of the hat
Change = $80 - $70
Change = $10

Thea received $10 in change."
"To find out how much money Craig has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from the initial amount of money he had.

Craig initially had 2 twenty dollar bills, which is 2 * $20 = $40.

He spent $2 on each of the 6 squirt guns, so the total amount spent on squirt guns is 6 * $2 = $12.

He also spent $3 on each of the 3 packs of water balloons, so the total amount spent on water balloons is 3 * $3 = $9.

The total amount spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

Craig has $19 left."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many socks and dishes Jack and Peter have.

Since Jack collected 60 dishes and he has half times as many dishes as socks, we can find the number of socks Jack has by multiplying the number of dishes by 2. 

60 * 2 = 120 socks

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can find the number of socks Peter has by multiplying the number of socks Jack has by 2.

120 * 2 = 240 socks

Now, we know that Jack has 60 dishes and Peter has half times as many dishes as Jack. We can find the number of dishes Peter has by multiplying the number of dishes Jack has by 0.5.

60 * 0.5 = 30 dishes

Now, we can find the total number of socks and dishes they have together by adding the number of socks and dishes.

Total = 240 socks + 60 dishes + 30 dishes
Total = 240 + 90
Total = 330

The final answer is: 330"
"To find the number of students good at both math and English, we need to subtract the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at English only from the total number of students.

Number of students good at math only = 5
Number of students good at English only = 8
Total number of students = 20

Number of students good at both math and English = Total number of students - (Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at English only)
= 20 - (5 + 8)
= 20 - 13
= 7

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at both math and English.

Number of students good at math = Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at both math and English
= 5 + 7
= 12

"To find out how many groups can perform, we need to calculate the total time available for performances. 

The total time for each group is 2 minutes (getting on stage) + 6 minutes (performing) + 2 minutes (exiting) = 10 minutes.

The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. 

Subtracting the time for the intermission (10 minutes) from the total time, we get 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Now, we divide the remaining time by the time per group (10 minutes) to find out how many groups can perform: 110 / 10 = 11.

Therefore, Vicki can have 11 groups perform in the concert.

"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest earned each year and add it to the principal amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year.

The interest earned in the first year is $225.
The principal amount after the first year is $300 + $225 = $525.
The interest earned in the second year is 3/4 * $525 = $396.75.
The principal amount after the second year is $525 + $396.75 = $921.75.
The interest earned in the third year is 3/4 * $921.75 = $693.53.
The principal amount after the third year is $921.75 + $693.53 = $1615.28.

So, Brenda will have a total of $1615.28 after 3 years.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of white shirts with no collars and the number of floral shirts with no buttons.

Number of white shirts with no collars = Total number of white shirts - Number of white shirts with collars
= 40 - (Half of 40)
= 40 - 20
= 20

Number of floral shirts with no buttons = Total number of floral shirts - Number of floral shirts with buttons
= 50 - 20
= 30

Now, we can find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars.
Difference = Number of floral shirts with no buttons - Number of white shirts with no collars
= 30 - 20
= 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many trays the farmer can fill with 900 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold.

Number of trays = Total eggs / Eggs per tray
= 900 / 30
= 30 trays

Since the farmer sells each tray for $2.5, we can multiply the number of trays by the selling price to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Number of trays * Selling price per tray
= 30 * $2.5
= $75

The farmer will earn $75 if he sells all the eggs."
"To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm after the sale.

Initially, Farm X had 55 goats and Farm Y had 45 goats.

Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is 55 - 10 = 45.

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25.

Now, we add the number of goats left in both farms: 45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70.

The total number of goats left in both farms is 70."
"To find the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount spent on shoes per year by the number of pairs purchased per year.

Total amount spent per year = $2640

Average cost per pair = Total amount spent per year / Number of pairs purchased per year
= $2640 / 2
= $1320

The average cost per pair of shoes is $1320."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the green food and the red food separately.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $18 = $54.

Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, the actual cost of the red food will be $54 - $6 (2 * 3) = $48.

The total cost will be the sum of the cost of the green food and the cost of the red food: $75 + $48 = $123.

"To find the total time required to clean one-half of the rooms, we need to first calculate the total time required to clean all the rooms and then divide it by 2.

Total time to clean all rooms = Number of rooms * Time to clean each room
Total time to clean all rooms = 90 * 20 minutes
Total time to clean all rooms = 1800 minutes

Since we want to find the time to clean one-half of the rooms, we divide the total time by 2:
Time to clean one-half of the rooms = Total time to clean all rooms / 2
Time to clean one-half of the rooms = 1800 / 2
Time to clean one-half of the rooms = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
Time to clean one-half of the rooms = 900 / 60
Time to clean one-half of the rooms = 15 hours

"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year and then add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the number of homes built in the first two years, which is 2 * (12 + 36) = 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's add the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

The town will have built 144 homes over the next three years."
"To solve this problem, let's denote my age as 'x'. 

Since I am three years younger than my brother, my brother's age is x + 3.

I am 2 years older than my sister, so my sister's age is x - 2.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, which is 3(x + 3) - 1.

The sum of our ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks to have enough for all the students and some extra."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water passing through the river on the third day. 

Initially, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons. After the first day, the amount doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons. 

On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles again, so it becomes 2 * 8000 = 16000 gallons. 

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 16000 + 6000 = 22000 gallons.

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 22000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. 

Initially, there are 10 people infected. 

Day 1: 10 people infect 6 others, so the total number of infected people becomes 10 + 6 = 16.

Day 2: The 16 people from Day 1 infect 6 others each, so the total number of infected people becomes 16 + (16 * 6) = 16 + 96 = 112.

Day 3: The 112 people from Day 2 infect 6 others each, so the total number of infected people becomes 112 + (112 * 6) = 112 + 672 = 784.

Therefore, after three days, there are 784 people infected.

784"
"To find the total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela, we first need to calculate the amount of tips each of them received.

Rafaela received $20 from each of the 40 customers, so the total amount of tips she received is 20 * 40 = $800.

Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find the amount of tips Julieta received, we need to calculate 10% of Rafaela's tips and subtract it from Rafaela's total tips.

10% of $800 is 0.1 * 800 = $80. 

So, Julieta received $800 - $80 = $720.

The total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela is $800 + $720 = $1520.

The final answer is: $1520"
"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to subtract the total number of oranges she gave away from the initial number of oranges she bought.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges.
She gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, so she gave away 3 x 2 = 6 oranges.
She also gave 3 oranges to her son.

Total oranges given away = 6 (to daughters) + 3 (to son) = 9 oranges.

Now, subtract the total oranges given away from the initial number of oranges:
12 (initial oranges) - 9 (oranges given away) = 3 oranges.

Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so she earns 1/2 of a badge per month. In a year, she earns 12 * 0.5 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices she baked and sold. 

She baked 2 loaves per hour, and she baked for 5 hours (from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM). So, she baked 2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she had 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 slices * $0.50/slice = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to first determine the number of silver coins. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation:

Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Then, the number of gold coins is 'x + 30'. We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 70

Subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation gives us:

x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins:

Total coins = 70 (gold coins) + 40 (silver coins) = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to first calculate the total number of burritos given to the students. Since there were 50 students and each student was given 10 burritos, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

However, Mr. George ate 20 burritos, so we need to subtract those from the total number of burritos given to the students. 

The total number of leftover burritos is 500 - 20 = 480.

The final answer is: 480"
"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first determine the number of green and blue cars.

The rink has 12 red cars. They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so they have 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.

They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars, so they have 3 * 10 = 30 blue cars.

Now, we know the total number of cars is 75. We have already accounted for 12 red, 10 green, and 30 blue cars. 

To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total: 75 - 12 - 10 - 30 = 23.

Therefore, the rink has 23 yellow cars.

23"
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the number of books each person has. Let's say Anne has x books. Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has x + 25 books. 

We are also told that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has x + 12 books.

We know that the total number of books is 85, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 25) + (x + 12) = 85

Combine like terms:

3x + 37 = 85

Subtract 37 from both sides:

3x = 48

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 16

Now that we know Anne has 16 books, we can find the number of books Fawn has by adding 12:

Fawn has 16 + 12 = 28 books.

"To find the weight of the carrots, we need to first find the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the carrots weigh 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The final answer is: 7"
"To determine the total amount of jello Greg needs, we first need to calculate the total number of jello cups required. Since there are 30 kids and each kid needs 4 jello cups, the total number of cups needed is 30 * 4 = 120 cups.

Since a three-ounce box makes 10 cups, we need to calculate how many boxes are required to make 120 cups. To do this, we divide the total number of cups needed by the number of cups per box: 120 / 10 = 12 boxes.

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of the jello. Since each box costs $1.25, we multiply the number of boxes needed by the cost per box: 12 * $1.25 = $15.

Therefore, Greg will spend $15 on jello for his son's birthday party.

15"
"To find the total cost of the phones, we multiply the number of phones by the price per phone: 
5 phones * $700 per phone = $3500

The seller pays with $4000, so we subtract the total cost from the amount paid: 
$4000 - $3500 = $500

The seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to find out how much he spends in a month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

First, we calculate 40% of the total monthly cost: 
40% of $400 = 0.4 * $400 = $160

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide the monthly cost by 4 to find the weekly cost:
$160 / 4 = $40

Therefore, Keenan spends $40 per week.

"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day and add them together.

First, let's find out how many pieces Tobias ate on the first day. Since he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces, we can calculate it as follows:

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, Tobias ate 24 pieces on the first day.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's find out how many pieces are left after the first two days. We subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total:

60 - 24 - 10 = 26

Now, let's find out how many pieces Tobias ate on the third day. Since he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces, we can calculate it as follows:

7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14

So, Tobias ate 14 pieces on the third day.

Now, let's add up the pieces eaten on each day:

24 + 10 + 14 = 48

Tobias has eaten 48 pieces so far.

"To find out how much money David has left, we need to first calculate the total cost of the bolts. 

The cost of one bolt is $0.03. Since David wants to buy 16 bolts, the total cost will be 16 * $0.03 = $0.48.

Now, we subtract the total cost of the bolts from the amount of money David has: $12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00.

David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts."
"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours, we need to calculate her hourly rate of pay. 

First, we divide the amount she earned ($33) by the number of hours she worked (3 hours). 

$33 ÷ 3 hours = $11 per hour

Now, we multiply her hourly rate by the number of hours she will work (12 hours). 

$11 per hour × 12 hours = $132

So, Ella would earn $132 after 12 hours of dog walking.

132"
"To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow the order of operations.

First, we add the marbles Paul initially had to the marbles his friend gave him: 52 + 28 = 80.

Then, we calculate 1/4 of the total marbles Paul had after receiving the marbles from his friend: 1/4 * 80 = 20.

Now, we subtract the marbles Paul lost from the total: 80 - 20 = 60.

So, Paul has 60 marbles left.

"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points from each type of question and add them together.

For multiple-choice questions: 
There are 10 questions, and she answers 80% of them correctly. 
80% of 10 is 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions answered correctly.
Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, her score from multiple-choice questions is 8 points.

For true/false questions: 
There are 20 questions, and she answers 90% of them correctly. 
90% of 20 is 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions answered correctly.
Since each true/false question is worth 1 point, her score from true/false questions is 18 points.

For long-answer questions: 
There are 5 questions, and she answers 60% of them correctly. 
60% of 5 is 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions answered correctly.
Since each long-answer question is worth 5 points, her score from long-answer questions is 3 * 5 = 15 points.

Now, we add the scores from each type of question to find Amy's total score: 
8 (multiple-choice) + 18 (true/false) + 15 (long-answer) = 41 points.

"To determine the cost of the chicken Isaias bought, we first need to find out how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he plans to sell 3/5 of his 300 chickens, we can calculate this as follows:

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Since he plans to sell these 180 chickens at $50 each, the total revenue from selling these chickens will be:

180 * $50 = $9000

However, Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. To find the total cost of the chickens, we need to subtract the desired profit from the total revenue:

$9000 - $2000 = $7000

Now, to find the cost of one chicken, we divide the total cost by the number of chickens:

$7000 / 180 = $38.89

So, Isaias bought the chicken he took to the market for approximately $38.89.

The final answer is: $38.89"
"To find out how many glasses Micah sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by the boys (Micah and Mitchell) by 2, since they sold an equal number of glasses. 

Total glasses sold by the boys = 32 - 14 (Julie's sales) = 18 glasses
Number of glasses sold by each boy = 18 / 2 = 9 glasses

Now, we can find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah by subtracting Micah's sales from Julie's sales.
Difference in sales = Julie's sales - Micah's sales = 14 - 9 = 5 glasses

The final answer is: 5"

The total amount Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"To determine how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to calculate the cost of the new rope and subtract it from the amount she has.

The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and it is 20 meters long. 

Cost of the new rope = 20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30

Sarah's friend is selling the rope to her for $2 per meter. 

Selling price of the rope = 20 meters * $2/meter = $40

To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the selling price of the rope.

Money left over = Selling price - Cost of the new rope

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Melanie's current age. 

Since Melanie will be 18 years old in 10 years, her current age is 18 - 10 = 8 years.

Now, we need to find the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age. 

Let's denote the number of years as 'x'. 

We can set up the equation: 8 + x = 3 * 8

Simplifying the equation: 8 + x = 24

Subtracting 8 from both sides: x = 16

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart.

First, we know that 5 packs of bacon cost $10. Since each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, the cost of each pack of chicken is $10 * 2 = $20. Therefore, 6 packets of chicken cost 6 * $20 = $120.

Next, we know that 3 packs of strawberries cost $4 each, so the total cost of strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

Lastly, 7 packs of apples cost half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. Therefore, the total cost of apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart: $10 (bacon) + $120 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $156.

Since Kelly's budget is $65, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget to find out how much money she has left: $65 - $156 = -$91.

However, since we cannot have a negative amount of money, this indicates that Kelly does not have enough money in her budget to buy all the items in her cart."

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the speeds of the whirligig, thingamabob, and whatchamacallit. 

We know that a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. If we let the speed of the thingamabob be x, then the speed of the whatchamacallit is 11x.

We are also given that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. So, we can set up the equation 11x = 121 to find the speed of the thingamabob.

Solving for x, we get x = 121 / 11 = 11 meters per second.

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which spins five times faster than the thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the whirligig is 5 * 11 = 55 meters per second.

The final answer is 55."
"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot, we need to first determine the cost of the yogurt. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

Ellen pays $6 for the salad and $3 for the yogurt, which totals $9. Since she pays $11 in total, the remaining amount she spends on carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.

To find out how much she pays for one carrot, we divide the remaining amount by the number of carrots she eats, which is 2. So, $2 / 2 = $1.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much Tasha made from mowing lawns. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of times Tasha mowed lawns is 3x + 5x = 8x.

Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and we know that she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times, we can set up the equation 6x = 6. 

Solving for x, we get x = 1.

So, Tasha mowed Joe's lawn once, Kamala's lawn three times, and Alba's lawn five times. 

The total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns is 6x = 6 * 1 = $6.

Now, we know that Tasha made $80 in total and $6 from mowing lawns. 

The amount she made from lemonade sales is 80 - 6 = $74.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many notebooks Joseph had initially. Since Martha had 7 notebooks and she had 3 times as many as Joseph, we can set up the equation:

Martha's notebooks = 3 * Joseph's notebooks
7 = 3 * Joseph's notebooks

To find Joseph's notebooks, we divide both sides by 3:

Joseph's notebooks = 7 / 3
Joseph's notebooks = 2.33 (approximately)

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. To do this, we subtract Joseph's notebooks from Martha's notebooks:

"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we need to first calculate the distance Anis rowed. 

Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis' distance as follows:

Anis' distance = Dijana's distance + (1/5 * Dijana's distance)
Anis' distance = 50 + (1/5 * 50)
Anis' distance = 50 + 10
Anis' distance = 60

Now, we can find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis by adding their individual distances:

Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis' distance
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110

The total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis on that day is 110 miles."

"To find the average price per ticket, we need to divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets purchased. 

Deepa has seen each movie 3 times, so she has purchased 9 * 3 = 27 tickets. 

The total amount spent is $216. 

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
= $216 / 27
= $8

The average price per ticket is $8."
"To find Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total hours in a day and subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

There are 24 hours in a day. 

Harold sleeps for 10 hours, so he has 24 - 10 = 14 hours left.

He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

He walks his dog for 1 hour.

Now, let's subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog from the total hours in a day: 
24 - 10 - 8 - 1 = 5

Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day.

"To find the number of red and blue shoe boxes left, we need to calculate the number of red and blue shoe boxes used for fishing and subtract that from the initial number of each.

For blue shoe boxes: 
Initial number of blue shoe boxes = 7
Number of blue shoe boxes used = 3
Number of blue shoe boxes left = 7 - 3 = 4

For red shoe boxes: 
Initial number of red shoe boxes = 9
Number of red shoe boxes used = 1/3 * 9 = 3
Number of red shoe boxes left = 9 - 3 = 6

So, the number of red shoe boxes left is 6 and the number of blue shoe boxes left is 4.

"To find out how many books Joseph currently has, we need to first determine how many books he had initially. Since Joseph had twice the number of Sarah's books, and Sarah has 9 books, Joseph initially had 2 * 9 = 18 books.

However, Joseph lost 2 books, so we need to subtract 2 from the initial number of books he had. 

18 - 2 = 16

Joseph currently has 16 books."
"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to first calculate how many marbles he gave away. 

He gave 1/5 of 30 marbles to Jamie, which is (1/5) * 30 = 6 marbles. 

Then, he gave 10 marbles to Donald. 

So, the total number of marbles Dean gave away is 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

Now, we subtract the marbles given away from the total number of marbles Dean initially had: 30 - 16 = 14.

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We are given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be expressed as:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

We are also given that Duncan's current age is 60. So, D = 60.

Substituting D = 60 into the equation, we get:

60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)
52 = 2A - 8

Now, let's solve for A:

52 + 8 = 2A
60 = 2A
A = 30

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

A + 8 = 30 + 8
A + 8 = 38

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total number of acres, we need to first calculate the size of Farmer Smith's farm. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's farm. Since Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, twice that would be 2 * 200 = 400 acres. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than that, so it is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we add the acres of both farms together: 200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The two farms have 700 acres together."
"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to first determine how many packages he completes in that time. 

Since he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, we can calculate the number of packages he completes in an 8-hour workday as follows:

50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour
40 packages/hour * 8 hours = 320 packages

Now, we can calculate his earnings for the day:

320 packages * $0.20/package = $64

The final answer is: $64"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time John spends on both the normal and extreme sudoku puzzles. 

First, we calculate the time for the normal sudoku: 45 minutes. 

Since the extreme sudoku takes 4 times as long, the time for the extreme sudoku is 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Now, we add the time for both puzzles: 45 + 180 = 225 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to divide the total time by 30 minutes to find out how many bottles he drinks: 225 / 30 = 7.5.

So, John drinks 7.5 bottles of water.

7.5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons. Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and there are 20 red balloons, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

We know that Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna at the bundle of red and yellow balloons. Since 40 pieces were thrown at the red balloons, the remaining pieces must have been thrown at the yellow balloons. 

So, the number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons is 58 - 40 = 18.

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons can be calculated by dividing the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons by 3. 

Number of yellow balloons = 18 / 3 = 6.

Therefore, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

"To determine the number of tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in 30 days. 

Since Jon drives 100 miles a day, the total miles driven in 30 days is 100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles.

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find the number of tune-ups needed.

3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in 30 days.

3"
"To find the total hours worked by Bruce in the three days, we need to calculate the hours worked each day.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.
On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours worked each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find out how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent on the cake, balloons, and ice cream.

The cost of the cake is $11.
The cost of 1 dozen balloons is 12 * $0.5 = $6.
The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total amount of money spent is $11 + $6 + $14 = $31.

Since Julia and Nadine were given the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount spent by 2 to find out how much each of them received.

$31 / 2 = $15.50.

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $15.50.

15.50"
"To find the total number of pieces of fruit Kira bought, we need to add the number of apples, bananas, and oranges.

3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14

6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 16 (soccer) + 22 (soccer) = 56

There are 56 students in total."
"To calculate the total profit, we need to first find the total number of lollipops sold, then calculate the total revenue, and finally subtract the total cost of the lollipops.

Total number of lollipops sold = Number of students * Number of lollipops sold per student
Total number of lollipops sold = 30 * 10
Total number of lollipops sold = 300

Total revenue = Total number of lollipops sold * Price per lollipop
Total revenue = 300 * $0.8
Total revenue = $240

Total cost of lollipops = Total number of lollipops sold * Cost per lollipop
Total cost of lollipops = 300 * $0.5
Total cost of lollipops = $150

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost of lollipops
Profit = $240 - $150
Profit = $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and then add them together.

Larry has 3 cats.
He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 x 3 = 9 dogs.
He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 x 7 = 21 fish.
He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 1/3 x 21 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets.

The total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"To determine how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices each person can eat per day and then divide the total number of slices in the loaf by the combined daily consumption.

Abby can eat 2 slices a day, and Josh can eat twice as much, so Josh can eat 2 x 2 = 4 slices a day.

Combined daily consumption: 2 (Abby) + 4 (Josh) = 6 slices per day.

Now, divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the combined daily consumption (6):

24 slices / 6 slices per day = 4 days.

The loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"To find the total number of shells Martha has collected, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and now she is 10 years old, the number of months she has been collecting shells is 10 - 5 = 5 years.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of months she has been collecting shells is 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

Since Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she has collected is 60 months * 1 shell/month = 60 shells.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we first need to determine the total number of cups of mint tea. Since Lana brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea, and she has 27 cups in total, the number of cups of mint tea is 27 - 15 = 12.

Since she divides the cups into 3 rows, and each row has an equal number of cups of mint tea, we can divide the total number of cups of mint tea by 3 to find the number of cups in each row. 

12 / 3 = 4

Therefore, there are 4 cups of mint tea in each row."
"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick per trip, we need to first determine the total number of trips he can make in 8 hours. 

Since it takes the sloth 4 hours to make a round trip, we divide the total available time (8 hours) by the time taken for a round trip (4 hours). 

8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips

Since the sloth can make 2 trips in 8 hours, and he wants to collect 24 berries, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips.

24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip

Therefore, the sloth needs to pick 12 berries per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in the tank after 6 days.

Initially, the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, which is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Since the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, after 6 days, the amount of water in the tank will be:

5000 - (500 * 6) = 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

The final answer is: 2000"
"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying popcorn and candy.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He has already spent $8 on popcorn (2 tubs) and $8 on candy (4 boxes), so he has $150 - $8 - $8 = $134 left.

Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10. We need to find out how many $10 tickets Colby can buy with $134. 

$134 / $10 = 13.4

Since Colby can't buy a fraction of a ticket, he can buy 13 tickets. 

Now, we need to subtract the cost of the tickets from the remaining money. 

13 * $10 = $130

$134 - $130 = $4

Colby has $4 left. Since tickets for any other day cost $7, he can buy 4 / $7 = 0.57 (round down to 0 since he can't buy a fraction of a ticket) or 0 tickets on other days.

In total, Colby can see 13 movies.

Final answer: 13"
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, we can calculate the total calories of the pastries:

200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked is 85,000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed and then divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs per day. Since there are two days, the total for Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 * 2 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs

Total days = 5

Average Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Total days
= 300 / 5

The final answer is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus traveled at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 300 miles

The car traveled at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 8 hours
Distance = 240 miles

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:
Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car
Difference = 300 miles - 240 miles
Difference = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find the number of bouncy balls in the tube, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie already had from the total number of toys she now has. 

First, we add up the number of toys she already had: 31 blocks + 8 stuffed animals + 9 rings = 48 toys.

Now, we subtract the total number of toys she already had from the total number of toys she now has: 62 - 48 = 14.

Therefore, the tube of bouncy balls contains 14 bouncy balls.

"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as A, and Jean's age as J.

We are given the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: P + A + J = 100
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: A = J + 10
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: P = A + J

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to get: P = (J + 10) + J
Simplifying this, we get: P = 2J + 10

Now, we can substitute the expression for P into the first equation: (2J + 10) + A + J = 100
Substituting A = J + 10 into this equation, we get: (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms: 4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides: 4J = 80
Divide by 4: J = 20

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age: A = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
And finally, we can find Peter's age: P = A + J = 30 + 20 = 50

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons each person had and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, each of Maria's 4 friends had 2 balloons, so the total number of balloons they had is 4 * 2 = 8.

Maria had 2 balloons for herself.

Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (4 friends + Maria), the total number of balloons given by Maria's mom is 5 * 3 = 15.

Now, we add the initial balloons (8) to the additional balloons (15) to find the total number of balloons: 8 + 15 = 23.

Therefore, the total number of balloons the girls had is 23.

"To determine the total number of boxes of stuff, we need to calculate the total number of boxes donated and the existing boxes.

Donated boxes: 10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes
Existing boxes: 10 boxes

Total boxes: 50 boxes + 10 boxes = 60 boxes

Since each table can hold 2 boxes, we divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find the total number of tables needed.

Total tables needed: 60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

Since they already have 15 tables, we subtract the existing tables from the total tables needed to find the number of new tables required.

New tables needed: 30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables

The charity group needs 15 new tables."
"To find the total distance each person spat, we need to multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed was spat.

Zoey's total distance = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet
Sydney's total distance = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet

To find the average total distance, we need to add the total distances and divide by 2.

Average total distance = (Zoey's total distance + Sydney's total distance) / 2
= (400 + 420) / 2
= 820 / 2
= 410 feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine the difference in earnings between the two machines, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month and then multiply that by the selling price of each widget.

The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour and runs for 24 hours a day. In a month with 30 days, it will produce:
60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets

The WidgetMaster 9000 produces 45 widgets per hour and runs for 24 hours a day. In a month with 30 days, it will produce:
45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Since each widget sells for $6, the total earnings from the Widgeteer 3000 will be:
43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

The total earnings from the WidgetMaster 9000 will be:
32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $192,000

To find the difference in earnings, subtract the earnings from the WidgetMaster 9000 from the earnings of the Widgeteer 3000:
$259,200 - $192,000 = $67,200

Therefore, Fern will make $67,200 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000 in a month."
"To determine the amount of money Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of the 12-hour stay and the cost of the extended stay.

The 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos. 

Since Cameron wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, he will be staying for 5 hours beyond the 12-hour mark. 

The cost of the additional 5 hours is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.

The total cost of the extended stay is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

The cost of the 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

Cameron would save 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos by choosing the extended stay option.

"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to calculate the amount each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Sheep's hay = 2 * Goat's hay - 3
Sheep's hay = 2 * 5 - 3
Sheep's hay = 10 - 3
Sheep's hay = 7

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

Total hay for goats = Number of goats * Goat's hay
Total hay for goats = 15 * 5
Total hay for goats = 75

Total hay for sheep = Number of sheep * Sheep's hay
Total hay for sheep = 12 * 7
Total hay for sheep = 84

Now, we can find the total amount of hay needed by adding the hay for goats and sheep:

Total hay needed = Total hay for goats + Total hay for sheep
Total hay needed = 75 + 84
Total hay needed = 159

"To find out how much money John has left after buying the pencils, we need to calculate his earnings first. 

John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left.

He also buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so the total cost of the pencils is 5 * 10 = 50 dollars.

After buying the pencils, John has 250 - 50 = 200 dollars left.

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has 200 - 100 = 100 dollars left.

To find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy, we divide the remaining amount by 25. 100 / 25 = 4.

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to first determine how many bottles she gave out. Since there are 29 pupils and each pupil received 2 bottles of apple juice, the total number of bottles given out is 29 * 2 = 58.

The teacher had 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles she had initially is 9 * 100 = 900.

To find out how many bottles the teacher has left, we subtract the number of bottles given out from the total number of bottles she initially had: 900 - 58 = 842.

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the costs into the fixed charge, labor, and parts.

The fixed charge is $40. 

The labor charge is calculated by multiplying the number of hours worked (2.25) by the hourly rate ($35). Since the rate is per hour, we can round down to 2 hours for simplicity, as the rate is charged per hour or part thereof. 

Labor charge = 2 hours * $35/hour = $70

The total labor charge is $70.

The total cost is the sum of the fixed charge, labor charge, and parts. 

Total cost = $40 (fixed charge) + $70 (labor charge) + $60 (parts) = $170

"To find out how much James was out, we need to calculate the total cost of the CDs and then subtract the amount he received from selling 5 of them.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs:
10 CDs * $15 per CD = $150

Since James got them for 40% off, we need to calculate the discount:
40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60

So, the total cost of the CDs after the discount is:
$150 - $60 = $90

Now, let's calculate the amount James received from selling 5 CDs:
5 CDs * $40 per CD = $200

Since James initially spent $90, we need to subtract the amount he received from selling the CDs:
$90 - $200 = -$110

However, since James is out of money, we need to consider the initial cost of the CDs and the amount he received from selling 5 CDs. The correct calculation is:
$150 (initial cost) - $200 (amount received) = -$50

James is out $50.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's calculate the distance James swims at 2 miles per hour. Since he swims 60% of the total distance, we can calculate the distance he swims as follows:

Distance = 20 miles * 0.6 = 12 miles

Now, let's calculate the time it takes James to swim 12 miles at 2 miles per hour:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

After swimming 12 miles, James rests for half as long as the swimming time. So, he rests for:

Rest time = 6 hours / 2
Rest time = 3 hours

Now, let's calculate the remaining distance James needs to swim:

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance swum
Remaining distance = 20 miles - 12 miles
Remaining distance = 8 miles

Since James swims at half the speed, his new speed is:

New speed = 2 miles per hour / 2
New speed = 1 mile per hour

Now, let's calculate the time it takes James to swim the remaining 8 miles at 1 mile per hour:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

Now, let's add up the time James spent swimming, resting, and swimming again:

Total time = Swimming time + Rest time + Swimming time
Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 17 hours

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to first calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

Since the bakery has 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had, we subtract 40 from 490. 

490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"To find out how many stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to calculate the total number of stickers she has after the events.

Initially, Jasmine had 15 stickers. She lost 7 stickers during playtime, so she had 15 - 7 = 8 stickers left.

Then, her teacher gave her 5 more stickers for helping her classmates. So, she now has 8 + 5 = 13 stickers.

The final answer is 13."
"To calculate the total commission, we need to first calculate the total revenue from the sales of each newspaper and then multiply it by the respective commission rates.

The total revenue from the sales of 6 copies of the New York Times is 6 * $5 = $30.
The total revenue from the sales of 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal is 10 * $15 = $150.

Now, we can calculate the commission for each newspaper:
- Commission from the New York Times: $30 * 10% = $30 * 0.10 = $3
- Commission from the Wall Street Journal: $150 * 8% = $150 * 0.08 = $12

The total commission is the sum of the commission from each newspaper: $3 + $12 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given about the relationships between the ages of Marcus, Leo, and Deanna.

We know that Deanna is 26 years old. Since Marcus is half of Leo's age, we can represent Marcus's age as x and Leo's age as 2x. We also know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so we can write the equation:

x = 26 - 5
x = 21

Now that we know Marcus's age, we can find Leo's age by multiplying x by 2:

Leo's age = 2x
Leo's age = 2 * 21
Leo's age = 42

The final answer is: 42"
"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Dinar. 

Let's denote the points scored by Dinar as 'x'. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati scored x + 10 points. 

We know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Azibo scored (x + 10) - 20 points. 

The total points scored by all three is 45. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 10) + (x + 10 - 20) = 45.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 3x - 0 = 45.

Solving for x, we get: 3x = 45, x = 15.

Now that we know Dinar scored 15 points, we can find out how many points Azibo scored: Azibo scored (15 + 10) - 20 = 5 points.

"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book.

Since each paper is printed on both sides, there are 2 pages per inch. 

Now, we multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book: 
2 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 3 pages

The book contains 3 pages."
"To find the total number of reports stapled, we need to calculate the total minutes Vince worked and then divide it by the time it takes him to staple 30 reports.

Vince worked from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. 

15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we can divide the total minutes by 15 to find the total number of sets of 30 reports.

900 minutes / 15 minutes/set = 60 sets

Since each set contains 30 reports, we multiply the number of sets by 30.

60 sets * 30 reports/set = 1800 reports

Therefore, Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether.

1800"
"To find the total minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she woke up early to go to the bathroom.

First, let's calculate the time she was asleep. She usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. However, she woke up 5 minutes early to go to the bathroom, so we need to subtract those 5 minutes from her usual wake-up time.

Her usual wake-up time is 6 a.m., and she woke up 5 minutes early, so her wake-up time that day was 5:55 a.m.

Now, let's calculate the time she was asleep. She went to sleep at 10 p.m. and woke up at 5:55 a.m. We need to convert both times to minutes.

10 p.m. is 10 * 60 = 600 minutes before 12 a.m.
5:55 a.m. is 5 * 60 + 55 = 355 minutes after 12 a.m.

Now, we can calculate the total time she was asleep:
600 minutes (before 12 a.m.) + 355 minutes (after 12 a.m.) = 955 minutes

However, we also need to account for the time she was sleepwalking. She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

Now, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking from the total time she was asleep:
955 minutes - 23 minutes = 932 minutes

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for 932 minutes that day."
"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan initially has. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has 2 dozen cups, we need to convert the number of cups to a numerical value.

Two dozen cups is equal to 2 * 12 = 24 cups.

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we multiply the number of cups by 2/3 to find the number of measuring spoons:

24 * (2/3) = 16 measuring spoons

Jonathan initially had 16 measuring spoons. After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, he is left with:

16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons

Jonathan also has 24 measuring cups. Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

10 measuring spoons + 24 measuring cups = 34 utensils

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the total number of occupied beds initially, we need to calculate 1/5 of 1000 beds.

1/5 of 1000 beds = (1/5) * 1000 = 200 beds

So, the hospital initially has 200 occupied beds.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the number of occupied beds increases by 50 each day.

In 2 weeks (14 days), the number of occupied beds will be:
200 + (50 * 14) = 200 + 700 = 900 beds

Now, to find the total number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the number of occupied beds from the total capacity:
1000 - 900 = 100 beds

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we first need to determine the total number of non-work emails she sends. 

She sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the non-work emails are to her family, which means she sends 2/3 * 9 = 6 emails to her family.

The remaining non-work emails are to her boyfriend. Since 6 emails are to her family, the number of emails to her boyfriend is 9 - 6 = 3.

Therefore, Robyn sends 3 emails a day to her boyfriend.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

We know that Aliya is 3 years old. Since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we can calculate Shawna's age by multiplying Aliya's age by 3.

Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9

Now, we know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. To find Shawna's father's age, we multiply Shawna's age by 5.

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45

The final answer is 45."
"To find the correct number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from Courtney's number.

First, let's find 20% of 48: 
20% of 48 = 0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from Courtney's number:
48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the correct number of people who attended the concert is 38.4."
"To solve this problem, we can start by identifying the relationship between the number of balls each boy picked up. 

Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, and Jason carried 2 balls, we can determine that Jeffrey carried half the number of balls that Jason did. 

So, Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, we can determine that Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

Therefore, the coach brought 7 balls to practice.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day. 

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes on the third day, so the actual number of holes dug on the third day is 8 - 2 = 6.

The total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 6 = 29.

Since the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, the total number of holes dug by the end of the fourth day is 4 * 29 = 116.

The number of holes dug on the fourth day can be found by subtracting the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day from the total number of holes dug by the end of the fourth day. 

So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 116 - 29 = 87.

The final answer is: 87"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many corn chips Collins received. Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 15 more than the number the others got, Collins must have received 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, we know that the total number of corn chips is the sum of what Amora, Lainey, and Collins received. So, the total number of corn chips is 70 + 70 + 85 = 225.

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the cost of the travel, we need to calculate 50% of the cost of the supplies and add it to the cost of the supplies. 

50% of $400 is 0.5 * $400 = $200. 

The total cost of the travel is $400 (supplies) + $200 (50% of supplies) = $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of Pokémon caught is 339: A + S + X = 339
2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan: X = S + 5
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe: S = 4A - 13

We can substitute the expression for X from the second equation into the first equation:
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
Combine like terms:
A + 2S + 5 = 339

Now, substitute the expression for S from the third equation into the above equation:
A + 2(4A - 13) + 5 = 339
Expand and simplify:
A + 8A - 26 + 5 = 339
Combine like terms:
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide both sides by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

The final answer is 147."
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to divide the total minutes per episode by 2, since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. 

Total minutes per episode = 20 minutes
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the total number of episodes by the length of each episode.

Total time = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time = 10 * 20
Total time = 200 minutes

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the total distance traveled by the bird, we need to calculate the distance covered in each leg of the journey and then sum them up.

The bird travels 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the first leg is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 10 = 300 miles

The bird then travels 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the second leg is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 18 * 2 = 36 miles

The bird then travels 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the third leg is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 22 * 5 = 110 miles

To find the total distance, we add the distances covered in each leg:
Total Distance = 300 + 36 + 110 = 446 miles

However, since the bird ends up at her southern home, we need to consider the net displacement. The bird traveled 300 miles south and then 36 miles north, and then 110 miles south. The net displacement is the sum of the distances traveled south:
Net Displacement = 300 + 110 = 410 miles

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 410 miles.

The final answer is: 410"
"To find the total number of brownies Greta had, we need to calculate the number of brownies she received and subtract the number eaten.

She initially made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies, which is 12 brownies.

At her office party, she received 1/2 a dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies.

Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting, which is 48 brownies.

During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

Now, let's add up the total number of brownies she received: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

Then, subtract the number eaten: 66 - 18 = 48 brownies.

So, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day.

48"
"To find the total age of the family members, we need to calculate the age of each member.

Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 8 * 2 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. To find her age, we multiply Nani's age by 0.75 (which is 75% in decimal form). So, her age is 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we add up the ages of all three family members: 8 (Nani) + 16 (brother) + 6 (sister) = 30 years.

The total age of the family members is 30 years.

"To calculate the total cost, we need to consider the price of the first two phones and the discounted price of the remaining phones.

The first two phones cost $600 each, so the total cost for these two phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.

The remaining phones are 3 in total (John and his 2 kids), and each one is half the price of the first two phones, which is $300. 

The total cost for the remaining phones is 3 * $300 = $900.

Now, we add the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones: $1200 + $900 = $2100.

Therefore, John paid $2100 for all the phones.

"To find the total number of players in both teams, we need to add the number of players in Zeke's team to the number of players in Carlton's team.

Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, we can represent the number of players in Zeke's team as 13 + 7 = 20.

Now, we add the number of players in both teams: 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33.

The total number of players in both teams is 33."
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

Given that the length (l) is 15 feet and the width (w) is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(15) + 2(10)
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

50 * 2 = 100

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats for his fence.

"To find the total number of states in both countries, we need to first determine the number of states in the USA and India.

The USA has 50 states.

Since India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we can calculate the number of states in India as follows:

Half of 50 states is 25 states.
4 more than 25 states is 25 + 4 = 29 states.

Now, we can find the total number of states in both countries by adding the number of states in the USA and India:

50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79

The total number of states in both countries is 79."
"To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy. 

The total cost of the items is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has saved $14, he still needs $39 - $14 = $25 to afford the books.

Given that Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can calculate the number of hours he needs to work by dividing the amount he needs ($25) by his hourly wage ($5).

$25 ÷ $5 = 5 hours.

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we first need to determine how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 30 cherries and 10 more than Richard, we can calculate Richard's share by subtracting 10 from Robert's share.

Richard's share = Robert's share - 10
Richard's share = 30 - 10
Richard's share = 20

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting Richard's share from the total number of cherries.

Jerry's share = Total cherries - Richard's share
Jerry's share = 60 - 20
Jerry's share = 40

To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract Jerry's share from Robert's share.

Difference = Robert's share - Jerry's share
Difference = 30 - 40
Difference = -10

Since we are looking for the difference in the number of cherries, we take the absolute value of the difference.

Difference = | -10 |
Difference = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of boxes sold for each type of dessert on both days and then multiply the number of boxes by the price per box.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. Since he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread on Sunday, he sold 10 - 4 = 6 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

On Sunday, he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread and 6 + 15 = 21 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each type of dessert:

Gingerbread: 10 boxes * $6 = $60
Apple pie: 21 boxes * $15 = $315

Total earnings for two days: $60 + $315 = $375

"To solve this problem, let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

We are given the following information:

1. Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = D/2.
3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B.

From the first equation, we can find D: D = 24 * 2 = 48.

From the second equation, we can find B: B = 24 / 2 = 12.

Now, we have the current ages of Emil, his dad, and his brother: E = 19, D = 48, and B = 12.

The sum of their ages is E + D + B = 19 + 48 + 12 = 79.

"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads each person gave her and then add them together.

Her mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."

"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of students in each group and then add them together.

First, we find the number of football players: 20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after removing the football players: 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, we find the number of cheerleaders or band members: 25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Finally, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders/band members together: 6 + 6 = 12 students.

Therefore, 12 students are leaving early.

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. 

Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

To find the average size, we add the sizes of both pairs and divide by 2. 

Average size = (5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

The average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15."
"To determine the total cost of the flowers, we first need to calculate the total space required for the flowers and the space left between them. 

Since Pat's flower bed is 111 feet long, we need to convert this to inches for consistency. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 111 feet is equal to 111 * 12 = 1332 inches.

Each flower is 12 inches wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (18 inches) between each flower. This means that the total space required for each flower and the space between it and the next flower is 18 inches.

Now, we can calculate the total number of spaces required for the flowers. Since Pat already owns 17 flowers, we need to add 1 more space for the last flower. So, the total number of spaces is 17 + 1 = 18.

The total space required for the flowers and the spaces between them is 18 * 18 inches = 324 inches.

Now, we subtract the total space required from the total length of the flower bed to find the total space available for the flowers. 1332 - 324 = 1008 inches.

Since each flower is 12 inches wide, we can fit 1008 / 12 = 84 flowers in the flower bed.

Since each flower costs $6, the total cost of the flowers is 84 * 6 = $504.

The final answer is: $504"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to first determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. 

Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, and Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, we can calculate his brother's daily pretzel consumption as follows:

18 pretzels * 1/2 = 9 pretzels per day

To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply his daily consumption by 7:

9 pretzels per day * 7 days = 63 pretzels per week

"To determine the number of roses they can plant, we need to first calculate the total amount of soil used by the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds each = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds each = 15 pounds

Total soil used by sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds

Since they have 30 pounds of soil, the remaining amount for roses = 30 - 27 = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant = 3 pounds / 1 pound per rose = 3 roses.

"To find out how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income.

25% of $2,000.00 = 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00

Since she sets aside $500.00 each month, we can calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year by dividing her monthly savings by the cost of a pair of shoes.

Number of pairs of shoes per year = $500.00 / $1,000.00 = 0.5

Since you can't buy half a pair of shoes, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

Number of pairs of shoes per year = 0.5

The final answer is: 0"
"To determine the time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break down the problem into two parts: peeling and cooking.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. Since Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute, we can divide 90 by 6 to get the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp:

90 shrimp / 6 shrimp per minute = 15 minutes

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp. Since Emily can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can divide 90 by 30 to get the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp:

90 shrimp / 30 shrimp per 10 minutes = 3 times 10 minutes
3 x 10 minutes = 30 minutes

Since peeling and cooking are done sequentially, we add the time it takes to peel and cook the shrimp:

15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (cooking) = 45 minutes

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net cooling effect of the air conditioner.

The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. 

First, let's calculate the total cooling effect when the air conditioner is running on low for 3 hours:
3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees

Then, let's calculate the total cooling effect when the air conditioner is running on high for 4 hours:
4 hours * 3 degrees/hour = 12 degrees

The total cooling effect is the sum of these two:
6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees

However, the room will warm up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running. So, in the 2 hours after the air conditioner was turned off, the room will warm up by 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees.

To find the net cooling effect, we subtract the warming effect from the total cooling effect:
18 degrees - 4 degrees = 14 degrees

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

Final answer: 14"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as 'x'. 

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old, and the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can set up the following equation:

x + 75 = 3(30)

This equation represents the fact that Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at the time of the first sighting.

Simplifying the equation:

x + 75 = 90

Subtracting 75 from both sides:

x = 15

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks he writes per month and then multiply it by 12.

1. Checks for electric bill: 1 check per month
2. Checks for gas bill: 1 check per month
3. Checks to the church: 2 checks per month
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 4 checks per year (since there are 4 quarters in a year)

Total checks per month: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 checks
Total checks per year: 4 checks/month * 12 months/year = 48 checks/year

Buford writes 48 checks per year."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of flights made by the first plane in a day. 

Since the second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes, the first plane must make 44 * 2 = 88 trips in a day.

The first plane's flights are split between Greece, France, and Germany. It goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so it goes to Greece for 88 * (3/4) = 66 trips.

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is half of the remaining flights. The remaining flights are 88 - 66 = 22. Half of 22 is 11.

Therefore, the first plane makes 11 flights to France in a day.

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the time each wolf howls and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we need to add the time each wolf howls: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the total cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

The total cost of the trousers is $30.

To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the total cost of the trousers: $30 - $18 = $12.

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to find the average age of the group. We know the total age of the children is 20 and Akbar and Alessandro's ages are 3 and 4, respectively. 

Let's denote Helene's age as H and Wilfred's age as W. Since Helene is twice the average age of the group, we can express this as:

H = 2 * (A + A + W + H) / 4

Since we know the total age is 20, we can express this as:

A + A + H + W = 20

Substituting the known values of A and H in terms of W, we get:

3 + 4 + 2 * (3 + 4 + W) / 4 + W = 20

Simplifying the equation:

7 + 2 * (7 + W) / 4 + W = 20

Multiplying both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction:

28 + 2 * (7 + W) + 4W = 80

Expanding the equation:

28 + 14 + 2W + 4W = 80

Combine like terms:

42 + 6W = 80

Subtract 42 from both sides:

6W = 38

Divide both sides by 6:

W = 6.33

So, the age of Wilfred is approximately 6.33 years."
"To determine the amount Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to calculate the total amount of money Walter has collected so far.

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, we need to find out how much his lawyer will contribute after Walter's friend gives him $200.

Let's assume Walter's friend's contribution is x. Then, the total amount collected will be $2000 + x + 3x (since the lawyer contributes three times as much as everyone else).

We know that Walter's friend gives him $200, so the total amount collected will be $2000 + $200 + 3x = $2200 + 3x.

However, we are not given any information about Walter's friend's contribution, so we cannot determine the exact amount Walter's lawyer will contribute."
"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to calculate half of the total number of cookies brought by the guests. 

Total number of cookies = 100 guests * 15 cookies per guest = 1500 cookies

Half of the cookies = 1500 cookies / 2 = 750 cookies

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies given to the church by 15 to find the number of people in the church.

Number of people in the church = 750 cookies / 15 cookies per person = 50 people

The final answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of slices. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is 2 + 4 = 6.

Let's assume the total number of slices is x. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, we can set up the following equation:

2x = 2 * 4
2x = 8
x = 4

So, there are 4 slices in total. Since there are 2 adults, each adult gets 2 slices.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to divide the number of slices each adult gets by the total number of slices and multiply by 100:

(2/4) * 100 = 50%

Therefore, each adult gets 50% of the watermelon.

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available:
9 hours (total available) - 8 hours (total spent) = 1 hour

Therefore, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake.

Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes: 180 minutes = 3 hours

To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to subtract the total time from the serving time. 

Serving time: 5:00 pm
Total time: 3 hours

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

"To find the number of chocolate bars in a box, we need to first find the total number of boxes sold by both Lisa and Peter. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. 

Total boxes sold = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

We know that together they sold 64 chocolate bars. 

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Then, the total number of chocolate bars sold is 8x. 

Since they sold 64 chocolate bars together, we can set up the equation: 8x = 64.

To find 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 8: x = 64 / 8 = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total revenue from the lessons.

The cost of renting the studio per week is $25. Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the weekly cost is $25 * 3 = $75.

The cost of renting the studio per month is $75 * 4 = $300.

The cost of renting the studio per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the weekly cost is $1.50 * 10 = $15. The monthly cost is $15 * 4 = $60.

The total monthly cost of renting the studio is $300 + $60 = $360.

The total revenue from the lessons per week is $1.50 * 10 * 3 = $45. The monthly revenue is $45 * 4 = $180.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $180 - $360 = -$180. However, since the studio cannot have a negative earnings, this indicates that the studio is operating at a loss."
"To find the number of chocolate bars in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars each person has by the number of boxes they have.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 64 / 4 = 16.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 56 / 7 = 8.

To find the difference, subtract the number of chocolate bars in each box of Martha from the number of chocolate bars in each box of Peter: 16 - 8 = 8.

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population.

Number of female porcupines = 3/5 * 50 = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of new porcupines per month is 30 * 4 = 120.

To find the total number of new porcupines in a year, we multiply the number of new porcupines per month by 12.

Total new porcupines in a year = 120 * 12 = 1440

Now, we add the initial population of porcupines to the total number of new porcupines in a year to find the final population.

Final population = Initial population + Total new porcupines in a year
= 50 + 1440
= 1490

The final population of porcupines in the park after a year will be 1490."
"To calculate the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = length * width * depth 
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4 
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since 1 cubic foot is equal to 7.48 gallons, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.

Volume in gallons = 1400 * 7.48 
Volume in gallons = 10480 gallons

Now, we need to multiply the volume by 5.9 to find the total amount of water needed.

Total gallons = 10480 * 5.9 
Total gallons = 61920 gallons

The cost to fill the pool is calculated by multiplying the total gallons by the cost per gallon.

Cost = 61920 * 0.10 
Cost = 6192

The cost to fill the pool is $6192."
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to first determine the number of blue sticks and then the number of yellow sticks.

We know there are 9 red sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 + 14 + 11 = 34.

The total number of sticks is 34."
"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to calculate the distance each of them traveled.

Matteo's distance = speed * time = 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles

Shandy's distance = speed * time = 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles

The difference in distance = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the total number of female students, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old. Since there are 3000 students in total, half of them would be 3000 / 2 = 1500 students over 16 years old.

We are also told that one-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male. So, the number of male students over 16 years old would be 1500 / 4 = 375.

Now, we know that the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old. This means the other half of the students are 1500 / 2 = 750 students under 16 years old.

We are told that one-half of the students under 16 are male. So, the number of male students under 16 years old would be 750 / 2 = 375.

To find the total number of female students, we need to subtract the number of male students from the total number of students. 

The total number of male students is the sum of male students over 16 and under 16 years old, which is 375 + 375 = 750.

Now, subtracting the total number of male students from the total number of students, we get 3000 - 750 = 2250.

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at the school is 2250."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many laps each person can run and then compare Bethany's laps to Quinn's.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's laps from Bethany's laps: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on each day.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons. The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped over the two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the amount of water remaining for the tank to be full is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we can break it down into two parts: the first part where the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour, and the second part where it loses 7% of its capacity per hour.

Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as x.

In the first part, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour for 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:

x - (9% of x) * 5
= x - 0.09x * 5
= x - 0.45x
= 0.55x

In the second part, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity per hour for 3 hours. This means that after 3 hours, the charge remaining is:

0.55x - (7% of 0.55x) * 3
= 0.55x - 0.07 * 0.55x * 3
= 0.55x - 0.1025x
= 0.4475x

We are given that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 28%. So, we can set up the equation:

0.4475x = 0.28

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.4475:

x = 0.28 / 0.4475
x = 0.628

So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 62.8%.

The final answer is: 62.8"
"To determine the total amount Janet needs to save for the down payment, we need to calculate 20% of the car's price. 

20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

Since Janet earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips, her total hourly wage is $10 + $15 = $25.

To find out how many hours she needs to work to save $2,000, we divide the amount she needs to save by her total hourly wage:

$2,000 / $25 = 80 hours

Since Janet works 40 hours a week, we need to divide the total hours by her weekly hours to find out how many weeks she needs to work:

80 hours / 40 hours per week = 2 weeks

"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has spent on the other fruits.

He has already purchased:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.75 each: 4 * $0.75 = $3
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total amount spent so far: $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25 left. Since he can't spend a negative amount, this means he has spent more than he has. However, we can still calculate how many plums he can buy with the money he has left.

Since he has -$0.25, we can assume he actually has $0.25 left. 

Plums cost $0.25 each. 

Number of plums he can buy: $0.25 / $0.25 = 1

"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we need to first calculate the total number of sweets in the box. 

There are 15 packs in the box, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, the total number of sweets is 15 * 60 = 900.

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, which means she kept 2 * 60 = 120 pieces.

Now, we subtract the number of sweets Anne kept from the total number of sweets to find out how many sweets were given to her friends: 900 - 120 = 780.

Since Anne gave the sweets equally to her 10 friends, we divide the remaining sweets by 10: 780 / 10 = 78.

Therefore, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

"To calculate the price of carrots after three years, we need to apply the 5% annual increase to the initial price of $120 for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial price = $120
Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Initial price = $126
Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Initial price = $132.30
Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

This means each album has 9 pictures. 

Since 3 albums were selfies, the number of selfies is 3 * 9 = 27.

Since 2 albums were portraits, the number of portraits is 2 * 9 = 18.

Therefore, Olivia had 18 portraits and 27 selfies.

"To find the total number of easy questions, we can calculate 40% of 60, which is 0.4 * 60 = 24 questions. 

Since the rest of the questions are divided equally between average and difficult, we have 60 - 24 = 36 questions left. Half of these are average and half are difficult, so there are 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 0.75 * 24 = 18 questions. She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 0.5 * (18 + 18) = 18 questions.

Therefore, Aries is sure to get a total of 18 + 18 = 36 questions.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as L and the number of small stuffed animals sold as S. We know that S = 2L (since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones).

We also know that the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal, so the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total amount earned from the sales is $120. Since the price of a large stuffed animal is $12 and the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, the total amount earned from the sales can be represented as:

$12L + $4S = $120

Substituting S = 2L into the equation, we get:

$12L + $4(2L) = $120
$12L + $8L = $120
$20L = $120

Dividing both sides by $20, we get:

L = 6

Since S = 2L, we can find the number of small stuffed animals sold:

S = 2 * 6
S = 12

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 * $1 = $80.
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 * $4 = $240.

Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave away a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

Now, we subtract the amount she gave away from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

Therefore, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings.

"To find the number of eggs the friends found, we first need to determine the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins and the other individuals. 

The Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so together they found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

Since all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends, we need to subtract the 10 unaccounted eggs from the total number of eggs. 

Total eggs = 100
Eggs found by Smith twins = 60
Eggs not found by Smith twins = 100 - 60 = 40

Since all the eggs except 10 were found by their friends, the friends found 40 - 10 = 30 eggs.

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the amount of ore that 40 dwarves can mine with steel pickaxes in one day.

Since one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, 40 dwarves can mine 40 * 12 = 480 pounds of ore per day with steel pickaxes.

Since the problem states that 40 dwarves can mine 50% more ore with steel pickaxes than with iron pickaxes, we can calculate the amount of ore that 40 dwarves can mine with iron pickaxes in one day. 

Let's denote the amount of ore that one dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe as x. Then, 40 dwarves can mine 40x pounds of ore per day with iron pickaxes.

Since 40 dwarves can mine 50% more ore with steel pickaxes than with iron pickaxes, we can set up the equation:

40x + 50% of 40x = 480

Simplifying the equation, we get:

40x + 20x = 480

Combine like terms:

60x = 480

Divide both sides by 60:

x = 8

So, one dwarf can mine 8 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe.

Now, we can calculate the amount of ore that 40 dwarves can mine with iron pickaxes in one day:

40 * 8 = 320 pounds of ore per day

Since 40 dwarves can mine 50% more ore with steel pickaxes than with iron pickaxes, we can calculate the amount of ore that 40 dwarves can mine with steel pickaxes in one day:

320 + 50% of 320 = 320 + 160 = 480 pounds of ore per day

To find the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves can mine in a month with steel pickaxes, we multiply the daily amount by 30:

480 * 30 = 14400 pounds of ore per month

The final answer is: 14400"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to establish the price per sandwich based on the given information. 

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.50.

The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.50.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich remains the same for all packages. 

Now, we can calculate the price of the package with 8 sandwiches by multiplying the price per sandwich by 8: $1.50 * 8 = $12.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to calculate the remaining balance after he uses the $1000 from the sale of his old bedroom to pay for the bedroom set.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount received from selling the old bedroom: $1000
Remaining balance: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining balance per month, we can calculate the monthly payment as follows:

Monthly payment = 10% of $2000
Monthly payment = 0.10 * $2000
Monthly payment = $200

The final answer is: $200"
"To find the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons she had after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 
Number of red balloons that burst = 40% of 25 = 0.4 * 25 = 10
Number of red balloons remaining = 25 - 10 = 15

Then, she accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. 
Number of yellow balloons released = 1/2 * 12 = 6
Number of yellow balloons remaining = 12 - 6 = 6

Next, she found 8 blue balloons in the tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons. 
Number of blue balloons added = 75% of 8 = 0.75 * 8 = 6
Number of blue balloons remaining = 8 - 6 = 2 (since she found 8, but only 2 were added to her clutch)

Now, let's calculate the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school:
Number of red balloons = 15
Number of green balloons = 7
Number of yellow balloons = 6
Number of blue balloons = 2

Total number of balloons = 15 + 7 + 6 + 2 = 30

The final answer is 30."
"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the following scenarios:

1. The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 60% (100% - 40% chance of extension)
2. The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 60% (100% - 40% chance of no extension)
3. The substitute teacher comes in: 100% (no chance of extension)

Now, let's calculate the probability of each scenario:

Scenario 1: Normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36
Scenario 2: Normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24
Scenario 3: Substitute teacher comes in: 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.10

Now, we add up the probabilities of each scenario: 0.36 + 0.24 + 0.10 = 0.70

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.70 * 100 = 70%

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 70%."
"To determine the number of tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family, we need to first calculate the total number of available tickets. 

Total available seats = 6000
Seats for graduates = 950
Seats for faculty = 300

Total available tickets = Total available seats - (Seats for graduates + Seats for faculty)
Total available tickets = 6000 - (950 + 300)
Total available tickets = 6000 - 1250
Total available tickets = 4750

Since the tickets are split equally among the graduates, we need to divide the total available tickets by the number of graduates.

Number of graduates = 950

Tickets per graduate = Total available tickets / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of large, medium, and small jelly beans. 

We know that it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, the number of medium-sized beans is 2 * 75 = 150.

We also know that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean. Therefore, the number of small beans that equals 1 medium-sized bean is 3. To find the total number of small beans that equals 150 medium-sized beans, we multiply 150 by 3, which gives us 450.

So, Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly beans.

"To calculate Melissa's total earnings, we need to first calculate her total daily earnings and then subtract her parking expenses.

Total daily earnings = $15 per day
Total parking expenses = $3 per day
Total daily expenses = $15 - $3 = $12 per day

Total hours worked = 6 hours per day * 3 days = 18 hours

Total earnings = Total daily earnings * Total hours worked
Total earnings = $15 * 18
Total earnings = $270

Total expenses = Total daily expenses * Total hours worked
Total expenses = $12 * 18
Total expenses = $216

Jury pay per hour = Total earnings - Total expenses
Jury pay per hour = $270 - $216
Jury pay per hour = $54

"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can place along the driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes to move from one bottle to the next.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the width of the driveway by the spacing between the bottles:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school and the total amount of money he earned after graduating.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school. Since it takes him 4 years to finish college and he gets $50,000 in loans per year, the total amount of money he lost is:

$50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim earned after graduating. Since his college degree tripled his income, and he had a $25,000 per year job before college, his new income is:

$25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year

Since he worked for 4 years after graduating, the total amount of money he earned is:

$75,000/year * 4 years = $300,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay off the loans and the money lost while in school. This is the sum of the total amount of money he lost and the total amount of money he earned:

$200,000 (lost) + $300,000 (earned) = $500,000

To find out how long it would take Jim to earn this amount, we can divide the total amount by his new income:

$500,000 / $75,000/year = 6.67 years

Therefore, it would take Jim approximately 6.67 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

Final answer: 6.67"
"To find the total amount of fabric needed, we first need to calculate the area of the comforter. The comforter will be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, so its dimensions will be (6 + 2) feet by (8 + 2) feet, which is 8 feet by 10 feet.

The area of the comforter is calculated by multiplying its length by its width: 8 * 10 = 80 square feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we need to multiply the total area by 2 to account for both pieces: 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. 
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery. 
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Now, let's add the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday: 
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

The total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is 736."

"To find the average amount Johnny lost, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

In the first race, he lost $5.

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Since he lost $5 in the first race, he won $2 * $5 + $1 = $11 in the second race.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. Since he won $11 in the second race, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50 in the third race.

Now, let's calculate the total amount he lost: $5 (first race) + $16.50 (third race) = $21.50

To find the average amount he lost, we divide the total amount by the number of races: $21.50 / 3 = $7.17

The average amount Johnny lost that day is $7.17."

"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their new heights after the growth.

Xavier's new height: 4 feet + 3 inches = 4 feet + 3 inches = 4 feet 3 inches
Since 1 foot = 12 inches, we can convert 4 feet to inches: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches
So, Xavier's new height in inches is 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Cole's new height: 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Now, we can find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier: 
52 inches (Cole's height) - 51 inches (Xavier's height) = 1 inch

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height is 1 inch."
"To find the share of the first person, we need to first determine the amount each person took. 

Let's denote the amount the first person took as x. 

The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person took x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + 80).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 576.67

So the first person took $576.67.

"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters.

First, let's calculate the total hours worked by the team. Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks, we need to convert the fraction of the day to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8ths of a day is (3/8) * 24 = 9 hours.

Since they worked for 3 weeks, we multiply the daily hours by 3: 9 hours * 3 = 27 hours.

Now, we divide the total hours by the number of painters: 27 hours / 4 painters = 6.75 hours per painter.

The final answer is 6.75."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is 'x + 4'. 

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is 'x/2'.

We know that the total number of balls retrieved is 19. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for 'x', we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Expanding the equation:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know 'x', we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set of the match.

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010.

Year 2007: The car is worth $20,000.
Year 2008: The car depreciates by 21% of $20,000, which is $4,200. So, the car is worth $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800.
Year 2009: The car depreciates by 21% of $15,800, which is $3,306.80. So, the car is worth $15,800 - $3,306.80 = $12,493.20.
Year 2010: The car depreciates by 21% of $12,493.20, which is $2,616.928. So, the car is worth $12,493.20 - $2,616.928 = $9,876.272.

2. The pair of running shorts costs $5 more than the tank top, so it costs $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The package of athletic socks originally costs $8, but Alison had a $2 coupon, so she paid $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: $10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55.

The total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is $55."
"To calculate the total cost of renovating your kitchen floor, we need to determine the total number of tiles required. 

Since each tile is 1ft in length and your kitchen floor is 200 SqFt, we can calculate the total number of tiles needed by dividing the total area by the area of a single tile. However, since the tiles are square, we need to square the length of the tile to get the area of a single tile. 

Area of a single tile = 1ft * 1ft = 1 SqFt

Now, we can calculate the total number of tiles required:

Total tiles = Total area of kitchen floor / Area of a single tile
Total tiles = 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt
Total tiles = 200

Since each tile costs $12, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the total number of tiles by the cost per tile:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many slices each person ate and then add them up.

We know Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can set up an equation to find out how many slices Jake ate:

Let x be the number of slices Jake ate.
Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so Becky ate x + 3 slices.
We know Becky ate 10 slices, so x + 3 = 10.
Solving for x, we get x = 7.

Now that we know Jake ate 7 slices, we can find out how many slices Silvia ate. Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices each person ate:

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add the number of classes that visited each day:
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247

Therefore, a total of 247 classes visited the Science Center last week.

"To find the average score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of tests. 

First, let's add up the scores: 
100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380

Now, we divide the total score by the number of tests: 
380 / 4 = 95

The average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"To find out how many pizzas are left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas each group ate and subtract that from the total number of pizzas ordered.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 
70% of 20 pizzas is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas.
80% of 40 pizzas is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

Now, let's add the number of pizzas eaten by both groups: 14 (glee club) + 32 (football team) = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

To find out how many pizzas are left, we subtract the number of pizzas eaten from the total number of pizzas ordered: 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

"To find the total postage cost, we need to calculate the number of small and big coupons first. 

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons, so he will send out 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.

The total number of coupons is 700 + 1400 = 2100.

The cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.
The cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

The total cost of mailing is 3500 + 21000 = 26200 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 26200 / 100 = 262 dollars.

The total postage cost is 262 dollars."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

Then, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, leaving Sidney with 7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches.

Since each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining 3 sub sandwiches is 3 * 4 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of trucks that could not deliver the fertiliser, we need to calculate a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched. 

A quarter of 20 trucks is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered is 5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons.

The total number of trucks that could deliver the fertiliser is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons.

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons.

"To determine the cost of the butter, we first need to calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs. Since he needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store has a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every two pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds. 

To calculate the cost, we can divide the total amount of butter needed (6 pounds) by 2, since the promotion is for every two pounds. 6 / 2 = 3. 

Since Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds of butter for every 2 pounds, and he needs 6 pounds, he will pay for 3 sets of 1.5 pounds. 

The cost of 1.5 pounds of butter is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00. Since he is buying 3 sets of 1.5 pounds, the total cost will be 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.

The final answer is: $6.00"
"To calculate the total cost, we first need to find the number of guests. Kayla invited 25 classmates and 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members, for a total of 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests. However, 4 people said they could not come, so the actual number of guests is 45 - 4 = 41.

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. Since there are 41 guests, we need to calculate the cost for the additional guests. The number of additional guests is 41 - 20 = 21.

The cost for the additional guests is 21 * $6 = $126. Adding this to the initial fee of $125, the total cost is $125 + $126 = $251.

The final answer is: $251"
"To find out how much money Maggie and Riza have left, we need to first determine how much money they initially had. Since they each had $60, the total amount of money they had is $60 + $60 = $120.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 * $60 = $15. 
Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 * $60 = $20.

The total amount of money they spent is $15 + $20 = $35.

To find out how much money they have left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $120 - $35 = $85.

The two of them have $85 left."
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine the total number of bananas each monkey eats in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

Since the total number of bananas is 315, we can subtract the bananas eaten by the first two monkeys to find out how many bananas are left for the third monkey.

The first two monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas per day. 

315 - 24 = 291 bananas left for the third monkey.

Since the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day, the third monkey eats 291 bananas per day.

"To find the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to calculate the number of pieces he placed in the first half of the puzzle and the number of pieces he placed in the second puzzle.

Since Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle, he placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces in the first half.

In the second puzzle, he finished 500 pieces in an hour.

So, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750.

"To determine the total cost of the roses, we first need to calculate the cost of 15 roses. 

Since a dozen roses costs $15, 15 roses would cost 15 / 12 * 15 = $18.75. 

Jenny has 5 $5 bills, which is equivalent to 5 * $5 = $25. 

Now, we subtract the cost of the roses from the total amount of money Jenny has: $25 - $18.75 = $6.25.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $6.25 into quarters. 

There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so we divide $6 by 4 to get 6 / 4 = 1.5. Since we can't have half a quarter, we round down to 1 full quarter and 2 quarters (2 * $0.25 = $0.50) to make up the remaining $0.25.

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 1 quarter and 2 quarters.

1 + 2 = 3"
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the revenue from each item and add them together.

Revenue from milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50 = $33
Revenue from burger platters: 9 platters * $11 = $99
Revenue from sodas: 20 sodas * $1.50 = $30

Total revenue = $33 + $99 + $30 = $162

"To determine the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the time elapsed between the first train's arrival and the fourth train's departure.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station after 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station after 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. Since the third train leaves immediately after it arrives, it leaves the station at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the time Paul will board his train.

Now, we need to calculate the total waiting time for Paul. He waits for the first train to arrive (10 minutes), then waits for the second train to leave (60 minutes), then waits for the third train to leave (125 minutes), and finally waits for the fourth train to arrive (20 minutes). 

Total waiting time = 10 + 60 + 125 + 20 = 215 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we need to first determine how many toothpicks she has already collected. 

Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks per week for 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has collected is 10 * 12 = 120.

Since she needs 200 toothpicks in total, we subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total: 200 - 120 = 80.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks at the same rate of 10 toothpicks per week. 

To do this, we divide the remaining toothpicks by the number of toothpicks she saves per week: 80 / 10 = 8.

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we need to calculate the original price of the watch and the price at which he sold it.

Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price. Let's call the original price 'x'. 

So, the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch is 0.75x.

He then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it. So, the selling price is 1.2 * 0.75x = 0.9x.

The original price of the watch is x. The selling price is 0.9x. 

The discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend is the difference between the original price and the selling price, which is x - 0.9x = 0.1x.

To find the percentage discount, we need to divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100. 

So, the percentage discount is (0.1x / x) * 100 = 10%.

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we need to determine the rate at which the springs create jellyfish. Since every second, a spring creates a new jellyfish, we can say that each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second.

Since there are 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created per second is 5.

Now, we need to convert the time from hours to seconds. There are 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute. So, there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.

We are given that the time is 4 hours, so the total number of seconds is 4 * 3600 = 14400 seconds.

Now, we can multiply the number of jellyfish created per second (5) by the total number of seconds (14400) to get the total number of jellyfish created in 4 hours.

Total jellyfish = 5 * 14400 = 72000

Therefore, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score and then add 15 to it. 

Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180. 

Now, we add 15 to this result: 180 + 15 = 195.

So, Frankie's score was 195.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it took James to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.

Since James walked halfway to the store, that means he walked 2 miles to the store and 2 miles back home. 

The total distance he walked is 2 miles (to the store) + 2 miles (back home) = 4 miles.

Since James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the time it took him to walk the total distance:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

Therefore, it took James 1 hour to reach the store and back home.

"To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the bananas individually and the total cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's calculate the total cost of buying the bananas individually. Since there are 10 bunches with 4 bananas per bunch, the total number of bananas is 10 * 4 = 40. The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Jenny bought 10 bunches at $3.00 each, so the total cost is 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total amount of fence that Sam and Harry will get. 

Let's assume Sam gets x feet of the fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry will get x + 60 feet.

The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. 

To find out how much is left over for Sam, we subtract the amount he gets from the total length of the fence:

100 - 20 = 80

The answer is 80."
"To find the rate of growth, we need to divide the total growth (8 inches) by the number of years (4). 

8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year

Now, we can multiply the rate of growth by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

The crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply that by its price.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold: 
Half of 300 bikes were Trekking bikes, so 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold: 
15% of 300 bikes were BMX bikes, so 0.15 * 300 = 45 BMX bikes.

Now, we can find the number of MTB bikes sold: 
Since the rest of the bikes were MTB, we subtract the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total: 
300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
- 150 Trekking bikes at $450 each: 150 * 450 = $67,500
- 45 BMX bikes at half the price of MTB ($250): 45 * 250 = $11,250
- 105 MTB bikes at $500 each: 105 * 500 = $52,500

Total earnings = $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250.

The final answer is: $131,250."
"To determine the number of bales left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made and picked up in 6 hours.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

To find the number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total minutes John spends in classes, we first need to calculate the total minutes he spends in classes per week. 

There are 5 days of classes, and each class is 40 minutes long. So, the total minutes spent in classes per week is 5 * 40 = 200 minutes.

Since John also spends extra time on Saturday and Sunday, we need to calculate the extra minutes spent on these days. There are 2 days, and he spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these days. 

First, we need to find the total minutes in a week. There are 24 hours in a day, and 60 minutes in an hour. So, there are 24 * 60 = 1440 minutes in a day. 

Since John goes to school for 5 days a week, the total minutes in a week is 5 * 1440 = 7200 minutes.

Now, we can find the extra minutes spent on Saturday and Sunday. 1/16 of 7200 is 7200 / 16 = 450 minutes. 

So, the total minutes spent in classes and extra learning time per week is 200 + 450 = 650 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60. 650 / 60 = 10.83 hours.

The final answer is 10.83."
"To find the height the ball reaches on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height it reaches after the first bounce and then multiply that height by 2/3.

The initial height is 3 stories, which is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

After the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of the initial height, which is (2/3) * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of the height it reached after the first bounce, which is (2/3) * 48 = 32 feet.

Therefore, the ball reaches 32 feet on its second bounce.

"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child in inches.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 6 feet to inches by multiplying 6 by 12, which equals 72 inches.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find the total earnings, we need to divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10) to determine the number of bags sold. 

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Since each bag is sold at $5, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples."
"To find the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards from the last known amount.

The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms of meat, so the amount left before they ate was 270 kilograms.

The velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. This means the velociraptors ate half of 270 kilograms, which is 270 / 2 = 135 kilograms.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the original amount, the amount left after the T-Rex ate was 135 kilograms. To find the original amount, we need to double this amount, which is 135 * 2 = 270 kilograms.

So, the triceratops had 270 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate.

The final answer is: 540"
"To find the total area to be painted, we need to calculate the area of each wall and then sum them up. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, their combined area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of them, their combined area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

The total area to be painted is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost will be 12 x $12 = $144.

"To determine the likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the number of shaken and unshaken sodas left after Ellen's brother took his share.

Initially, Ellen had 12 sodas, shook 3, and left 9 unshaken. Her brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 9 - 2 = 7 unshaken sodas and 3 - 1 = 2 shaken sodas.

Ellen's friend can choose from the 7 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas. Since the friend can choose any of the remaining sodas, the total number of options is 7 + 2 = 9.

The probability of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas, which is 2/9.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (2/9) * 100 = 22.22%."
"To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them. 

Distance between the two trains = 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we first need to calculate the total number of days he is available to help. 

There are 31 days in March. Billy takes 20% of the days off, which is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round down to 6 days off. 

So, Billy is available to help for 31 - 6 = 25 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour, and he works for 3 hours a day. Therefore, he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

To find the total number of people he can help, we multiply the number of days he is available to help by the number of people he can help per day: 25 * 6 = 150.

12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people in the cars:
20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Now, we add the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars to find the total number of people outside the church:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the total number of people outside the church from the total number of people:
480 people - 480 people = 0 people

Since Mike is 24 years old, and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, Martha's age can be calculated as follows: 
Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Since Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, Jeff's age can be calculated as follows:

"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: Time = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide: Time = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide: 
Difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer to ride compared to the second biggest slide."
"To find the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks per day, we need to add the time for lunch and the time for breaks.

Time for lunch: 30 minutes
Time for breaks: 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes

Total time per day: 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time per day to hours by dividing by 60.

Total time per day in hours: 60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Since Bobby takes this amount of time per day for 5 days, we multiply the total time per day by 5.

Total time for 5 days: 1 hour * 5 = 5 hours

"To find out how many miles Micah ran, we need to calculate 3.5 times the distance Amber ran. 

Amber ran 8 miles. 
3.5 times 8 miles is 3.5 * 8 = 28 miles.

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We already know that Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 28 miles. 

To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the total distance run by Amber and Micah from the total distance run by all three. 
52 miles - (8 miles + 28 miles) = 52 miles - 36 miles = 16 miles.

Therefore, Ahito ran 16 miles.

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after the discounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan:
Original price: $20.00
Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Discounted price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the towels:
Original price: $30.00
Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
Discounted price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items purchased:
Cost of returned item: $15.00
Cost of frying pan: $16.00
Cost of towels: $27.00
Total cost: $15.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $58.00

Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card. To find the new balance, we subtract the cost of the returned item:
New balance: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

The new balance on her credit card is $70.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (1/3)*(x/5) = x/15.

The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue. Since the other jellyfish are small, the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We know that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means 6 jellyfish are large and change color. This implies that the number of large jellyfish is 6. 

Since the number of large jellyfish is x/5, we can set up the equation x/5 = 6 and solve for x.

x = 6 * 5
x = 30

Therefore, there are 30 jellyfish in the tank.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the age relationships between Caroline, Ben, and Chris. 

We know that Chris is 4 years old. Since Ben is two times older than Chris, we can calculate Ben's age as follows: 
Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now, we know that Caroline is three times older than Ben. So, we can calculate Caroline's age as follows:
Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we first need to calculate her annual savings and annual expenses.

Annual savings = 20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000

Annual expenses = 40% of $100,000 = 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000

Annual disposable income = Annual salary - Annual expenses = $100,000 - $40,000 = $60,000

Since Lauren wants to save for 20 years, we can calculate the total amount she needs to save:

Total savings needed = Annual savings * Number of years = $20,000 * 20 = $400,000

Now, we can calculate how many years she needs to work to save this amount:

Number of years = Total savings needed / Annual disposable income = $400,000 / $60,000 = 6.67 years

Since Lauren can't work a fraction of a year, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are asked for the number of years she needs to work, not the number of years she needs to work after retirement. 

So, Lauren needs to work for 6.67 years to save the required amount, but she will work for 20 years to achieve her goal. Therefore, she needs to work for 20 - 6.67 = 13.33 years more.

The final answer is: 13.33"
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to break down the problem into steps. 

First, we divide the 100 centimeters of ribbon into 4 equal parts. This means we divide 100 by 4, which equals 25 centimeters per part.

Next, we take each of these 4 parts and divide them into 5 equal parts. This means we divide 25 by 5, which equals 5 centimeters per final cut.

So, the length of each final cut will be 5 centimeters.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we can set up a proportion. Let's denote the total number of students as 'x'. 

Since 40% of the students are boys, and there are 240 boys, we can write the equation as follows:

40% of x = 240

To solve for x, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:

0.4x = 240

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.4 to isolate x:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

Since we want to find the number of girls, we can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

Therefore, there are 360 girls in the school.

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how much money your mom spent at the gardening shop, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then subtract the coupon discount.

First, we add the cost of the pots and the garden soil: $19 + $26 = $45.

So, your mom spent $38 at the gardening shop."
"To find the average height of heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide it by the total number of heels.

Total height of heels = (3 x 4 inches) + (3 x 2 inches) = 12 inches + 6 inches = 18 inches

Total number of heels = 3 + 3 = 6

Average height of heels = Total height of heels / Total number of heels = 18 inches / 6 = 3 inches

The average height of heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days. To find out how many miles she needs to hike per day, we divide the total miles by the number of days:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is already hiking 125 miles per day, we subtract this from the required daily amount to find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day:

310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 185 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

Final answer: 185"
"To find the total amount the store will receive, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling each color of ball and then add them together.

Red balls: 3 * $9 = $27
Blue balls: 11 * $5 = $55
Green balls: 25 * $3 = $75

Total revenue = $27 + $55 + $75 = $157

The store will have received $157 after all the balls are sold."
"To find out how much each person gets, we need to calculate the amount each person wants.

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg.

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

Since Jacques is not mentioned in the question, we can assume that Jacques is the one left with the remaining amount. 

The total amount taken by Pierre and Paul is 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

So, Jacques will have 12 - 7 = 5 kg left.

"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first determine the total amount Anna spent on the books. 

Anna started with a budget of $16 and had $2 left after buying the books. This means she spent $16 - $2 = $14 on the books.

Since she bought 2 books for the same amount, we can divide the total amount spent ($14) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

$14 ÷ 2 = $7

So, each book cost $7.

- Female goldfishes: 5

After buying:
- Male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
- Female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, we can find the difference between the number of female and male fishes:
Female fishes: 8
Male fishes: 5
Difference: 8 - 5 = 3

"To find the total time they all took to do their chores, we need to calculate the time each person took to complete their tasks.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to complete her chore, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took over 4 hours longer than Amalia to complete her chore, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, we add up the time each person took to complete their tasks: 
4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours.

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"To find the total distance driven in a month, we need to calculate the round trip distance and then multiply it by the number of times John visits his parents in a month.

The distance to his parents is 2 hours * 70 mph = 140 miles one way. Since it's a round trip, the total distance is 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles.

Since John visits his parents twice a month, the total distance driven in a month is 280 miles * 2 = 560 miles.

The final answer is: 560"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how far Brian will walk in 7 days. 

Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the distance Brian walks in 7 days as 'x'. 

Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, the distance Sofie walks in 7 days is 2x. We know that Sofie walks 10 miles every day, so the total distance she walks in 7 days is 10 * 7 = 70 miles. 

We can now set up the equation: 2x = 70. 

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 70 / 2 = 35. 

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers. 

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys per hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys. 
The 2 workers who produce 4 toys per hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys. 
The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, the total number of toys required is 200 + 20 = 220 toys.

Since 5 workers are available, and 4 of them have already produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced 220 - 200 = 20 toys.

Since the fifth worker worked for 10 hours, the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour is 20 / 10 = 2 toys per hour.

The final answer is 2."
"To find the weight of Elijah's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we add the weights of both dogs: 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

To find the total weight of both Elijah and Kory's dogs, we add the weight of Elijah's dogs to Kory's dog: 45 + 60 = 105 pounds.

The final answer is: 105"
"To solve this problem, let's work backwards from the information given.

Kris gave 7 stickers to Rob, and Kris kept 9 stickers. This means Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers initially.

Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris. Since Kris had 16 stickers, and Kris received half of the stickers from Luis, we can set up an equation: 
Let x be the number of stickers Luis received from Seth. Then, Kris received x/2 stickers from Luis. We know Kris had 16 stickers, so x/2 = 16. Solving for x, we get x = 32.

Since Luis received half of the stickers from Seth, and Luis gave half of his stickers to Kris, we can set up another equation: 
Let y be the number of stickers Seth had initially. Then, Luis received y/2 stickers from Seth. Since Luis gave half of his stickers to Kris, he had y/4 stickers left. We know Luis had 32 stickers, so y/4 = 32. Solving for y, we get y = 128.

Therefore, Seth had 128 stickers in the beginning.

"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to calculate the total weight of the large bags and then multiply it by the number of M&M's per ounce.

Each large bag weighs 10 ounces, and there are 3 large bags. So, the total weight is 3 * 10 = 30 ounces.

Since each ounce contains 30 M&M's, the total number of M&M's is 30 * 30 = 900.

John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag. To find the number of small bags, we divide the total number of M&M's by 10.

Number of small bags = Total M&M's / 10 = 900 / 10 = 90.

The final answer is 90."
"To find the number of days it will take Alfie to fly half the circumference of the earth, we need to divide the distance of half the circumference by the distance Alfie flies per day.

Half the circumference of the earth is 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.

"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, we know the average car's speed is 120 Miles per hour. 

Since the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, we can calculate its speed as follows:
2nd fastest car's speed = 5 * average car's speed
2nd fastest car's speed = 5 * 120
2nd fastest car's speed = 600 Miles per hour

Now, we know the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we can calculate the speed of the faster car as follows:
Faster car's speed = 1.25 * 2nd fastest car's speed
Faster car's speed = 1.25 * 600
Faster car's speed = 750 Miles per hour

The faster car goes 750 Miles per hour."
"To find Vince's current age, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as 'x'. Since Liam's age two years ago was twice Vince's age, we can write the equation: 2x = Liam's age two years ago.

We know that Liam is 16 years old now, so two years ago, he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. 

Now, we can set up the equation: 2x = 14. To find 'x', we divide both sides by 2: x = 14 / 2 = 7.

Since 'x' represents Vince's age two years ago, we need to add 2 to find Vince's current age: 7 + 2 = 9.

Therefore, Vince is 9 years old now.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A, the number of eggs Madeline painted as M, the number of eggs Camden painted as C, and the number of eggs Sarah painted as S.

We know the following:
1. A = M (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)
2. C + S = 30 (Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)
3. C = S + 12 (Camden painted 12 more than Sarah)

We can substitute the value of C from equation 3 into equation 2:
S + (S + 12) = 30
Combine like terms:
2S + 12 = 30
Subtract 12 from both sides:
2S = 18
Divide both sides by 2:
S = 9

Now that we know S, we can find C:
C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Since A = M, we know that A = 9 as well.

Now, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
C - A = 21 - 9
C - A = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total weight of the crayons, we need to calculate the number of boxes needed and the total weight of the crayons. 

Since Nik has 200 crayons and each box can hold 8 crayons, the number of boxes needed is 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is also 200 ounces.

To convert the total weight from ounces to pounds, we divide by 16 (since there are 16 ounces in a pound). 

Total weight in pounds = (200 ounces + 200 ounces) / 16 = 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds (crayons) + 25 pounds (boxes) = 50 pounds.

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how much John makes, we need to break down the process step by step.

1. John cuts down an 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of it, he can make 80% of 80 feet, which is 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet of logs.

2. He cuts the logs into 4-foot logs. Since he has 64 feet of logs, he can make 64 / 4 = 16 logs.

3. From each log, he cuts 5 planks. Since he has 16 logs, he can make 16 * 5 = 80 planks.

4. He sells each plank for $1.2. Since he has 80 planks, he can make 80 * $1.2 = $96.

Therefore, John makes $96."
"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to first find the salaries of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of her brother's salary. So, her brother's salary is 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is 2 * ($5000 + $10,000) = 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

Now, we add up their salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The total amount of money they all have together is $40,000.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the time spent on the sidewalk. 

Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, let's denote her speed on the beach as x miles per minute. Then, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes. So, we can set up the equation 2x * 40 = 2 miles to find her speed on the beach. 

Solving for x, we get x = 1 mile per minute.

Now that we know her speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk, which is 2x = 2 miles per minute.

We know that she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk. So, the time spent on the sidewalk is 1 mile / 2 miles per minute = 0.5 minutes.

The total time spent on the entire 3-mile walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, which is 40 minutes + 0.5 minutes = 40.5 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we need to first calculate how much she has saved so far. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved is 4 * 8 = $32.

Since she wants to save a total of $60, we need to subtract the amount she has already saved from the target amount: 60 - 32 = $28.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take to save the remaining amount. Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the remaining amount by the weekly savings: 28 / 4 = 7 weeks.

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

Two trees each had 4 blue birds, so the total number of blue birds in these trees is 2 x 4 = 8.

One tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, we add the total number of blue birds from each group: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many marbles Bob originally had. 

We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 * 12 = 24. 

So, if he receives 24 marbles, he will have 60 marbles. To find out how many marbles he originally had, we subtract 24 from 60. 

60 - 24 = 36

Now, we know that Bob originally had 36 marbles. 

If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, we subtract 10 from 36. 

36 - 10 = 26

Therefore, Bob will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Donny has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees, and the other is unknown. Let's call the temperature of the unknown mug 'x' degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle, the amount of water in the bottle is 4 ounces. This means the remaining water in the 33-degree mug is 28 ounces (since 8 ounces were poured out).

Now, Donny pours 1 ounce from the unknown mug into the bottle. The total amount of water in the bottle is now 5 ounces.

Since Donny can drink the water in the bottle, the temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees. We know that the water in the bottle is 5 ounces, and 4 ounces came from the 33-degree mug. Therefore, the remaining 1 ounce must have come from the unknown mug.

Let's set up an equation to represent the situation:

(4 ounces from the 33-degree mug) + (1 ounce from the unknown mug) = 5 ounces in the bottle

Since the water in the bottle is at least 40 degrees, we can set up an inequality to represent the situation:

(4 ounces from the 33-degree mug) + (1 ounce from the unknown mug) ≥ 40

Substituting the values, we get:

4 + x ≥ 40

Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get:

x ≥ 36

So, the temperature of the unknown mug must be at least 36 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added by each company and add them to the initial number of animals.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.

Melkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day for three weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 3 * 7 = 21 days. So, the total number of cows added is 20 * 21 = 420 cows.

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day for three weeks. So, the total number of chickens added is 10 * 21 = 210 chickens.

Now, we add the initial number of animals to the number of animals added:

Cows: 50 + 420 = 470 cows
Chickens: 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 470 + 230 = 700.

"To find the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs without the discount. 

Each pack costs $10.00, and there are 4 packs, so the total cost is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $40.00. 10% of $40.00 is 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.

The total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Now, we need to find the cost of each bagel. There are 9 bagels in each pack, and there are 4 packs. So, the total number of bagels is 9 * 4 = 36.

To find the cost of each bagel, we divide the total cost after the discount by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

The final answer is $1.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we need to find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

Let's start by finding out how many scoops 6 potatoes make. Since it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops, we can say that 6 potatoes make 3 scoops. 

Now, we know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, we need to find out how many scoops 23 scoops minus 5 scoops is equal to. 

23 scoops - 5 scoops = 18 scoops

Now, we know that 6 potatoes make 3 scoops. To find out how many potatoes make 18 scoops, we can divide 18 scoops by 3 scoops. 

18 scoops / 3 scoops = 6

So, Gomer ate 6 potatoes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in 30 days is 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in 30 days is 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

Now, we add the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days: 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can convert 240 eggs to dozens by dividing by 12: 240 / 12 = 20.

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to determine the total number of red jellybeans. Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

Now, we know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total to find the number of blue jellybeans. 

60 (total) - 17 (green) - 34 (red) = 9

Therefore, there are 9 blue jellybeans in the jar."
"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the number of lemons he gets in a year and then multiply it by 10.

Since Tim grows 5 trees and each tree yields 6 lemons per year, the total number of lemons he gets in a year is 5 * 6 = 30.

To find the total number of lemons in a decade, we multiply the annual amount by 10: 30 * 10 = 300.

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means that for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total number of parts in the ratio is 5 + 9 = 14. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can divide 84 by 14 to find the value of one part of the ratio. 

84 / 14 = 6

Now, we multiply the value of one part by the number of parts representing women in the ratio (9) to find the initial number of women on the bus.

9 * 6 = 54

Since 20 women alight from the bus, we subtract 20 from the initial number of women to find the number of women who have remained on the bus.

54 - 20 = 34

The number of women who have remained on the bus is 34."
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we first need to determine how many bouquets he sold. 

Since each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 per day from bouquets, we can divide $56 by $8 to find out how many bouquets he sold per day. 

$56 / $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since he sold 7 bouquets per day for 3 days, we multiply 7 by 3 to find the total number of bouquets sold.

7 * 3 = 21 bouquets

Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, so we multiply the total number of bouquets by 12 to find the total number of sunflowers sold.

21 * 12 = 252 sunflowers

The final answer is: 252"
"To determine the amount of money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys and the revenue he generates from selling 60% of his inventory.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks. Since Adam invests all his $100, he buys 100 / 5 = 20 rocks.

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling 60% of his inventory. 60% of 20 rocks is 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks. He sells each rock for $7, so the total revenue is 12 * 7 = $84.

The total cost of the rocks is 20 * 5 = $100. Since the revenue is $84, Adam loses 100 - 84 = $16.

The final answer is 16."
"To determine the number of days required for Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the time it takes to complete each type of picture scene and then find the maximum time among the three.

For large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
For medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
For small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

Since 9 days is the maximum time required, Lauren will need 9 days to complete the project.

"To find out how many eggs each child receives, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. 

First, we need to convert three dozen eggs into a numerical value. Since one dozen is equal to 12, three dozen eggs would be 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, we divide the total number of eggs (36) by the number of children (4). 

36 ÷ 4 = 9

So, each child receives 9 eggs."
"To determine the total amount Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to calculate the daily cost of food for all the fish and then multiply it by the number of days in May.

There are 31 days in May. Since each fish needs $1 worth of food per day, the total daily cost for all the fish is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days in May: $3 * 31 = $93.

Therefore, Jen spends $93 on food for her fish in May.

93"
"To find out how many roses Patricia has now, we need to subtract the number of roses she gave to her mother from the initial number of roses she had, and then add the number of roses she bought.

Initial number of roses = 30
Number of roses given to her mother = 24
Number of roses bought = 15

Number of roses left after giving some to her mother = 30 - 24 = 6
Total number of roses now = 6 + 15 = 21

Patricia now has 21 roses."
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Total distance traveled = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles
Total time taken = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
= 250 miles / 5 hours
= 50 miles per hour

The average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as 0.20 in decimal form.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is 3 * 0.20 = 0.60.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning: 0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

The final answer is 12%."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many seashells each person collected. 

Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as 'x'. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, Carlos collected 2x seashells. 

We know that Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so Jim collected 2x + 5 seashells.

We also know that the total number of seashells collected is the sum of the seashells collected by each person. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + (2x + 5) = Total number of seashells

Combine like terms:

5x + 5 = Total number of seashells

Since we don't know the total number of seashells, we need more information. However, we can express the total number of seashells in terms of 'x'. 

Let's assume the total number of seashells is 'T'. Then, we can write:

T = 5x + 5

Now, we know that they divided the seashells equally among themselves, so each person got T/3 seashells.

Since we don't know the total number of seashells, we can't find the exact number of seashells each person got. However, we can express it in terms of 'x':

Each person got (5x + 5)/3 seashells.

To find the value of 'x', we need more information. However, we can express the number of seashells each person got in terms of 'x'."
"To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays in a week. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday, and there are 2 weekend days in a week. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 * 2 = 10.

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week. 20 + 10 = 30.

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. 

Since the second song is 60% longer than the first song, we can calculate its length as follows:

Length of the second song = Length of the first song + (60% of the length of the first song)
= 5 minutes + (0.6 * 5 minutes)
= 5 minutes + 3 minutes
= 8 minutes

Now, we can find the total time of the cassette by adding the lengths of both songs:

Total time = Length of the first song + Length of the second song
= 5 minutes + 8 minutes
= 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes."
"To calculate the total profit, we need to first find the total cost of the devices and the total selling price.

The cost of 2 devices bought on Monday is 2 * $20 = $40.
The cost of 4 devices bought on Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80.
The total cost is $40 + $80 = $120.

The selling price of each device is twice the cost, so the selling price of each device is 2 * $20 = $40.
The total selling price of 6 devices is 6 * $40 = $240.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost, which is $240 - $120 = $120.

The final answer is 120."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine Carl's height first. We know that Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel. So, Ned's height is 7 - 2 = 5 feet. Since Carl is one foot taller than Ned, Carl's height is 5 + 1 = 6 feet.

Now, we know that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, Carl's cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet long.

"To determine the number of bottles needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total energy demand of 2300 people.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the total energy demand as follows:

2300 people * 100% = 2300
2300 * 20% = 460 bottles per person * 100% = 46000 bottles

Now, we need to find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total energy demand of 2300 people. 

Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many days it will take to meet the demand, we divide the total energy demand by the daily production capacity:

46000 bottles / 4200 bottles per day = 11 days

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we can calculate the total number of bottles needed to meet the demand:

46000 bottles / 11 days = 4181.8 bottles per day

Now, we subtract the daily production capacity from the total number of bottles needed per day to find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce:

4181.8 bottles per day - 4200 bottles per day = -18.2 bottles per day

Since we cannot produce a negative number of bottles, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of additional bottles needed, so we will round up to the nearest whole number.

To find the total number of additional bottles needed, we multiply the daily shortage by the number of days:

-18.2 bottles per day * 11 days = -200.2 bottles

Since we cannot produce a negative number of bottles, we will round up to the nearest whole number.

The total number of additional bottles needed is 201.

The final answer is: 201"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the total number of babies wearing purple. Since Carla dresses 3/4 of the octuplets in purple, and there are 8 babies in total, the number of babies wearing purple is 3/4 * 8 = 6.

Now, we know that 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows. So, the number of babies wearing both purple and bows is 1/3 * 6 = 2.

We also know that all the blue-wearers wear bows. Since there are 1/4 of the babies wearing blue, the number of babies wearing blue is 1/4 * 8 = 2.

Now, we can find the total number of babies wearing bows. This is the sum of the babies wearing both purple and bows, and the babies wearing blue, which is 2 + 2 = 4.

To find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we divide the number of babies wearing both purple and bows by the total number of babies wearing bows, and then multiply by 100. 

So, the percentage chance is (2/4) * 100 = 50%.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on all days.

Total reports received = 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

First, let's find the total number of reports received on Wednesday and Saturday (since we don't have information about Saturday). We can do this by subtracting the reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total reports received.

Reports received on Wednesday and Saturday = Total reports received - Reports received on Monday and Tuesday
= 5168 - 1907
= 3261

Now, we can find the number of reports received on Wednesday by subtracting the reports received on Thursday and Friday from the total reports received on Wednesday and Saturday.

Reports received on Wednesday = Reports received on Wednesday and Saturday - Reports received on Thursday and Friday
= 3261 - 2136

"To find out how much money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from each sale.

First, he sold half of his 80 square meters of land for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters. 

So, he sold 40 square meters for $50. 

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. 1/4 of 80 square meters is 20 square meters. 

So, he sold 20 square meters for $30.

Now, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left.

He sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter. So, he sold 20 square meters for 20 * $3 = $60.

Now, let's add up the money he received from each sale: $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs found by each person and subtract that from the initial number of eggs.

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.
Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.
Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by each person: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To find the total number of apartments, we first need to calculate the combined number of apartments in the first two complexes. 

200 apartments * 2 = 400 apartments

The last complex is 60% bigger than the combined number of apartments in the first two complexes. 

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240 apartments.

So, the last complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we can calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from. 

400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments

Since John collects garbage 3 times a week, the total number of collections per week is 1440 * 3 = 4320.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 4320 * 0.40 = $1728.

Year 4: 7 * 150 = 1050 fruits
Year 5: 7 * 350 = 2450 fruits
Year 6: 7 * 1050 = 7350 fruits
Year 7: 7 * 2450 = 17150 fruits

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R. 

We are given the following information:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: R = 4B
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: B = Y - 7
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: R + B + Y = 37

We can substitute the expressions for R and B from the first two equations into the third equation:
4B + B + Y = 37
Combine like terms:
5B + Y = 37

Now, we can substitute B = Y - 7 into the equation:
5(Y - 7) + Y = 37
Expand the equation:
5Y - 35 + Y = 37
Combine like terms:
6Y - 35 = 37
Add 35 to both sides:
6Y = 72
Divide both sides by 6:
Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
B = Y - 7
B = 12 - 7
B = 5

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope:
R = 4B
R = 4 * 5
R = 20

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much money Rissa and Ronnie initially had. 

Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so if Ronnie had $5, Rissa had 3 * 5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to their sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. Let's denote the amount she gave to her sister as x. 

So, 15 - x = (4/5) * 15
15 - x = 12
x = 3

This means Rissa gave her sister $3. Now, we know that Rissa had $15 and gave $3 to her sister, so she is left with 15 - 3 = $12.

Since Rissa gave an equal amount of money to her sister, Ronnie also gave $3 to her sister. 

Ronnie initially had $5 and gave $3 to her sister, so she is left with 5 - 3 = $2.

Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, let's denote the amount of each color as 'x'. The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half the mural is yellow. This means the other half is divided into red, white, and purple, which is 3 parts. 

Since the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half of it is yellow, the other half is 12 / 2 = 6 pints. This 6 pints is divided into 3 parts (red, white, and purple), so each part is 6 / 3 = 2 pints.

Since 'x' represents the amount of each color, we know that x = 2. 

The amount of red paint used is 'x', which is 2 pints.

"To find out how many cycles you can run with the new box, we first need to determine the number of pods in the new box. Since the new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, we can calculate the number of pods in the new box as follows:

Number of pods in the new box = 100 + (100 * 0.20)
Number of pods in the new box = 100 + 20
Number of pods in the new box = 120

Now, we can calculate the number of cycles you can run with the new box for $1:

Number of cycles = Number of pods in the new box / Cost per pod
Cost per pod = $12 / 100 = $0.12
Number of cycles = 120 / $0.12
Number of cycles = 1000

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Thomas initially withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the number of bills he has is $1000 / $20 = 50 bills.

He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he is left with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

Thomas then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 bills is 40 / 2 = 20 bills. So, he is left with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

After that, he triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling his money means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 * $5 = 300 5 dollar bills.

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by both teams in both halves. Team A scored 4 + 2 = 6 goals in total. Team B scored 2 + 8 = 10 goals in total.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 + 10 = 16 goals.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be expressed as:

W = 5(C + 7)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

W = 5C + 35

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be expressed as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Substituting the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

C = 20

So, Colin's current age is 20.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to first determine the total number of books he can buy with $27,000. 

Since Bob can buy 100 books for $500, we can find the cost per book by dividing $500 by 100 books. 

Cost per book = $500 / 100 books = $5 per book

Now, we can find the total number of books Bob can buy with $27,000 by dividing $27,000 by the cost per book.

Total number of books = $27,000 / $5 per book = 5,400 books

Since Bob is distributing the books between 3 schools, we can divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books he can buy per school.

Number of books per school = 5,400 books / 3 schools = 1,800 books per school

"To find the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to divide the total weight of coal (850 kg) by the weight of each bag (50 kg) to determine the number of bags, then multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag.

Number of bags = Total weight of coal / Weight per bag
Number of bags = 850 kg / 50 kg
Number of bags = 17

Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 17 * $18
Total cost = $306

The total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To determine the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza is consumed.

For the cheese pizza, 6 friends eat 6 slices each, so the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed is 6 friends * 6 slices = 36 slices.

For the pepperoni pizza, 6 friends eat 4 slices each, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed is 6 friends * 4 slices = 24 slices.

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 12 and 8 to determine the total number of slices needed.

The LCM of 12 and 8 is 24. 

To find the number of pizzas needed, we divide the total number of slices consumed by the number of slices per pizza. 

For cheese pizza: 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas
For pepperoni pizza: 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas

Since both types of pizzas require 3 pizzas, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas. 

The total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy is 3 + 3 = 6 pizzas.

"To find the total miles Sam ran this week, we need to calculate the miles he ran on each day.

On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. So, the total miles he ran on these days is 3 * 3 = 9 miles.

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. So, the total miles he ran on these days is 5 * 2 = 10 miles.

Now, we add the miles he ran on both sets of days: 9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles.

Therefore, Sam ran a total of 19 miles this week.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net rate at which Jay builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in 1 hour, so his rate of building snowballs is 20 snowballs per hour. 

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. To find the rate at which they melt, we need to convert 15 minutes to hours. 15 minutes is 0.25 hours. 

So, 2 snowballs melt every 0.25 hours. 

Now, we can calculate the rate at which snowballs melt per hour: 2 snowballs / 0.25 hours = 8 snowballs per hour.

The net rate at which Jay builds snowballs is 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs per hour.

To find the time it takes for Jay to have 60 snowballs, we can divide 60 by the net rate of 12 snowballs per hour: 60 / 12 = 5 hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

We know that John is 28 now and that he was twice as old as Jim when Digimon was released. 

Let's denote Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release as 'x'. Since John was twice as old as Jim, John's age at the time of Digimon's release would be 2x.

We also know that Digimon was released 20 years ago. So, John's current age (28) minus 20 years will give us John's age at the time of Digimon's release. 

28 - 20 = 8

Since John's age at the time of Digimon's release was 8, we can set up the equation 2x = 8. 

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 4. 

This means Jim was 4 years old when Digimon was released. 

Since Digimon was released 20 years ago, Jim's current age would be 4 + 20 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many slices each person ate and then add them together.

Doxa ate 1 slice.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, let's add the slices eaten by each person: 
1 (Doxa) + 2 (her sister) + 3 (her brother) = 6 slices.

Therefore, they all ate a total of 6 slices of apple.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the total number of bandages at the end of the first day is x - 38 + 50 = x + 12.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the second day is (x + 12) - 28 = x - 16.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages, so they had x - 16 + 100 = x + 84 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the third day is (x + 84) - 25 = x + 59.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation x + 59 = 78.

Solving for x, we get x = 78 - 59 = 19.

Therefore, the nurses started with 19 bandages on the first day.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut and the cost of the color separately. 

First, we calculate the cost of the haircut. Since her hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, the length of her hair decreased by 2 inches. 

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, so the total cost of the haircut is 2 inches * $30 per inch = $60.

The cost of the color is $40.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the haircut and the cost of the color, which is $60 + $40 = $100.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her total hours worked and her total earnings from hourly rate and attendance.

Total hours worked in April = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks = 7.5 * 6 * 4 = 180 hours

Total earnings from hourly rate = 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since Jen has complete attendance for the entire month, she will receive an additional $10 for each week. 
Total attendance bonus = $10/week * 4 weeks = $40

Total earnings for April = Total earnings from hourly rate + Total attendance bonus
Total earnings for April = $270 + $40
Total earnings for April = $310

For taking the trash out: 2 times * $0.75 = $1.50
For cleaning the room: 1 time * $1.50 = $1.50

Now, let's add the earnings together: $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $8.00

Jason earned $8.00 in a two-week period."
"To find the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we first need to determine the amount of blood in one shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons, we can calculate the amount of blood in one shark as follows:

40 gallons (whale's blood) * 3 = 120 gallons (shark's blood)

Now, we can multiply the amount of blood in one shark by the number of sharks to find the total amount of blood in ten sharks:

120 gallons/shark * 10 sharks = 1200 gallons

The total amount of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is 1200 gallons."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people who entered the restaurant at each time and then add them together.

First, 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning. 

At 10:00, 40 more people entered, making the total 50 + 40 = 90 people.

Then, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. So, the total becomes 90 + 80 = 170 people.

By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 40 people came in first, 3 * 40 = 120 people came in by evening. Adding these to the total, we get 170 + 120 = 290 people.

Therefore, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 290.

"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and black pens separately and then add them together.

Alain bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack has 5 pens. So, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 pens.

Since Alain bought twice the amount of black pens than the red, the number of black pens is 2 * 25 = 50 pens.

The total number of pens Alain has is the sum of red and black pens: 25 + 50 = 75 pens.

"To find the total cost, we first need to determine the number of bottles of cognac John buys. Since he buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, and he buys 10 bottles of scotch, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of each bottle of scotch is $600 / 10 = $60. Since the cognac costs 50% more per bottle, the cost of each bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $90.

The total cost of the scotch is 10 * $60 = $600. The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to calculate the number of trees planted on each day and then add them together.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's add the total number of trees planted on both days: 
- White Oak trees: 20 (first day) + 30 (second day) = 50
- Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90

Total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days: 50 (White Oak) + 90 (Lodgepole Pine) = 140

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed, so 24 - 4 = 20 gallons remained.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, so 20 - 7 = 13 gallons remained.

On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed, so 13 - 5 = 8 gallons remained.

On the fourth day, 3 people drank the remaining root beer, so 8 - 3 = 5 gallons remained.

To find out how much each person got, we divide the remaining root beer by the number of people: 5 / 3 = 1.67 gallons per person.

"To solve this problem, we need to translate the given statement into an equation. Let's denote the number of coffee mugs as 'x'. The statement ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8. According to the problem, this expression equals 40. 

So, we can set up the equation: 4x + 8 = 40.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 4x = 40 - 8, which simplifies to 4x = 32.

Next, divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for x: x = 32 / 4, which simplifies to x = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we first need to find the total number of fish with red stripes. 

One-third of the fish have red stripes, so we calculate 1/3 of 66: 
1/3 * 66 = 22

Now, we need to find the number of fish that do not have red stripes. Since 22 fish have red stripes, we subtract this from the total number of fish:
66 - 22 = 44

Now, 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. We calculate 5/11 of 44:
5/11 * 44 = 20

Therefore, the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is 22 (red) + 20 (blue) = 42.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had and then subtract the colors she used or lost.

Amy had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 colors.

In total, Amy initially had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister steals one palette, which has 4 colors, so Amy loses 4 colors. 

Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which has 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she uses up 3 colors.

Now, let's subtract the colors she lost and used: 26 - 4 - 3 = 19.

"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to calculate the height of the first floor and then subtract the height of the second floor from it.

The height of the house is 7 times Mattison's height, which is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison's height, which is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Since the height of the first floor is 180 inches, the height of the second floor would be the remaining portion of the house's height, which is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor would be the height of the first floor minus the height of the second floor, which is 180 - 240 = -60 inches. However, this is not possible as the height cannot be negative. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. The height of the first floor is 180 inches, and the height of the second floor is 240 inches. The height of the roof from the second floor's floor would be the height of the first floor minus the height of the second floor, but this is not the correct approach. 

The correct approach is to find the height of the roof from the ground level. The height of the house is 420 inches, and the height of the first floor is 180 inches. The height of the second floor is 240 inches. 

The height of the roof from the ground level would be the height of the house minus the height of the first floor, which is 420 - 180 = 240 inches. 

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor would be the height of the roof from the ground level minus the height of the second floor, which is 240 - 240 = 0 inches.

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we need to first calculate the total miles walked by the first three dogs. 

The first dog walks 1 mile, the second dog walks 4 miles, and the third dog walks 3 miles. 

Total miles walked by the first three dogs = 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

Since there are 4 dogs in total, and the average miles walked per day is 3 miles, we can calculate the total miles walked by all four dogs as follows:

Total miles walked by all four dogs = Average miles per dog * Number of dogs
Total miles walked by all four dogs = 3 * 4
Total miles walked by all four dogs = 12 miles

Now, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all four dogs to find out how many miles the last dog needs:

Miles needed by the last dog = Total miles walked by all four dogs - Total miles walked by the first three dogs
Miles needed by the last dog = 12 - 8

"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute, so the total cost is 16 * $0.25 = $4.

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.2 per minute, so the total cost is 20 * $0.2 = $4.

The total cost of the 36-minute call is the sum of these two costs: $4 + $4 = $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To find the total inches of rain on Tuesday, we need to first calculate twice the amount of rain on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 inches. 

Then, we add 1 more inch to this amount, so the total inches of rain on Tuesday will be 4 + 1 = 5 inches.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of treats Carly made. Since each person gets two treats and there are five people in the class, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

We know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Let's represent the number of cupcakes as 'c'. Then, the number of brownies can be represented as 3c - 2.

Since the total number of treats is 10, we can set up the equation: c + (3c - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4c - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides: 4c = 12

Divide both sides by 4: c = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To calculate the total cost, we first need to find the discounted price for the manicure and pedicure. 

The basic manicure costs $35, and the basic pedicure costs $40. The total cost for both is $35 + $40 = $75. 

Since Karen gets a 20% discount for getting both, we need to calculate 20% of $75. 

20% of $75 = 0.20 * $75 = $15. 

The discounted price for both manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60. 

Now, let's calculate the cost of nail art. Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers (5 on each hand). The cost of nail art per nail is $3. 

The total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30. 

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of nail art. 

Total cost = $60 + $30 = $90."
"To find the total number of magazines Susan receives per year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them together.

The 3 magazines that send 12 issues each will send a total of 3 * 12 = 36 issues per year.

The 1 magazine that sends 6 issues per year will send 1 * 6 = 6 issues per year.

The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so it sends 4 * 6 = 24 issues per year.

Now, let's add the total number of issues from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

Therefore, Susan receives 66 magazines per year.

66"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of paintings each person has. 

Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as K. Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, Shelley's paintings can be represented as K + 8.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, so Samantha's paintings can be represented as (K + 8) - 12.

We are given that Samantha has 27 paintings. Therefore, we can set up the equation (K + 8) - 12 = 27.

Simplifying the equation, we get K + 8 - 12 = 27, which further simplifies to K - 4 = 27.

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation, we get K = 31.

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

31"
"To find the price of the toy after the discounts, we need to calculate the price after each discount.

Initial price in November: $40

Price in December after an 80% increase: 
$40 + (80% of $40) 
= $40 + (0.8 * $40) 
= $40 + $32 
= $72

Price in January after a 50% decrease from the December price: 
$72 - (50% of $72) 
= $72 - (0.5 * $72) 
= $72 - $36 
= $36

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"To calculate the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the earnings from the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons separately.

For the standard rate lessons, Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 per hour. So, his earnings from these lessons will be:
4 * $80 = $320

For the reduced rate lessons, Charlie has 2 lessons at a 25% discount. The reduced rate is 75% of the standard rate, which is $80 * 0.75 = $60 per hour. So, his earnings from these lessons will be:
2 * $60 = $120

Now, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to get the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:
$320 + $120 = $440

The total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."
"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of scores.

First, let's add up the scores: 
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

There are 9 scores in total. 

Now, let's divide the sum by the total number of scores: 
630 / 9 = 70

The mean score is 70."
"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to first determine how many pomelos she had after giving some away. Since she is left with 1/4 of the original amount, we can set up the following equation:

Original amount - Pomelos given away = 1/4 of the original amount

Let's denote the original amount as x. Then, the equation becomes:

x - Pomelos given away = x/4

We know that Eve had 20 pieces of pomelos originally. So, we can substitute x with 20:

20 - Pomelos given away = 20/4

To find the number of pomelos given away, we can simplify the equation:

20 - Pomelos given away = 5

Now, we can solve for Pomelos given away:

Pomelos given away = 20 - 5
Pomelos given away = 15

The final answer is 15."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the number of apples Walter ate: 
   2/5 of 60 apples = (2/5) * 60 = 24 apples

2. Calculate the remaining number of apples after Walter ate 24 apples:
   60 - 24 = 36 apples

3. Calculate the number of apples Walter gave to his sister:
   25% of 36 apples = (25/100) * 36 = 9 apples

4. Calculate the remaining number of apples after Walter gave 9 apples to his sister:
   36 - 9 = 27 apples

5. Calculate the amount of money Walter received from selling the remaining apples:
   27 apples * $3/apple = $81

The final answer is 81."
"To find the total number of novels Regina has written this year, we need to multiply the number of novels she wrote last year by 4, since 3 quarters of the novels she wrote this year is equal to the number of novels she wrote last year.

Number of novels written last year = 9
Number of quarters in a year = 4

Total number of novels written this year = 9 * 4
Total number of novels written this year = 36

"To find the total distance covered by Michael, we need to calculate the total time he spent traveling. 

First, we need to convert the speed from km/hr to km/day. There are 24 hours in a day, so:

50 km/hr * 24 hours = 1200 km/day

Now, we can calculate the total distance covered in 3 days:

1200 km/day * 3 days = 3600 km

To find the percentage of the total distance covered, we can divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100:

(3600 km / 6000 km) * 100 = 60%

Therefore, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

Final answer: 60%"
"To find the initial number of grapes, we need to work backwards from the information given.

Madeline ate 6 grapes, and her brother used 5 times as many grapes as she did, which is 5 * 6 = 30 grapes. 

So, the total grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, with each pie requiring 12 grapes. The total grapes used for the pies is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

Since the total grapes used by the family is 36 (by Madeline and her brother) + 48 (for the pies) = 84 grapes.

Therefore, the initial number of grapes is 84.

"To calculate the total cost of making macaroni and cheese, we need to first calculate the weekly cost. 

The pasta costs $1.00 per box, and Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week. So, the weekly cost of pasta is $1.00.

The cost of cheddar cheese is $3.00, and the cost of gruyere cheese is twice that amount, which is $6.00. The total cost of cheese is $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00.

The total weekly cost of making macaroni and cheese is $1.00 (pasta) + $9.00 (cheese) = $10.00.

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, the total yearly cost is $10.00 * 52 weeks = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520."
"To find the total time spent cleaning classrooms, we need to multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom. 

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours by dividing by 60.

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we can divide the total time spent cleaning by the total hours worked and multiply by 100.

Percentage of day spent cleaning = (20 hours / 8 hours) * 100 = 250%

The custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning classrooms."
"To determine the number of bookcases needed, we need to calculate the total number of books each shelf can hold and then divide the total number of books by the total capacity of the shelves.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, and since each middle shelf can hold 10 books, the bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of the middle shelves: 2 middle shelves * 10 books/shelf = 20 books.

The total capacity of all shelves is 20 (bottom) + 20 (middle) + 15 (top) = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, she needs at least 2 bookcases to hold all of them, as 110 books / 55 books/bookcase = 2 bookcases.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find Rose's profit, we first need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs:
5 dozens of eggs = 5 * 12 = 60 eggs
Cost per dozen = $2.40
Total cost = 60 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 5 dozens
Total cost = 5 * $2.40 = $12

Next, let's calculate the total revenue:
Rose sells 3 eggs for $1
Number of eggs in 5 dozens = 60 eggs
Number of sets of 3 eggs = 60 eggs / 3 eggs per set = 20 sets
Total revenue = 20 sets * $1 per set = $20

Now, let's calculate the profit:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $20 - $12
Profit = $8

"To find the number of white hats, we first need to determine the total number of hats that are not red. Since half of the hats are red, the number of red hats is 1/2 * 100 = 50.

The remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50.

Now, 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue. So, the number of blue hats is 3/5 * 50 = 30.

The rest of the hats are white. To find the number of white hats, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats: 50 - 30 = 20.

Therefore, Skyler has 20 white hats.

"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first calculate the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's on sale for $3.00 off. 

$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can divide the discounted price by the number of sticks to find the cost per stick.

$15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50 per stick

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100.

$0.50 × 100 = 50 cents

The final answer is 50."
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly in both tests to achieve a 70% passing score.

The total number of questions in both tests is 70 + 40 = 110 questions.

Since Audrey needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, we can calculate the required number of correct answers as follows:

70% of 110 questions = 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions

Now, we know that Audrey got 60% of the first test correct, which is 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

To find out how many questions she needs to get right on the second test, we subtract the number of correct answers from the first test from the total required number of correct answers:

77 (required correct answers) - 42 (correct answers from the first test) = 35

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as 's' and the number of blueberry cubes as 'b'. We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can write the equation:

s + b = 116

We also know that the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so we can write another equation:

b = 5s - 4

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first one:

s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6s - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6s = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

s = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting s into the second equation:

b = 5(20) - 4
b = 100 - 4
b = 96

The total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is 3360."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Brendan started with 10 marbles.
2. He dropped half of them, which is 10 / 2 = 5 marbles.
3. He found 3 more marbles, so now he has 10 - 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.
4. He then found 1 marble that wasn't a marble, but a bead, so he got rid of it. This doesn't change the number of marbles he has, as he's just removing an item that wasn't a marble.

Brendan ended up with 8 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know that for every 2 customers who come into the dealership, 1 will buy a car. This means that for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold. Since Jason needs to sell 15 cars, he needs to have at least 15 customers. 

To find the minimum number of customers needed, we can divide the number of cars by 1 (since 1 car is sold per 2 customers), which gives us 15 customers.

Now, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes into the dealership. To find the minimum number of calls needed to get 15 customers, we can divide the number of customers by 1 (since 1 customer comes from 25 calls), which gives us 15 calls. However, this is not the correct answer because it assumes that all 15 customers come from the first 15 calls. 

Since we know that for every 25 calls, 1 customer comes in, we can multiply 15 customers by 25 to get the total number of calls needed to get 15 customers. This gives us 15 * 25 = 375 calls.

Therefore, Jason needs to make at least 375 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of each type of light source available and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. There are 4 people and 2 flashlights per room, and there are 8 rooms. So, the total number of flashlights is 4 people * 2 flashlights/person = 8 flashlights.

Next, let's calculate the number of candles. There are 4 rooms with small candles and 4 rooms with medium candles. Since there are 4 small candles per room, the total number of small candles is 4 rooms * 4 candles/room = 16 candles. Similarly, the total number of medium candles is 4 rooms * 5 candles/room = 20 candles.

Now, we can add the total number of flashlights and candles together to get the overall number of light sources. Total light sources = 8 flashlights + 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 44.

The final answer is: 44"
"To find out how many chips each person gets, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of family members. 

First, we need to find the total number of chips. Since Mitchell bought two bags of chips with 55 chips each, the total number of chips is 2 * 55 = 110.

Now, we divide the total number of chips by the number of family members: 110 / 5 = 22.

So, each person gets 22 chips.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes to complete each side of the Rubik's cube and then add them up.

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so each takes 5 * 2 = 10 minutes.
- The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so each takes 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time for all six sides:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

Therefore, it takes 30 minutes to complete the Rubik's cube.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of helmets and then the number of robots. 

Since there are half as many robots as helmets, and there are 20 helmets, the number of robots is 20 / 2 = 10.

Since there are half as many helmets as footballs, and there are 20 helmets, the number of footballs is 20 * 2 = 40.

Now, we can find the total number of items by adding the number of helmets, robots, and footballs: 20 + 10 + 40 = 70.

The total number of items Dominick saw is 70."
"To find the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, we need to first calculate the total number of minutes he spends on calls per day. 

Since he spends 6 hours per day on calls, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the hours to minutes by multiplying 6 hours by 60 minutes per hour, which equals 360 minutes per day.

Now, we can divide the total minutes per day by the time it takes to deal with a single call (15 minutes) to find the number of calls per day. 

360 minutes per day / 15 minutes per call = 24 calls per day.

Since Tim works 5 days a week, we can multiply the number of calls per day by 5 to find the total number of calls per week.

24 calls per day * 5 days per week = 120 calls per week.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the difference in drying time, we need to calculate the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings and subtract the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

The old varnish takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting, so it would take 7 * 6 = 42 minutes to dry on 6 paintings.

The new varnish takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting, so it would take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes to dry on 6 paintings.

The difference in drying time is 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry than it would with the old varnish.

"To determine the total amount of water Crista needs, we need to calculate the amount of water for each group of plants and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount of water for the 4 plants that need half a cup of water: 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups.

Next, let's calculate the amount of water for the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water: 8 * 1 = 8 cups.

Now, we need to find out how many plants need a quarter of a cup of water. We know Crista has 20 plants in total, and we've already accounted for 4 + 8 = 12 plants. So, the number of plants that need a quarter of a cup of water is 20 - 12 = 8.

Now, let's calculate the amount of water for these 8 plants: 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.

Finally, we add up the water needed for all the plants: 2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups.

Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it takes Phineas to hop on land and the time it takes him to swim in the water.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance is 200 yards. Therefore, the distance on land is 100 yards and the distance in water is also 100 yards.

Time = Distance / Speed

For the land part: Time = 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes

For the water part: Time = 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes

Since these two parts are independent of each other, we add the times together to get the total time: 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

Therefore, it will take Phineas 15 minutes to return home.

"To find the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to calculate the cost of the main phone and the cost of the four additional phones.

The main phone costs $20.

Since each additional phone costs twice as much as the main phone, the cost of each additional phone is 2 * $20 = $40.

There are four additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is 4 * $40 = $160.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones, which is $20 + $160 = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in a month. Since there are approximately 30 days in June, Derrick sells 10 dozen doughnuts per day. 

First, we need to convert the number of doughnuts per day to individual doughnuts: 
10 dozen = 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.

Now, we multiply the number of doughnuts per day by the number of days in June:
120 doughnuts per day * 30 days = 3600 doughnuts.

Since each doughnut is sold for $2, we multiply the total number of doughnuts by the price per doughnut:
3600 doughnuts * $2 per doughnut = $7200.

Therefore, Derrick makes $7200 in June if he sells all the doughnuts."

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate John's new speaking speed after training and then determine how long it would take him to speak 10 pages.

First, we need to find John's new speaking speed. Since his speed is 2.5 times faster than his original speed, we multiply his original speed by 2.5.

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Now, we need to find out how many words John can speak in one minute. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we divide 60 by his new speed.

Words per minute = 60 seconds / 375 WPM = 0.16 words per second

Since each page has 450 words, we can calculate the total number of words in 10 pages:

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words per page = 4500 words

Now, we can calculate the time it would take John to speak 10 pages:

Time = Total words / Words per minute
Time = 4500 words / 0.16 words per second
Time = 281.25 seconds

To convert the time to minutes, we divide by 60:

Time (minutes) = 281.25 seconds / 60
Time (minutes) = 4.69 minutes

Therefore, it would take John approximately 4.69 minutes to speak 10 pages.

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the number of people on each day.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the number of people is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the total number of people was twice the number on the second day, so the number of people is 2 * 70 = 140.

Now, we know the number of people for the first three days. To find the total number of people for the rest of the week, we need to multiply the average number of people (60) by the number of days remaining (5).

The total number of people for the rest of the week is 60 * 5 = 300.

Now, we add the number of people for the first three days to the number of people for the rest of the week to find the total number of people Conor saw that week.

Total number of people = 50 + 70 + 140 + 300 = 460.

In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increased to four times the initial rate, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped. 

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate decreased to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 80 / 2 = 40 kernels popped.

Now, let's calculate the total number of kernels that popped during the entire process: 
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels.

A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped after Garrett took the pan off the heat. This is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

The total number of kernels that popped is 200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

Garrett has 210 pieces of popcorn to eat."
"To determine the total number of lemons needed, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for 4 gallons of lemonade. Since 1 gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice and 6 lemons yield 1 cup, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 4 gallons as follows:

4 gallons * 1 cup/gallon = 4 cups
4 cups / 1 cup/6 lemons = 4/6 * 6 = 4 lemons per gallon

Since Tim wants to make 5 gallons of lemonade (4 gallons for the party and 1 extra gallon), we multiply the number of lemons needed per gallon by 5:

4 lemons/gallon * 5 gallons = 20 lemons

For the extra gallon that is twice as tart, we need twice the amount of lemon juice, which is 2 cups. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for the extra gallon as follows:

2 cups / 1 cup/6 lemons = 2/6 * 6 = 2 lemons

Now, we add the number of lemons needed for the 4 gallons and the extra gallon:

20 lemons + 2 lemons = 22 lemons

The final answer is: 22"
"To determine the total amount of dog food needed for the week, we need to calculate the daily consumption of both breeds and then multiply it by 7.

The total daily consumption is as follows:
- 3 German Shepherds * 5 kg = 15 kg
- 2 Bulldogs * 3 kg = 6 kg
- Total daily consumption = 15 kg + 6 kg = 21 kg

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the total daily consumption by 7:
21 kg * 7 = 147 kg

The Kennel house will need 147 kg of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs, we need to calculate the total number of legs of all the animals and then divide by 2.

The 2-legged animals have 2 legs each, so 10 * 2 = 20 legs.
The 4-legged animals have 4 legs each, so 15 * 4 = 60 legs.

Total number of legs = 20 + 60 = 80 legs.

Since each leg belongs to one animal, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the total number of pairs of legs.
Total number of pairs of legs = 80 / 2 = 40.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the number of red blocks, we need to first determine the total number of blue and yellow blocks. 

Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, and there are 4 blue blocks, the number of yellow blocks is 2 * 4 = 8.

The total number of blue and yellow blocks is 4 + 8 = 12.

Since the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, the number of red blocks can be found by subtracting the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks: 32 - 12 = 20.

Therefore, there are 20 red blocks.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Elvis traveled. 

Since Elvis traveled west for 5 hours at 18mph, the distance he covered is 5 * 18 = 90 miles.

Then, he turned around and traveled east for 8 hours at the same speed of 18mph. The distance he covered in this part of the journey is 8 * 18 = 144 miles.

Since he traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the net distance from his starting point. 

The net distance is the difference between the two distances, which is 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

So, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house now.

"To calculate the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial value = $9000
Depreciation = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after Year 1 = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Year 2: 
Initial value = $6300
Depreciation = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after Year 2 = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Year 3: 
Initial value = $4410
Depreciation = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after Year 3 = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The boat is worth $3528 after three years."
"To find the number of pink candies, we need to first determine the number of orange and yellow candies. 

We know there are 54 red candies. The bag has twice as many orange candies as red candies, so there are 2 * 54 = 108 orange candies.

The bag has half as many yellow candies as red candies, so there are 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies.

Now, we know the total number of candies in the bag is 232. We can subtract the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from this total to find the number of pink candies.

232 - 54 (red) - 108 (orange) - 27 (yellow) = 43

Therefore, there are 43 pink candies in the bag.

"To find the total cost of Helen's trip, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel and the bus trips separately and then add them together.

The cost of the hotel for 3 nights is $80 * 3 = $240.

The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel, which is 0.1 * $80 = $8.

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus trips is $8 * 7 = $56.

The total cost of Helen's trip is the sum of the hotel cost and the bus trip cost: $240 + $56 = $296.

"To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we need to first determine how many marbles Dallas had initially. 

Dallas had 21 marbles after dropping 4, so we can calculate the initial number of marbles Dallas had by adding the marbles dropped to the marbles he had left: 21 + 4 = 25.

Since Mazie gave the marbles to both Dallas and Darla, the total number of marbles given away is 52. We know Dallas initially had 25 marbles, so we can subtract this from the total number of marbles given away to find out how many marbles Darla received: 52 - 25 = 27.

Therefore, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla.

"To calculate the total cost, we need to first calculate the cost of the tickets and the cost of the popcorns separately.

The cost of the tickets is 2 adult tickets + 1 child ticket = 2 * $12 + $8 = $24 + $8 = $32.

The cost of the popcorns is 2 * $3 = $6.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the tickets and the cost of the popcorns, which is $32 + $6 = $38.

The final answer is: $38"
"To calculate the total weight of the car and its contents, we need to add the weight of the car, the luggage, and the children.

Weight of the car = 1200 pounds
Weight of the luggage = 250 pounds
Weight of the children = 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we can calculate it as follows:

Force = 1% of 1600 pounds = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

Therefore, John needs to push the car with a force of 16 pounds.

"To determine the amount of crepe paper James needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of the fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet. 

Perimeter = 2 * (20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2 * 35
Perimeter = 70 feet

Therefore, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to hang the streamers around his backyard fence.

"To find the average of their ages, we need to first find their ages. 

Since Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart, Emma's age can be calculated by adding 16 to Mia's age. 

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now, we can find the average of their ages by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

The average of their ages is 48."

For the bowls, Avery needs 12 bowls at $5.00 each, so the total cost is:
12 * $5.00 = $60.00

For the salad plates, Avery needs 12 plates at $4.00 each, so the total cost is:
12 * $4.00 = $48.00

Now, we add the costs of all the plates together to get the total cost:

"To find out how much feed is left after a week, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed each pig eats in a week. 

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so in a day, each pig eats 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of feed. 

Since there are 7 days in a week, each pig eats 8 * 7 = 56 pounds of feed in a week.

Dexter has 5 pigs, so the total amount of feed eaten by all pigs in a week is 5 * 56 = 280 pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so the amount of feed left after a week is 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of children following the truck at the end of each street.

Initially, there are 5 children.

On the first street, 5 children join, making a total of 5 + 5 = 10 children.

On the second street, each of the 10 children is joined by another child, making a total of 10 + 10 = 20 children.

On the third street, each of the 20 children is joined by 2 children, making a total of 20 + 20 * 2 = 20 + 40 = 60 children.

However, the original 5 children then leave the group. So, we subtract 5 from the total number of children, which is 60 - 5 = 55 children.

Therefore, there are 55 children following the truck at the end.

"To find the total age of all the siblings, we need to determine the age of the older brother first. 

Since one brother is 12 years old and this is half the age of the older brother, we can calculate the older brother's age by multiplying 12 by 2. 

12 * 2 = 24

Now that we know the older brother is 24 years old, we can calculate the total age of all the siblings. 

The total age of the siblings is the sum of the ages of the brothers and the sisters. 

The total age of the brothers is 12 + 24 = 36. 
The total age of the sisters is 3 * 16 = 48.

"To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga practice, we need to calculate the time spent each week and then multiply it by the number of weeks.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes before sleep, so she spends 30 minutes per day on meditation. 

She practices 1 hour (60 minutes) of yoga 5 days a week. 

Total time spent on meditation per week: 30 minutes * 2 (morning and evening) = 60 minutes
Total time spent on yoga per week: 60 minutes * 5 days = 300 minutes

Total time spent on meditation and yoga per week: 60 minutes + 300 minutes = 360 minutes

Since there are 4 weeks, the total time spent on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks is: 360 minutes * 4 = 1440 minutes

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 1440 minutes / 60 = 24 hours.

"To find the total number of seeds, we first need to calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower. Since a dozen is equal to 12, a small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5, which equals 18. 

Now, we add the 50% more seeds to the number of seeds in a small sunflower: 36 + 18 = 54. 

The total number of seeds in a large sunflower is 54. 

To find the total number of seeds altogether, we add the seeds in the small sunflower to the seeds in the large sunflower: 36 + 54 = 90.

"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a 50% discount on the original price of $8 each. 

The original price of 2 T-shirts is 2 * $8 = $16.
The discount on 2 T-shirts is 50% of $16, which is 0.5 * $16 = $8.
The price of 2 T-shirts after the discount is $16 - $8 = $8.

Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, the cost of 1 T-shirt after the discount is $8 / 2 = $4.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and there is a 40% discount.

The discount on the shoes is 40% of $40, which is 0.4 * $40 = $16.
The price of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends at the store.

The total amount Jake spends is $4 (for 1 T-shirt) + $24 (for the shoes) = $28.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes created by the dog during Nate's vacation and then determine how many holes Nate fills per week.

Nate's dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes created is 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

Nate fills 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. This means that the net change in the number of holes per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes filled.

Since Nate fills 3 holes per day, we need to find out how many days it takes to fill 84 holes. 

To do this, we divide the total number of holes by the number of holes filled per day: 84 / 3 = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert 28 days to weeks by dividing by 7: 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

Therefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

We know that Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, so Igor gathered half as many, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

We also know that Igor gathered 2 more Petri dishes than requested, so the number of Petri dishes he gathered is 14 + 2 = 16.

The total number of items Igor gathered is 8 test tubes + 16 beakers + 16 Petri dishes = 40.

However, the total number of items he placed on the lab bench is 29. This means that the number of beakers he gathered is 40 - 29 = 11.

Since Igor gathered 16 beakers, the number of beakers he lost is 16 - 11 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the number of screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables. 

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, the total number of screws required for one table is 4 legs * 2 screws = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws required is 8 screws * 4 tables = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws. To find the number of screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws required from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8 screws.

James will have 8 screws left over."
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket. 

Since there are 10 eggs in the first basket and twice as many eggs in the second basket, we can calculate the number of eggs in the second basket as 2 * 10 = 20 eggs.

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets: 10 + 20 = 30 eggs.

The total number of eggs in both baskets is 30."
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount each girl raised and then add them together.

Alexandra raised $430.
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.
Sarah raised $300.

Now, let's add the amounts raised by each girl:
$430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2080.

The total amount of money raised is $2080."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the speeds and distances of Aaron and Vanessa. 

Let's denote Aaron's speed as A and Vanessa's speed as V. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, we can express this as A = 2V.

We also know that Vanessa ran 4 miles, and since she runs twice as far as Aaron, we can express this as 2A = 4. 

From the second equation, we can find Aaron's speed: A = 4 / 2 = 2 miles per minute.

Now, we know Aaron's speed is 2 miles per minute. Since Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, we can find the distance he ran: Distance = Speed * Time = 2 * 16 = 32 miles.

"To determine the total amount of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total length of line required for the existing dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, the total length of line required is 200 * 3 = 600 feet.

The caretaker already has 6 feet of line, so we subtract this from the total required length to find out how much more he needs to buy: 600 - 6 = 594 feet.

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total.

"To calculate the total revenue per night, we need to calculate the total cost of meals and add the cost of the wine.

Cost of meals per night: 6 reservations * 2 meals * $5 per meal = $60
Cost of wine per night: $5
Total cost per night: $60 + $5 = $65

Since they are open 2 days a week, the total revenue per week is:
$65 per night * 2 nights = $130 per week

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to first calculate the total cost and the total selling price.

The total cost of 50 watermelons is $80. 

Since the profit is 25%, we can calculate the total selling price as follows:

Total selling price = Total cost + (Total cost * Profit percentage)
Total selling price = $80 + ($80 * 0.25)
Total selling price = $80 + $20
Total selling price = $100

Now, we can find the selling price of each watermelon by dividing the total selling price by the number of watermelons:

Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons
Selling price per watermelon = $100 / 50
Selling price per watermelon = $2

The fruit vendor sold each watermelon for $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the current age of James and then find the current age of John's youngest son.

Since Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

James is twice as old as Dora, so James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John had a son James when he was 19, and James is now 18, so John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so John's youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time each person spends peeling oranges and then determine how many oranges each can peel in an hour.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

Since Ana peels 20 oranges and Jane peels 15 oranges in an hour, Ana will have peeled 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator first. 

The original price of the radiator is $400. Mark gets it for 80% off, so the discount is 80% of $400, which is 0.8 * $400 = $320. 

The discounted price of the radiator is $400 - $320 = $80.

Next, Mark hires a mechanic to install it for 3 hours at $50 an hour. The labor cost is 3 * $50 = $150.

The total cost is the sum of the discounted price of the radiator and the labor cost, which is $80 + $150 = $230.

The final answer is: $230."
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of legs each type of animal has. Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs. 

Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'b'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so c + b = 20. We also know that the total number of legs is 70, so 2c + 4b = 70.

We can solve this system of equations by first multiplying the first equation by 2 to get 2c + 2b = 40. Then, we subtract this equation from the second equation to get 2b = 30. Solving for b, we get b = 15.

Now that we know the number of cows, we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find the number of chickens: c + 15 = 20, so c = 5.

Therefore, Farmer Brown has 5 chickens.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, we need to find the total number of slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is 7 * 8 = 56.

Now, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people, which is 4 (Henry and his 3 friends). 

56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person.

The final answer is 14."
